<p>The South Korean government issued a report saying that after a leakage accident occurred in the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011, the concentration of the east seas of the eastern part of the Korean Peninsula did not significantly increase, saying that "our sea water is safe."</p>
<p>The Yonhap News Agency reported that Song Xianggen, deputy minister of the Ministry of Marine Aquatic Department of Marine, on Wednesday (June 21) at a press conference, explained the statement of the concentration of the Eastern Sea in the Eastern Sea on the seas of the Eastern Sea to two times after the nuclear accident.</p>
<p>Song Xianggen said that according to the "Ocean Nuclear Radiation Survey Report" issued by the Atomic Energy Safety Committee each year, 10 years after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident occurred, the 铯 -137 concentration of the eastern waters in South Korea was 0.001 to 0.002 Berchler. Five years ago, the 铯 -137 concentration in this sea area was 0.001 to 0.004 Berclerle per kilogram. It is difficult to say that the concentration of the 137 rose significantly after the incident.</p>
<p>Song Xianggen added that this value is not as good as the drinking water standard set by the WHO (WHO), which is a level of 3,600 in 3,600 Barkler per kilogram. He reiterated that our seawater is safe.</p>

<p>"Seoul News" quoted government sources on Tuesday (20th) that the Japanese authorities have decided not to dismiss South Korea to prohibit import Fukushima aquatic products and no longer appeal to the WTO.</p>
<p>In May 2015, Japan filed a complaint with the WTO due to the ban on the import of Fukushima aquatic products in South Korea, saying that this move was treated differently for Japanese aquatic products, and South Korea lost the lawsuit in 2018. However, in April 2019, Appelled by the World Trade Organization overthrew the "first instance judgment" and ruled that South Korea's approach did not belong to trade discrimination or unfair trade restrictions.</p>

<h3>Fukushima Nuclear Water Water Arrow on the Asian neighbors on the string of the Asian neighbor responded fiercely.</h3>
<p>June 21, 2023<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-21T05-59-58.000Z/_129147207_gettyimages-1240759567.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>In May 2022, Gross (second from right), director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, visited Japan and stood in front of a storage tank that stored nuclear waste water.</p>
<p><strong> After many years of domestic and foreign debates and several prime ministers come and go, the Japanese government plans to discharge more than 1.3 million tons of nuclear waste water in the Fukushima first nuclear power plant this summer into the Pacific Ocean, causing global attention and Asian neighbors. </strong></p>
<p>Because this is the first large -scale nuclear waste water discharge in human history, the controversy is huge. It includes food safety, marine pollution, and radioactive substances that affect human health and other issues, which caused excitement in Asia. Japanese neighboring countries and global environmental protection people are worried that nuclear waste water containing radioactive homogenicin (Tritium) into the ocean will cause great risks to the global human health and marine ecology and seriously affect fisheries. Beijing has taken the lead in criticizing Japan to disregard the safety of neighbors, and the Hong Kong and Macao government has also threatened to expand the scope of Japanese product imports.</p>
<p>Analyze the dispute over Fukushima Nuclear Water, and the host of the French National Research Center in Japan, Dr. Cécileasanuma-Brice, the host of the "Fukushima Disaster" plan, accepted the BBC Chinese interview that Japan had decided to restart nuclear power on a large scale and relieve it at the same time. After the evacuation order in the Fukushima disaster area, she believes that Tokyo is wiking all the traces of the nuclear disaster accident, "making the region a model area that Japan can resist the nuclear disaster accident. To achieve this goal, the government quickly removes all traces of the accident. It is important, but the existence of huge storage tanks will be visually reminded to remind everyone that such a disaster has happened in the past. "</p>
<p>Dr. Asanuma-Brice questioned the decision of wastewater discharge. She told BBC that global marine scientists have expressed concern about the impact of emissions on marine life and fisheries. She believes that the more wise plan is to continue to store and waste water until the radioactivity of the cricket is naturally reduced. "There are still space around the nuclear power plant and its range, and new storage tanks can be built."</p>
<p>However, the Japanese government emphasized that a water channel for processing and discharge wastewater has been built at the beach neighbor of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station. After completion, it will be discharged after being checked and confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Even so, it is only one step away from the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste water.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65107965">Japan's million -ton Fukushima nuclear waste water is discharged when you just drink a jar of peach juice? </a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-56970000">Scientific issues in Taiwan's Dispute Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, or diplomatic considerations</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-56927228">China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian used Ukiyo -e -pictures to satirize the nuclear wastewater to discharge the sea and cause controversy</a>BBC Chinese compiled various issues and debates caused by the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste water, including laws, ecological controversy, and the fierce response of Asian neighbors in Japan.</p>
<h3>Why is the Asian reaction fierce</h3>
<p><strong> China </strong> <strong> and Hong Kong and Macau </strong></p>
<p>Over the years, China has been opposed to the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste water. On June 12, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, criticized Japan to pollute the ocean and harm the common interests of human beings at a press conference, "extremely selfish and irresponsible." On May 27, the Chinese representatives criticized Tokyo's plans at the World Health Conference (WHA), asking Japan to not discharge nuclear waste water before reaching an agreement with governments of various countries.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Region Government is consistent with Beijing's attitude. It is believed that Japan can only act after communicating an agreement with the affected countries and the government.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Environment and Ecological Director Xie Zhanhuan accepted an exclusive interview with Radio last week that as soon as Japan announced the discharge of nuclear waste water, Hong Kong would immediately prohibit the import of aquatic products from the "highest risk county" along the coast of Fukushima. Aquatic products in other risky counties will also implement severe import control.</p>
<p>In fact, Hong Kong has banned vegetables, milk beverages and fruits from imports from Hong Kong, but does not include fruit juice. According to Hong Kong's "Ming Pao", Xie Zhanhuan said that food imported from Japan to Hong Kong accounted for only 2%of the overall food supply of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is expected to have a small impact, but it is understood that Hong Kong people love Japanese food "emotional influence".</p>
<p>In addition, a spokesman for Wellcom, one of the largest chain supermarkets in Hong Kong, responded to BBC Chinese in writing, "The company has always attached great importance to food safety. We welcome the government to strengthen the pumping Japanese food to ensure the safety of citizens." Pay attention to the future policies announced by the Hong Kong government, and will cooperate with and comply with relevant import and export requirements.</p>

<p>Fukushima nuclear waste water emissions: Is it safe and what substances are?</p>
<p>Macau announced stricter measures. The Macau Municipal Administration said on June 13 that once Japan began to discharge Fukushima nuclear waste water, it would suspend import applications such as aquatic products, vegetables and fruits including 9 counties and cities including Tokyo, Chiba Prefecture. The Macau Municipal Administration also said that it will not be ruled out that fresh food in other places to import Macau in other parts of Japan must also begin to attach radiation test certificates.</p>

<p>South Korean environmental protection groups held a demonstration in Seoul in 2022 to protest the Japanese nuclear wastewater discharge plan.</p>
<p>South Korea, which is separated from Japan, has not opposed Japanese discharge wastewater like the government this time, but South Korea has no plans to relieve the ban on Fukushima food. However, since 2013, the South Korean government has banned the import of all aquatic products from neighboring counties such as Fukushima Prefecture, Ibaraki Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture in Japan, and the rice and mushrooms in the production of Fukushima Prefecture to South Korea.The Hong Kong media "South China Morning Post" quoted data that a thousand people's transfer in South Korea showed that more than 85%of Koreans were opposed to Japanese discharge wastewater. 70%of the respondents said that if they continue to discharge wastewater, they will reduce edible seafood.</p>

<p>The nuclear sewage storage tank of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan will be used up in 2022. How to deal with more than 1 million tons of sewage will be a major issue for Japan and abroad.</p>
<p>Many Korean fishermen are also deeply anxious about nuclear waste water discharge.</p>
<p>Kim Eun'e (transliteration) from Jeju Island told the BBC Korean group, "From a broad sense, we think we are marine creatures because we use our own body to enter the water directly. When we work In our mouths, we also enter our eyes, nose and skin. We dive for about five hours a day -this means that we are at the front line of potential danger. "</p>
<p>Ms. Jin said, "I am in my forties and the youngest sea girl in our village. I think I stand on the crossroads. I am seriously considering whether this should be my last year. For us This is not only an economic problem, but also a matter of life and death. "</p>
<p>Another fisherman who lives in Toriyama Park Xijun (transliteration) told BBC that "In fact, radioactive substances may not enter our sea area. I am also anxious. Young people who come here to work here are just waiting and watching. They are ready to return to the city. "</p>

<p>Many people think that there are land next to the Fukushima nuclear power plant to continue to store nuclear waste water (May 2023).</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan</strong></p>
<p>It is also located in East Asia, and the Taiwan government does not discharge the wastewater in Fukushima in Japan. The Taiwan Executive Yuan Atomic Energy Committee stated that it would pay close attention and emphasize that the discharge of nuclear waste water from Fukushima will mainly move with the North Pacific Ocean to the East Pacific and the United States. Only a small part will flow to Taiwan. The sea area has been further diluted.</p>
<p>In February last year, Taiwan announced the loosening food control measures in Fukushima in Japan and five counties around the world, but mushrooms and wild birds and beast meat were still prohibited. Former President Ma Ying -jeou attacked the Cai government at the time to disregard public opinion. However, the Kuomintang is also asking the Taiwan government to restart the nuclear power, and Hou Youyi, a 2024 presidential candidate representing the Kuomintang, recently said that he will support the continued use of nuclear power. The wealthy Taiwanese businessman Guo Taiming also said that the nuclear power is clean and safe. A nuclear power plant has caused public opinion.</p>

<p>Fukushima Daxiong Town's nuclear waste burial plant. (May 2023)</p>
<p>The "National Waste Nuclear Action Platform" of environmental protection groups voiced last year and actively opposed Japan to discharge nuclear waste water into the sea, saying that Japan should not consider the cost of filtering wastewater, and put the environmental ecology, marine fisheries and people's health in neighboring countries on the threat of radiation pollution. Among them. A fisherman surnamed Wang in Wanli, the North Coast of New Taipei City, told Taiwan Union News Network that "it is best not to be discharged into the seawater." Mr. Wang said that the fishermen next to him have opinions on Japanese emissions of nuclear waste water, which will inevitably affect fisheries: "In Japan, the floating stone floated to the north coast of Taiwan, and the fishermen were damaged. If you can't see it, the impact will exceed imagination. "</p>
<h3>Can the law prevent emissions?</h3>
<p>In June 2020, UN human rights experts have publicly called on Tokyo's human rights obligations for the process of nuclear waste treatment. After the United Nations hopes that Japan will start an appropriate international consultation after the new crown epidemic crisis is over, and then decide whether to discharge nuclear waste water. Based on this, Greenpeace emphasized that how nuclear waste water handles the far -reaching impact on humans and the earth for several generations, and it is also related to the livelihood of local fishermen in Japan and human rights of people in other countries.</p>
<p>However, in addition to calling for negotiation dialogue, can outsiders prevent Japanese discharge nuclear waste water through legal channels?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64382410">Japan once represented the future, but it was trapped in the past</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-62689676">Can the town of "sleeping" in Japan really turn gorgeously into Silicon Valley in Asia? </a>Professor Rao Ruizheng, dean of the School of Marine Law and Policy of Taiwan Ocean University, told Taiwan media that there were three successful cases of nuclear disaster claims in human history, including the 1979 US three mile island accidents, and the Soviet Union's Chenobil (Chelnobelli in 1986 ) Nuclear disasters, critical accidents in Donghai Village, Japan in 1999, etc., "If you are required to succeed and win a lawsuit, the key is to prove whether there is a causal relationship."</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's "whether it is really harmless to the marine environment, ecology and human health", there are major differences in different countries and groups.</p>

<p>BBC Documentary: Ten Anniversary of Fukushima Nuclear Incident in Japan</p>
<p>Professor Rao Ruizheng explained to the BBC that this is a scientific factual issue that must be handled and demonstrated through scientific methods. In terms of international law, if the Convention of the International Nuclear Energy Damage, or Article 194 of the United Nations Marine Law Convention in 1982, can all require Japan's legal liability for pollution prevention obligations and damage compensation. "However, the premise must be scientifically harmful in science and cause and effect."</p>
<p>According to the convention, countries can apply to the International Oceanic Court for a ban to prevent the nuclear waste water discharge plan. But no country has filed a lawsuit.The Green Peace Organization stated that its position is unchanged and believes that the Japanese government should use surrounding land to build more water storage sinks, store waste water, and seek more secure solutions.</p>

<h3>"何" is the key?</h3>
<p>Regarding the Fukushima nuclear waste water, many scientists focus on the controversy of "氚" residue. Simply put, 种 is a kind of radioactin of hydrogen, which generally exists after nuclear reactions. After 311, water contaminated with high concentration of radioactive substances after nuclear disaster. Although purified and diluted, the wastewater still contains crickets. The Japanese government emphasizes the treatment of nuclear waste water without residual radioactive pollutants except radioactive. In other words, only wastewater containing waste water will be excreted into the ocean. Moreover, Tokyo believes that the nuclear waste water containing crickets will only produce very weak radiation, which will not be harmful to ocean or human health.</p>
<p>However, green peace emphasizes that 氚 is indeed a low -energy radioactive substance, but it does not mean that its influence is weak, and once plants, animals and humans are intake, it may cause damage. The organization's nuclear energy researcher Shaunbernie wrote that 氚 is not harmless as the Japanese government's propaganda.</p>

<p>The Japanese government decided to discharge Fukushima nuclear waste water in the spring of 2023. The Japanese fishery industry was opposed, and neighboring China, South Korea and Taiwan also expressed questioning.</p>
<p>Regardless of its position, if Japan discharged nuclear waste water this summer, in Japan and Asian countries, it will inevitably have a great impact and controversy. Dr. Asanuma-Brice told BBC that she believed that the most seriously affected local residents of Fukushima, especially fishermen. "For them, this decision is catastrophic and causes harm to their work."</p>
<p>She said that although Tokyo has implemented active publicity policies to allow the public to accept nuclear waste water discharge, polls show that about half of the people in Japan still have about half of their objections.</p>
<p>Dr. Asanuma-Brice said that the marine ecosystem will also be affected because even if similar pollution already exists elsewhere, the discharge of nuclear waste water will still form additional pollution. She emphasized that some scientists (such as the Director of the Kavaro Marine Lab, Richmond) also said that radioactive nuclear may spread with the ocean flow and will bring marine creatures (such as floating plants) who migrate long -term migration in the ocean for a long time. And floating plants are the basis of all marine biological food chains.</p>
<p>"The current problem is uncertainty. It is better to take more time to consider various possible solutions." She told BBC.</p>

<p>Description: A latest poll of the Australian think tank shows that most people in the country support Sino -Australian relations, but the interviewees are still very low in trust in Chinese President Xi Jinping. The polls also show that if China attacks Taiwan, most Australians will support responses to economic sanctions and weapons supply, but less than half of the people will support directly sending troops to participate.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) The signing ceremony is ongoing in a hall of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs. The BMW company signed a statement with the China National Development and Reform Commission; Mercedes -Benz also signed a document with the Development and Reform Commission; the Ministry of Education of China and Volkswagen Corporation and Volkswagen Company trained professionals to deepen cooperation and signing contracts. Prime Minister Shulz made a 4 -minute speech, and then Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang gave a 14 -minute speech. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/难度高悬念大德中政府磋商全面开启/a-65972739">At first glance, everything is as usual</a>, Back to the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2023-06/deutsch-chinesische-regierungskonsultationen-berlin-olaf-scholz-li-qiang/komplettansicht">Published in "Time Online" entitled "Let's continue becoming a friend"</a>The author wrote, "Slow!Isn't it a cold, criticism of Germany and China relations?" "Now, the new Chinese Prime Minister and the accompanying ministers have ended <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体柏林铺开红地毯/a-65979543">two -day government consultation</a>After that, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德中政府磋商不能提问的总理新闻发布会/a-65978567">Berlin released a very friendly signal</a>The two sides agreed with the follow -up of cooperation. In addition to strengthening trade and scientific exchanges, the two countries have also agreed to host the German and Central Environment Forum this fall. In the field of electric vehicles and hydrogen energy, the two countries hope to strengthen cooperation. "The author noticed that, unlike previously, (Tuesday) the agreement signed in the Ministry of Economic Affairs was not a billion -dollar list.</p>
<p>"The clear goal of the German federal government is to reduce the damage that may be suffered due to dependence on China. Germany is China's most important trading partner in Europe. Out of economic benefits, it is not meaningless to maintain cooperation between the two countries. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国与中国压力山大的伙伴关系/a-65941273">The question is: how far it should go</a>Intersection "</p>
<p>"At present, Berlin's statement is 'to risk', that is, the risk brought by the intertwined economic bonds, not the" decoupling "that some politicians in Washington are more hopeful, that is, completely get rid of China. The Prime Minister's Palace said to Li Qiang: 'We have no interest in the decoupling with China'.</p>
<p>At the German -China Economic and Technological Cooperation Forum in the afternoon, Shulz emphasized that risk does not mean giving up globalization and world trade, and its significance lies in fair trade. "</p>
<h3>is how to re -position relations with China</h3>
<h3><strong> China’s self -sufficient dream has already begun </strong></h3>
<p>"Focus" magazine published an article pointed out that <a href="https://www.focus.de/finanzen/scholz-und-biden-traeumen-von-china-trennung-doch-xi-dreht-den-spiess-einfach-um_id_196998229.html">Berlin and Washington are trying to get rid of the situation of economy dependence on China</a>, But Xi Jinping's counter -control strategy has been implemented.</p>
<p>The author believes that Premier Shaws said that when the Ministers from China conducted government consultations, "supporting risks and opposing decoupling", this is just an echo of the White House tone. "Using this kind of words, Western politicians want people to know that they are the promoters of history. But do not know that Beijing's deeper self -sufficient dream has already begun." "We will have two scholars in front of us, involving culture and culture, Economy and military ", and the process of gradually drifting in China includes a number of steps: control the Internet, value -added chain nationalization, the establishment of a bank payment system that creates super borders, and develop the southern hemisphere country:</p>
<p>"China is working hard to develop the southern hemisphere country: this is particularly important for China. As early as 2012, China replaced the West to become the largest direct investment country in Africa-up to $ 4 billion in local investment every year. China’ s infrastructure in construction is there. When hardware and software products, they also consolidated their own standards, including monitoring of the Internet.</p>
<p>China has established 25 economic and trade cooperation centers in 16 African countries. McKinsey Consulting estimates that the output value of Chinese companies accounts for 12%of African industrial production, with a total value of up to $ 500 billion per year.</p>
<p>China's business in the economic field has continued to promote in the military field. At present, China plans to build a military base with Cuba. This set of facilities will become an integral part of the overseas global military network of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is also a answer to the United States' relations with Taiwan. As a famous saying in the Bible: It also cures its body with its own way. "</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that China and Cuba have reached an agreement on the establishment of a new monitoring station in Cuba in principle. The two sides have jointly operated four eavesdropping stations in Cuba. This eavesdropping network has experienced a major upgrade around 2019.</p>

The picture shows the National Day of 2022, a group of protesters appealed to the Chinese government in London, UK to give people human rights (data photo)</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In a human rights report that tracks social, economic and political freedom, it is pointed out that although China has scored high in food, health and housing, China is still listed as the worst in citizenship in the world in the world. nation. In addition, the suppression of the National Security Law has also reduced Hong Kong's scores in recent years.</p>
<p>The British "Guardian" reported that the non -governmental organization "Human Rights Evaluation initiative" (HRMI), which is headquartered in New Zealand, has been monitoring human rights performance in various countries since 2017. According to the latest reports, China is the country with the worst human rights record in many indicators. In terms of arbitrarily arrests, only Kazakhstan scores lower than China.</p>
<p>However, in terms of economic indicators such as food, health and housing rights, China's scores are relatively high, which is close to the list among more than 100 countries that have been investigated. In the part of the economic indicators, HRMI uses public statistics released by governments and international institutions, instead of investigating separately.</p>
<p>The index also pointed out that some people in China, such as government critics and ethnic minorities, often lose their basic economic rights.</p>
<p>The index tracks citizenship and political rights by investigating reporters from various countries, non -governmental organization staff, and lawyers. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/维权律师万言书-揭709案内幕/a-64110726">These areas are strictly controlled in China</a>Therefore, it is very difficult to collect accurate data.</p>
<p>From 2019 to 2020, health scores in most countries or regions have fallen, which reflects a large number of deaths caused by the new crown virus. However, before the loosening of the clearing policy, China, which was relatively low, remained stable in this score.</p>
<p>In addition, since 2022, HRMI has begun to track the freedom of religion and belief in various countries for the first time. And China ’s score on this indicator is also the worst. The research of this indicator includes only 9 countries.</p>
<p>"We attach great importance to investigating the security and guarantee of the respondents, and said for many years," said HRMI spokesman Thalia KehoErowden, and said for many years.</p>
<p>"One of the keys to maintaining security is to investigate anonymous in an encrypted online form, so no one can know who participated exactly, or what they said," Luoden added.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T01-57-00Z/62992263_401.jpg" />In July 2022, a group of Uighur women protested outside the Chinese Embassy in London, England (data photo)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong scores decreased</h3>
<p>The British "Guardian" reported that although the score was not as bad as China, the HRMI index in Hong Kong has continued to decline in recent years <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/22/hong-kong-plunges-lower-in-global-human-rights-index">. </a>Since the Hong Kong Government's suppression of the democratic movement in 2019 and 2020, democracy has been rapidly reduced. In these years, Hong Kong's ranking of free rally has dropped by nearly 40%.</p>
<p>According to HRMI data, Hong Kong ’s expression of freedom has increased by 33%. HRMI also concluded that Hong Kong's scores in free arrest index increased, an increase of 85%. But this is because the index is caused by an example of actual violations.</p>
<p>"In the Hong Kong National Security Law]," <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英国呼吁取消香港国安法-港府强烈反驳/a-65743070">Hong Kong National Security Law</a>) Under this suppression background, it is not good news for the increase of arrest and detention. This just means that the suppression is playing a role. "</p>
<p>"Hong Kong's democratic rights and freedom scores fell sharply from 2019-2021, and it is still amazingly low," Luo Deng said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T01-57-00Z/65820310_401.jpeg" />After the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong's human rights scores have also begun to decline.</p>
<h3>UN Human Rights High School wants to set up an office in China</h3>
<p>Reuters reports that Volkerturk, a senior person in Human Rights Affairs, called on Monday (19th) to call on all walks of life to provide more support for their offices, because he seeks the first two countries in the world: India and China established services Places to expand their work. The human rights records of these two countries are facing more criticism.</p>
<p>At the end of 2022, Tuck took over as the UN Human Rights College. He urged cooperation in the opening speech of the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, and specifically pointed out that Syria, Iran, Israel, and Russia should take more actions. Turk also believes that "the establishment of a business in China and India for the first time is important to us."</p>
<p>China or India's Genova diplomatic mission did not immediately respond to Reuters' comment requests.</p>
<p>For Tuck's office, it may be difficult to set up offices in China. A UN Human Rights spokesman said that Turk discussed the idea of setting up two new offices during his meeting with governments, but did not explain the response to the media in detail.</p>

<p>After 10 consecutive high interest rates, the Federal Public Marketing Committee (FOMC) suspended last week to suppress the interest rate hikes in high inflation, so that decision officials have more time to evaluate US economic strength.</p>
<p>Ball said today: "Almost all FOMC members expect that further interest rate hikes at the end of the year will be appropriate."</p>
<p>Since March 2022, the Fed has raised a benchmark borrowing interest rate of 5 percentage points, which has raised interest rates from nearly zero to 5.0%and 5.25%. However, despite the positive increase of interest rates, US inflation is still much higher than the 2%goal of the Fed's long -term period.</p>
<p>"We still have a long way to go, but we are going, but we are progressing."</p>

This is one of the longest sentences to date.</p>
<p>However, the 40 -year -old Daniel Rodriguez performed well. Under the escort of law enforcement officers, he shouted "Trump won" when he came out of the Federal District Court of Washington.</p>
<p>Only two other defendants were sentenced to a longer sentence in the attack of the Capitol.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T02-38-44/2-1687400464.jpg" />U.S. Congress riots: Members suggested that allegations to Trump</p>
<p>When sentenced, Judge Emi Berman Jackson said Rodriguez was a "hatred of hatred, attacking the police and destroying property during the incident on January 6, 2021."</p>
<p>That day, the supporters of the then President Donald Trump rushed into the parliamentary building to try to destroy the certification of the voting of the election group in the 2020 election. Trump wrongly claimed that the election was manipulated to explain his failure in that campaign.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Judge Jackson rejected the argument of the defense, that is, Rodriguez was just misleading by Trump's "irresponsible and intentional lie".</p>
<p>Jackson told Rodriguez that "you appear in the (Washington) Special Economic Zone, you can't bear to fight. Once you arrive there, you can't blame anyone you do, except yourself."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Rodriguez provided his own statement to the court and explained his behavior. He said, "I did something right at that time."</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that the metropolis policeman Michael Fanone suffered "huge pain", and the latter's portable camera captured the electric shock gun attack.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said, "I hope that Michael French farmers will get better one day."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T02-38-44/3-1687400469.jpg" />The former police officer Michael Faron said that the incident on January 6, 2021 ended his law enforcement career(Reuters)However, Faron walked out of court in Rodriguez's 25 -minute speechless speech.</p>
<p>Later, the former police officer told the Associated Press, "What he said to me today will not have any impact."</p>
<p>He believes that the incident on January 6 ended his law enforcement career.</p>
<p>At that time, Farn was caught up by a thug, beaten and dragged down the steps of the parliamentary building, and therefore suffered heart disease, burns and brain injuries. Since then, he has made his own experience before investigating the attack on the attack of the parliamentary building.</p>
<p>Earlier, Rodriguez had acknowledged four felony allegations in February, including attacking law enforcement officers, obstructing judicial justice, conspiracy, and obstructing official lawsuits.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T02-38-44/4-1687400481.jpg" />Where are they now? On January 6, the faces of riots in the US Congress Building</p>
<p>Prosecutors accused Rodriguez helped lead a Telegram chat team called "Patriots45magagang". Trump's supporters gathered and organized there before the attack.</p>
<p>According to his indictment, Rodriguez once told someone that he would "assassinate Joe Bayeng" and "would rather live under the rule of Biden's government." He also wrote in group chat: "Blood will occur there. Welcome to revolution."</p>
<p>Soon after, he and other members of the chat group drove through the entire country from California to participate in the Trump "Stop The STEAL" assembly held in Washington, DC on January 6, 2021.</p>
<p>After the rally, thousands of mobs, including Rodriguez, gathered in a joint meeting to confirm the results of the election results.</p>
<p>Prosecutor said Rodriguez participated in the "Heave-Ho" operation to try to push away a team of police officers in the double door of the Parliament building. They also claimed that someone saw him throwing a flagpole and spraying fire extinguisher at law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>It is said that another thugs once provided him with a "shock weapon" and he attacked the police with it. At that time, the mobs pulled forward the Farun, and Rodriguez was accused of hitting the police's neck twice with an electric shock gun. Fannon finally lost consciousness.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T02-38-44/5-1687400488.jpg" />Timeline: On January 6, the US Congress Building riots(Peninsula TV Station)As part of a wide range of investigations, the Ministry of Justice has accused more than 1,000 crimes related to the attack on the Capitol. Nearly 500 people have been sentenced.</p>
<p>However, few other defendants were sentenced to such a long sentence like Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Last month, the leader of Oath Keepers, the leader of the Right -wing, was sentenced to 18 years in prison, which is the longest sentence to date. Prosecutors have wanted 25 people.</p>
<p>Prior to Raz, the longest sentence was the 14 -year imprisonment of Peter Schwartz, Kentucky, and the prosecutor accused him of breaking through the warning line of the Congress and spraying pepper to the retired police.</p>
<p>Like Rodriguez, the "Oath Guardian" organized the leader of the Florida Branch Kelly Megs and was also sentenced to 12 years in prison. He was sentenced to Rosz in May.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-22T02-59-00-00-00/000161891_piclink.jpg" />In view of the significance of Sino -German economic relations to the economic and trade relations between the two countries and even the China -Europe, the seventh Sino -German government consultation in Berlin is undoubtedly attracted great attention from the international community. These concerns are around a core, that is, will China and Germany and even China -Europe relations be alienated? This was caused by the profound impact of the Russian and Ukraine on geopolitics and economy, and the result of the re -judgment of China in Europe and the United States through the three -year epidemic situation.</p>
<p>However, looking at the current situation of the world and China and Europe will find that the prospects of the international community are unlikely to happen. Basically, the two countries can basically keep the current status of China -German economic and trade relations, and there will be no big ups and downs; but in turn, China -Germany economic and trade relations will never return to the sweet past, because after the past three years, the world has been different. People are wrong.</p>

<h3>Brinton will Xi Jinping: China and the United States will restore the "lip gun war" before and after the recovery of high -level visits after five years</h3>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Xi Jinping (middle) meeting with Brinden (left) in the Fujian Hall in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing attracted widespread discussion.</p>
<p><strong> U.S. Secretary of State AntonyBlinken ended the first visit to China for the first five years in China after meeting Xi Jinping, the Chinese President Xi Jinping, and transferred to the UK to visit, but the discussion about China was not over. </strong></p>
<p>The last time the US Secretary of State visited China and met Xi Jinping dates back to June 2018, Pompeo visited China twice in June and October of that year, but the second visit did not see Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>In the two -day visits of Brinken, both China and the United States proposed to have a stable relationship, but the United States seemed to be able to restart military communication channels. China emphasizes that the United States should "reflect" for the stalemate of the current bilateral relations, and there are nothing more important among the issues of Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>After Brinken left China, US President Joebiden first described US -China relations on the "correct track", and then publicly criticized Xi Jinping as a "dictator" after one day, which once again attracted strong criticism in Beijing.</p>
<p>Although it is generally commented that Brinken's visit to China has taken an important step in restoring the healthy development of bilateral relations, many observers pointed out to the BBC that whether it can truly return to normal is still to be carefully observed.</p>

<p>The meeting between Blintken and Xi Jinping was announced about an hour before the held.</p>
<p>From the moment Brinton launched the plane at the Beijing Capital Airport on June 18, both Chinese netizens and overseas observer are paying attention to what he is treated -there is no red carpet on the apron, only the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chang Yang Tao's pick -up; Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on the "strict stance and clear requirements" on the Taiwan issue "clarifying a strict position and making clear requirements"; Wang Yi, director of the Foreign Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "asked the United States to stop the hype of the" Chinese threat "and cancel illegal unilateral sides of China. Sanctions, abandoning the development of Chinese science and technology, and not allowing China to interfere with China's internal affairs. "</p>
<p>By the afternoon of the 19th, the outside world learned that Xi Jinping was determined to meet Brinkeit. In the 35 minutes of the Fujian Hall in the Great Hall of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping sat alone in the center of the long table, and the left and right officials were officials. Observer and even netizens have retrieved photos of the former US Secretary of State, such as Mikepompeo, Rex Tillerson, and John Kerry, and found that this move has never been seen. Former Minister of the Interior, current affairs commentator Xu Guoyong <a href="https://www.ftvnews.com.tw/news/detail/2023620W0346">even described it as "dynasty -style faces"</a>Essence</p>
<p>Former US State Department East Asia and Pacific Affairs Assistant Secretary of State State Steve, Brid Gen Davidstilwell, said to BBC: "Both sides are still saying those notch and itchy statements, saying that they seek balanced relationships, but when he got off the plane, he only got lower -level than him to get off the plane. Many people receive, this visual effect is a strong information for the purpose of humiliation. "</p>
<p>"The heavier is Xi Jinping's setting at the top of the table. The Chinese sitting on one side, the United States sitting on the other side, basically like a subordinate, Xi Jinping is like meeting with these people. Go down. "</p>
<p>Steve said: "No one has seen diplomatic arrangements like this. This is completely non -standard."</p>
<p>Professor Prof Shirleyyu, a senior visit researcher at the London School of Political Economics (LSE) and the director of China -Africa Project, described in an interview with the BBC connection. This time, Xi Jinping appeared in the center of the conference hall to look at the transcendent status of foreign officials between China and the United States.</p>

<p>Netease's self -media article described that the meeting between Xi Jinping and Brinken was held in the Fujian Hall, and the background oil painting of the Fujian Hall is "Wuyi Spring". "This hint should be very clear. The core interests, there is no room to talk about. "</p>
<p>According to the official website of the National People's Congress of China, since the era of Deng Xiaoping's main administration, the Fujian Hall is the place where the CCP's top leaders have met with foreign guests.</p>
<p>On Weibo, a Heilongjiang user believes that the layout in the Fujian Hall "must give him a psychological impact, which not only makes him feel flattered and strongly suppressed." A Guangdong netizen said: "Our leaders sitting in the sites sitting in In the middle of the table, Brinken is sitting like our minister's work. I hope it can be a bit memorable. "</p>
<p>A Zhejiang netizen believes that there is no red carpet on the airport's apron, but there is a red line.</p>

<p>One day after the talks of Brinken Beijing, Biden said Xi Jinping's "dictator"</p>
<p>On Twitter (Twitter), some US netizens questioned that Biden "changed his mouth" to criticize Xi Jinping, in fact, it was because of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtvdmGENnOh/">Son Hunter Biden "</a>The news of the crime of charges such as tax illegal and drug abuse and the holding of guns holding a gun, so we must transfer the attention of public opinion. But this action still attracted questions about Biden's ability.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted Professor Wu Xinbo, the dean of the International Institute of International Issues and the Director of the American Research Center of Shanghai Fudan University, said: "Biden's big mouth likes nonsense." But he did not think that this would make Brinken's efforts to the east.</p>
<p>Sun Yun, the director of the Chinese project of the Washington Think Tank Stimsoncenter, also said to Reuters: "I bet Washington wants to make it quietly dilute, and China does not want a small question to do it, which will cause the bilateral summit in November and Biden in November."</p>
<p>The United States will host the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leader summit in San Francisco in November. Before Brinton set off to Beijing, Biden publicly stated that "I hope I will meet Xi Jinping again in the next few months."</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Jialuo of the Hong Kong Baptist University does not think that Biden, who is seeking re -election, described Xi Jinping as a "dictator".</p>
<p>Chen Jialuo said to BBC in Chinese: "Once Bayeng talked about the Chinese issue during the campaign, it is easy to return to its dual world thinking, that is, different regimes have its essential differences. China and Russia will be regarded as For this so -called democratic camp led by the United States, or the main competitive object, "</p>
<p>"This will affect the future Sino -US relations, so that the US foreign policy."</p>

<p>There are different comments on the results of Brinken's visit to China.</p>
<p>The Chinese official was published in the order of the conversation between China and Bronken's dialogue, and its tone seemed to have been changing repeatedly.After Biden made a "dictator" speech, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/wjdt_674879/sjxw_674887/202306/t20230621_11101653.shtml">morning on the 21st</a>Yang Tao also criticized the United States on the evening of the 19th to criticize the United States on Taiwan's position, saying that the United States "tampered with its political commitment."</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The root cause of Sino -US relations falling into the trough is that the United States has a wrong recognition of China. This situation does not meet the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, nor does it meet the common expectations of the international community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sino -US relations have gone through twists and turns. It is necessary for the United States to reflect deeply, maintain the political foundation of Sino -US relations, and deal with accidental occasional incidents in calmness, professional, and rational treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The priority is to truly implement the consensus of the head of state in Bali of the two countries, reverse the spiral decline of Sino -US relations, and promote the return of health and stable tracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urges the United States not to use the template of the "National Qiang Bit" to mirror China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue of Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk. It urges the United States to clearly oppose "Taiwan independence", stop hype "Chinese threat theory", cancel "illegal unilateral sanctions against China ", Abandon the development of China's science and technology, must not interfere with China's internal affairs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Professor Wang Yong, a professor at the School of International Relations of Peking University, said in an interview with BBC that Brinken held a long meeting with China, "it should still have achieved certain results."</p>
<p>Professor Wang Yong said: "I think for both parties, to improve their understanding of each other and increase mutual trust, there are many benefits. From this perspective, the highest diplomats between the two countries sit down and talk about it. ","</p>

<p>After Brinken left Beijing, <a href="http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0621/c1001-40018273.html">CCTV</a>And <a href="https://tv.cctv.com/2023/06/20/VIDEOEe99aEJ7NWKrxULoKfU230620.shtml">the Communist Party of the People's Daily</a>Two days a long time reported "The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to publicize the advanced deeds of the Air Force Air Force's two flights to the two teams of the Air Force and award them.

<p>As Brinken left Beijing, Sarahberan, senior director of the White House National Security Conference, said publicly that resumed dialogue between the two armies was the "absolutely critical way to manage the competition between the two countries and conduct crisis communication.</p>
<p>"We are still willing to meet at various levels (with the Chinese military) and urge China to give appropriate responses at various levels (with the Chinese military)."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blinken-xi-china-talks-military-communication/">Brinken said before leaving Beijing to the United States Colombia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS)</a>: "This is a matter of doing things. This is what we need to do for the interests of the two countries. Not only the establishment, rebuilding and strengthening the communication line between our government ... But one of the important parts is the military's pair Military (Communication). "</p>

<p>China and the United States have recently accused each other due to the "Cuban Spy Station" dispute.</p>
<p>In 2018, the United States issued a sanctions order to the current Chinese Defense Minister, the current Minister of Defense, the current Minister of Defense in Russia, which seemed to be [early June] <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65788097">early June</a>US Secretary of Defense Llaydaustin sought the main obstacles to meeting Li Shangfu during the Shangri -La dialogue. So, can the sanction of Li Shangfu create conditions for breaking through the deadlock?</p>
<p>Kobberg, who participated in the Shangri -La dialogue in Singapore, said to BBC: "This is possible. I personally don't think that the Minister of Defense, which sanction in China, is a good idea. China is a powerful country and naturally needs to be treated appropriately."</p>
<p>"But I think a bigger problem is that based on unknown reasons, in fact, I want to use the attempt to alleviate the relationship between the Biden government ... so I think this is a very dangerous situation for the United States."</p>
<p>Former American Assistant Secretary of State State believes that the reason why Brinken failed to make progress in the dialogue between the two armies, "because China does not want to (communicate with the U.S. military), and we have not allowed them to talk to us.""We didn't chase them. They felt that they were ready and came to the door. They could only be like this with this group of people (China). They were not as much as we value these dialogues."</p>

Therefore, the Bayeng government has more coordination between representatives of Eagle and his desire to improve China. "</p>
<h3>Taiwan problem re -express</h3>
<p>After meeting with Xi Jinping, Blingken said that he reiterated from the Chinese government to the "one China" policy of Washington, and did not support Taiwan's independence. He did not want to change the status quo on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>

<p>"The United States has a trend now, which will solve the peace of Taiwan with the" Policies of the One China "as the core content of the" One China Policy ". This is not the reiteration and persistence of the US political commitment to the United States, but tampering with tampering."</p>
<p>Prior to this, Xinhua News Agency said that Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang stated to Brinken that "Taiwan's issue is the core of China's core interests, the most significant issue of Sino -US relations, and the most prominent risk."</p>

He believes that the Taiwan issue is the "red line in the red line" in Beijing, and the war of Russia and Ukraine has brought "catastrophic impact" to Europe and the world.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we cannot let the Sino -US battle out of control. In the Asia -Pacific region, such a tragedy, especially in the United States, should give up the Taiwan issue as a piece of chess to curb China's development. One of the legal rights and interests of China's core interests. "</p>
<p>"I don't think it is an excessive requirement for the United States. In fact, it is a very reasonable requirement. To deal with the Taiwan issue, it is also very good for the status and influence of the United States in the Asia -Pacific region."</p>

<p>Taiwan Foreign Minister Wu Zhaozheng said in an exclusive interview with the BBC recently that the tensions on both sides of the strait "may affect other parts of the world."</p>
<p>Taipei welcomed Brinken's statement to China. <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=95&amp;sms=73&amp;s=114947">Taiwan Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 20th</a>: "The peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is the core of the security and prosperity of the Indo -Pacific region.

"</p>
<p>Zheng Wencan, deputy dean of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, also said that the relationship between Taiwan and the United States will not be affected by Blint's visit to China, and all cooperation will be on the track.</p>
<p>Kobeji, the founder of the "Marathon initiative", believes that Brinken's statement on Taiwan's issue is appropriate; Professor Bai Jiexi of the University of Cornell University in the United States said: "I expect the United States to represent the risk of risks of military hostility worldwide. If China takes the initiative, it will not only endanger the global economy, but also endanger China's own sustainable growth and modernization. "</p>
<p>Both Taiwan and the United States have entered the election ticket period. How will this affect the development of Sino -US relations centered on the situation of the Taiwan Strait? Dr. Chen Jialuo of the Hong Kong Baptist University pointed out that from the perspective of the United States, polls show that whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican supporters, whether it is the issue of Taiwan or other Chinese human rights issues, their attitude towards China is negative. No matter who entering the White House, mutual suspicion between China and the United States will make the wrestling of the two countries the main axis of bilateral relations in the next few years.</p>

One is that they do not want to have children, and the other is that there are many single ones.</p>

The cases of Li Qiaochu, who were charged with "inciting the crime of subverting the state power", were unable to judge as scheduled due to various reasons.</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/2-04192023113346.html">After Xu Zhiyong was re -sentenced, Li Qiaochu hopes to meet with his family in prison</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-12122022113952.html">The Dutch Embassy in China presented the human rights award information to the rights defendant in prison, Li Qiaochu, which was blocked by Weibo</a></em>*</p>
<p>Feminist Li Qiaochu was charged with the case of "inciting the crime of subverting the state power." Lawyer Li Guobei is not allowed to enter the court. Yu Kai, another representative of the same case, was rejected to the court's request to retrieve evidence and other requirements. He took the initiative to relieve the entrustment to withdraw from the court to show protests so that the case could not be completed. The Chinese Human Rights Lawyer Group quoted Yu Kai in Twitter: "We will leave the 'Chengtang for Certificate', not in court, but in history."</p>
<p>Luo Shengchun, the wife of Ding Jiaxi who understands the situation, told this station that Chinese law has stipulated that lawyers enter the court without security, but the court used illegal means to prevent the lawyers from representing Li Qiaochu from going to court. She emphasized that Li Qiaochu was innocent.</p>
<p>Luo Shengchun: "Li Qiaochu's case, they just have nothing to do, mainly because they don't want to lead Chu to Xu Zhiyong outside, so they pressed her such a big charges: 'Inspire to subvert the state power'. Xu Zhiyong put the article on a website and built a personal blog for Xu Zhiyong. What sin do you say? Did you (Beijing) advertise everywhere that you have freedom of speech? How can others put things on the website and send it? What about subverting the state power? It is nothing more than because he is Xu Zhiyong's girlfriend. "</p>

<p>** Li Qiaochu was degraded by the worsening of depression, and the family members were repeatedly applied for bail pending trial.</p>
<p>Since Li Qiaochu has been detained since 2021, Luo Shengchun said that the case was unable to complete the interrogation, and the date of verdict may be delayed. Li Qianchu, who was worried that Li Qianchu, who had long controlled depression by drugs for a long time, would worsen his physical and mental condition. She said that Li Qianchu's mother had applied for bail pending trial many times, but was rejected.</p>
<p>Luo Shengchun: "After she entered the detention center, she could not control the condition without taking medicine. There were phantoms and hallucinations, so she had been taking medicine for depression. This psychotherapy had certain side effects. There are all kinds of harm. Her mother has written an application for bail pending trials for ten times, hoping to let her come out to adopt disease, but it will not work. The reason for rejection can not prevent social harm. Considering her physical condition, if it is leader, if it is leading If she is willing to bow her head, her lawyer will cooperate with the order of walking, but the leadership is unwilling to plead guilty, so she must be guilty. "</p>
<p><strong> Human rights lawyer: A number of arranges in the court of Li Qiaochu's case belonging to illegal workers are revenge due to refusal to cooperate. </strong></p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng, a human rights lawyer who concerned about the progress of the case, said that according to her understanding, the day Li Qiaochu opened the trial of the case, and the arranges of the court's representative lawyers were illegal. Wang Qingpeng praised the two representatives of the lawyers to fight bravely under high pressure.</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng: "Lawyer Li Guobei has agreed to check the public documents, but the court also searched the lawyer Li Guobei. This is not only the court's criminal illegal law, but also a serious insult to the female lawyer. Seeing testimony, excluding illegal evidence, etc., these laws stipulate that the court does not support it. Yu Kai temporarily lifts the commission relationship with the parties in the court. These two lawyers have violated the law of fighting lawyers in the case of defense lawyers in China. It has more significant significance than entering the court. The practice of the two lawyers will definitely be retaliated by the authorities and admire their struggles. "</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng estimates that the authorities will ask Li Qiaochu to entrust a new defense lawyer within 15 days. If they cannot be entrusted, the court may designate official lawyers and forcibly the hearing.</p>
<p><strong> Comments: The CCP uses its asks to drive away the lawyers hired by the family members to let the officials send lawyers involved </strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiangang, a Chinese human rights lawyer, also believes that the struggle between the two lawyers defending the rights and interests of the parties and the dignity of the lawyer is even more valuable in today's environment. He also agreed with Wang Qingpeng's statement. I believe that after the incident, Li Qiaochu is even more difficult to find an agent lawyer. In the end, the case turned into a lawyer.</p>
<p>Chen Jiangang: "The least lack of the CCP is the case of injustice. The goal of the court is to drive away all the lawyers hired by the family members. Now they see that the two defender has been driven away. Some friends want to hire a lawyer for Li Qiaochu, but this is not this. What is the significance, because the era of criminal defense has passed, and then ask the lawyer's court to not let you meet, as well as various suppression and threats. The lawyer dare not speak or even drive away. Arrange a lawyer for the defendant Li Qiaochu, and send her to prison under the joint force of the Public Security Bureau, the Procuratorate, the Court, the Public Security, and the officials of the officials. "</p>
<p>Wang Qingpeng and Chen Jiangang said that Li Qiaochu's case may be delayed and tried because of the need to take the procedure again. In the harsh environment, she was worried that she would be more unfavorable to her mental condition.</p>

<p>The Oujili Astronomical Telescope was originally planned to be launched by the Russian Soyuz rocket. However, Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, was sanctioned by Western countries, and then withdrew the launch system.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T06-23-17/1-1687414177.png" />On April 19, a court sketch showed that Jack Tiela (second from right), a member of the National Air Force National Guard, appeared in a hearing in Boston, Massachusetts (Associated Press) shortly after his arrest (the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Jack Tiera, a member of the National Air Force National Guard, was suspected of leaking national security confidential documents on social media, and had filed a non -guilty defense against federal felony.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 21 -year -old Jack Tiela appeared in the federal court in Worust, Massachusetts. A few days ago, he was charged with six jurisdictions that deliberately reserved and transmitted confidential information related to defense -related confidential information.</p>
<p>When the judge read out his allegations, Tiera stood next to his lawyer wearing an orange prison uniform and replied, "Master Judge, I am not guilty." The trial date has not been determined.</p>
<p>Tesyra was accused of posting photos and transcription copies of sensitive materials on the Social Media Forum Discord, leaking national security information related to the Ukraine War and other military interests.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T06-23-17/1-1687414645.jpg" />The leaked Pentagon document tells us what information about the Ukrainian war?</p>
<p>After the secret documents were leaked and Tesyra was arrested in April, the Bayeng government was anxious to guarantee to the allies that the United States was capable of protecting its national security secrets.</p>
<p>Tesbera was detained in the federal prison in Plymouth County, southern Boston during the trial. A judge rejected the request to re -consider the suspect's detention order by the defense lawyer.</p>
<p>His family said in a statement on Wednesday, "What is important is that Jack will now spend his day in court," and added, "We hope Jack can get the fair and fair treatment he deserves."</p>
<p>Investigators believe that the young man is an online chat room owner called "Thug Shakercentral" on the social media platform Discord. Members share jokes here, their favorite types of guns, and their views on international conflicts.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice also stated that Teeira had a history of disturbing comments on the Internet. For example, in November, he posted that he hoped to see a large number of people being killed in the "massacre".</p>
<p>The authorities said that Tesyra, as a certain military IT expert, shared military secrets with the organization since January.</p>
<p>Some people have questioned how the government awarded the safe status of personnel -and why Tiera could come into contact with such confidential documents, and the memo submitted to the court showed that Teeira has been reprimanded many times for handling improperly or improperly viewing confidential materials.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-22T06-23-17/1-1687414720.jpg" />A man suspected of leaking the Pentagon was prosecuted according to the "Spy Law"</p>
<p>US Minister of Justice Merrick Galan said in a statement issued last week that Terra has obtained information about "if sharing, and it is expected to cause abnormal damage to national security."</p>
<p>Terra faced a maximum of 10 years in prison, which means that he may face a maximum prison of 60 years.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has always been keen to investigate those who share national security secrets, even if they are considered public values or exposed the government's illegal behavior.</p>

<h1>The sea is shocked 84 hours of lucky rescue British men: the submersible loss is terrible</h1>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, London, 21st) A tourist submersible for exploring the wreckage of the well -known shipwreck "Titanic" disappeared in the North Atlantic, and five passengers lived and died. A British man who had been trapped for more than 3 days recalled the nightmare and shouted "very terrible".</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-22T06-32-17-00-00/000000.png" />In 1973, a small submersible by Roger Mallinson and Rogerchapman was trapped in the 480 -meter -deep section of the sea outside Irish. Fortunately, they were fortunate to be rescued before the oxygen consumption. This is the deepest deep -sea rescue operation in history.</p>
<p>When 85 -year -old Marinsen talked about the five passengers on the "Titanic" submersible, he said, "This sounds very and very dangerous, and I feel very scared for them."</p>
<p>He told reporters: "If they are waiting for rescue, I think that every passenger will enter a area and make as much noise as much as possible."</p>
<p>"I can't understand why these people are abandoned in the Atlantic in Lake districts in Lake districts, and said it is unreasonable."</p>
<p>The underwater sound was suspected of detecting the "collision sound" today, which means that there is a hint of hope for the rescue of life to inspire the search and rescue personnel; this is a race with time, because the remaining oxygen in the submersible is not much.</p>
<p>Marlinson recalled that he was pessimistic when he experienced the suffering. He said: "The pressure is very high, very cold, you must try to keep warm, you don't want to consume oxygen."</p>

<p>Marinsen said that after a group of alert dolphins left, he was relieved until the door opened.</p>
<p>"When the dolphin disappears, they realize that they are safe. They have been around us for 84 hours. Thousands of dolphins take care of us here. They know that we are in trouble."</p>
<p>He said, "You can't talk to the ground through the underwater telephone, because whenever you speak, thousands of dolphins will make a chatter."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) Chinese e -commerce leader Alibaba announced this week that Taiwanese Cai Chongxin, a Taiwanese, who is also the owner of the New York Net Team, will take over its huge career territory and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/阿里巴巴将换帅-马云再有高论/a-65980411">and serve as the director of Alibaba Long position</a>This is considered to be an important measure of Alibaba who managed to save the situation to reverse the slow growth and reorganization of business.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Cai Chongxin, the current executive vice chairman of Alibaba, will take over the chairman of the chairman in September. The current chairman and chief executive officer Zhang Yong will step down and lead the cloud intelligent department that the group spin -off. Cai Chongxin is one of Alibaba's largest personal shareholders and owns 1.4%of the issued shares of the company.</p>
<p>In addition, Cai Chongxin is a supporter and investor in blockchain technology. Therefore, his new role will push cryptocurrencies to the top of Alibaba's e -commerce business and may pave the way for payment innovation.</p>
<p>After the reorganization is completed, Cai Chongxin will take charge of Alibaba's diversified interest holding companies, as well as retaining e -commerce business control to the company's core business entities, including Taobao and Tmall.</p>
<h3>Unique Taiwan and American background</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T07-20-00Z/65663018_401.jpg" />The Chinese e -commerce market is facing fierce competition. The picture shows a female consumer in Zhejiang in 2019 using Alipay's face recognition technology (data photo)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Cai Chongxin was born in Taiwan and graduated from Yale University in the United States. He has served as a lawyer and private equity investor. He co -founded Alibaba with Ma Yun in 1999, served as the chief financial officer, and was promoted to the executive vice chairman in 2013.</p>
<p>In addition to Taiwan's background, Cai Chongxin has a passport in Hong Kong and Canada at the same time. Although he was criticized in the United States for some controversial issues because of supporting Beijing's position, Cai Chongxin's close connection with the United States was not common among Chinese business leaders today.</p>
<p>In 2018, he purchased the equity of the US NBA Nets. In addition, he also controlled the American Professional Hockey Team: San Diego SEA, and the American professional women's basketball team: New York Liberal Team.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" reported that Zhang Yi, chief executive officer of Guangzhou Ai Media Consulting, said, "Alibaba is likely to transform into a financial holding company, just like the direction adopted by many large consortia in the past."</p>
<p>"Cai Chongxin's main career is related to finance and strategic investment, so his ability and experience are very suitable for the new stage," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<h3>Alibaba grows slowly</h3>
<p>"Wall Street Journal" reported, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/避免中國監管打壓-螞蟻金服脫鉤阿里巴巴/a-62214059">Alibaba's reorganization and coach</a>It has made the company more flexible for many years. As China's economic growth has slowed down, and competition from e -commerce platforms such as Pinduoduo and Douyin has intensified, Alibaba is now developing slowly.</p>
<p>Alibaba's market value reached its peak at the end of 2020, exceeding $ 850 billion, but before the leadership was announced, the market value had dropped to about $ 238 billion. In addition, Alibaba's income growth rate has grown slowly in the first quarter of this year, which is one of the lowest levels since the company was listed in 2014.</p>
<p>Alibaba's diversified business will be divided into 6 major doors, namely: cloud computing, Chinese e -commerce, global e -commerce, digital maps and take -out, logistics, and media and entertainment departments.</p>
<p>This reorganization can also keep Alibaba founder Ma Yun's actual influence on the company. Because most of the year before the plan was announced, Ma Yun personally planned the reorganization of the e -commerce empire abroad.</p>
<p>According to people familiar with the matter, last month, Ma Yun met with the executives of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce of Alibaba to discuss the increasingly fierce competition of the company. People familiar with the matter said that he urged the department to revise its business strategy and governance and said that Alibaba's successful strategy may not be applicable.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T07-20-00Z/64312741_401.jpeg" />Alibaba founder Ma Yun attended an event in Hong Kong in 2016 (data photo)</p>
<h3>Analysts look at the reorganization: the correct approach is correct</h3>
<p>Tim Culpan, a Bloomberg columnist, believes that investors will face a choice in any department of the 6 departments under Alibaba Group: to pursue profit or growth rate. As far as the current situation is concerned, none of these six departments have a way to provide these two goals at the same time.</p>
<p>Karpan believes that Cai Chongxin's helm should help stabilize the ship of Alibaba Group. With each of Alibaba's split departments operating independently, the parent company will do much less than in the past.</p>
<p>"Wall Street Journal" reported that Chinese investment institutions "86Research" (86research) focused on Charliechai, an analyst of the technology industry, believes that this reorganization shows that Ma Yun is returning to Alibaba and "exercise more directly to control more direct control. right".</p>
<p>Ling Weisen, a senior consultant to Asian Technology Stocks, said that Cai Chongxin's appointment should be favored by investors, but it is unlikely to improve Alibaba's stock price. Because Alibaba's recent stock price is mainly due to geopolitical influence and concerns about the Chinese economy, not the management of Alibaba's management.</p>

The investigation of the "Return Series" will be asked if it is officially proud of whether it is officially returned in 1997. In response to the "cross -strait issue", it includes the support score of Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>The sightseeing submersible "Titan" lost contact for many days that caused people's concerns about their safety. A famous saying of the founder of the shipowner company: "Said safety is pure time" and then triggers people's discussion.</p>
<p>Titan (Titan), a submersible for adventure traveling with five people to Titanic Shipbuilding site for adventure tourism, [June 18) <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230620-1406292">Missing in the waters of eastern Canada</a>Essence "Titan" can dive 4,000 meters underwater. It is owned by the US private submarine exploration company Oceangateexpenditions and can carry up to five people. The oxygen of the submersible is expected to be exhausted on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>"Titan" is 22 feet long (6.7 meters). According to the company's website, it dived to 4,000 meters in December 2018 and sneaked to the Titani shipwreck site with a depth of about 3800 meters in 2021. This year plans to carry out 18 such diving this year.</p>
<h4>Former employee had expressed concern about the submersible design</h4>
<p>Reuters reports that some experts are worried about their safety. A former employee and a member of a trading group have expressed concern about the design of the submersible. On January 18, 2018, DavidLochridge, the employee of the Marine Gate, forwarded a project report to the company's leaders to criticize the "Titan" research and development process. He was particularly worried about the design of the hull and his strong pressure on deep water. Ability.</p>
<p>Rockridge and the gate of the Ocean filed a lawsuit. According to the lawsuit documents, the company held a meeting the next day to discuss Rockridge's concerns. At the end of the meeting, Rockridge said that he could not accept the company's design decision and would not authorize any manned sailing without further testing. Subsequently, the company fired him.</p>
<p>Stocktonrush, founder and executive officer headquartered in Everdon, Washington, Washington, also on the Titan. Bloomberg quoted his famous saying, "Saying safety is purely a waste of time" reported that Lash said in a podcast show last year to the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation reporter Davidpogue: "I mean, if you just want safety, Then don't get out of bed, don't get in the car, don't do anything. At some time, you will always bear some risks. This is really a risk return issue. "</p>
<p>Sakers such as the Titan are mainly used to explore some of the rare places on the planet. They are almost free of supervision, so they will clearly inform passengers that the fatal risks may be faced after boarding the ship.</p>
<p>Born in the UK, Robmccallum, who visited the Titanic shipwreck, was visited. According to Bloomberg 2017, McCarem had served as a consultant to the gate of the ocean in the early years, but later worried that Rush was worried about Rush. Different reasons are separated from the company.</p>
<h4>Passengers need to sign a security exemption statement before boarding the submersible</h4>
<p>According to passengers of the submersible, they need to sign a security exemption statement before the submersible. Last summer, Mikereiss, the producer of the TV show "Titan", told the New York Post: "The first page of" Death "mentioned three times."</p>
<p>Some people question why the representatives of the marine gate have notified the United States Coast Guard for a long time after losing contact with the Titan. The submersible at 9:45 am in New York (9:45 pm in Singapore time), that is, after one hour and 45 minutes of diving, they lost contact with the mother ship, but the company told the Coast Guard until 5:40 pm to inform the Coast Guard. Essence</p>
<p>A possible explanation is that the "Titan" is not for the first time to lose contact with the water surface after sneaking into the sea for a long time. Pogg said in a tweet this week that he had lost contact with the water surface for five hours when he was sitting in the submarine last time.</p>

<h3>"Titan" submersible loss: How much risks to explore the wreckage of the Titanic?</h3>

<p>9:01 am on June 22, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/_130168095_9a4a0d16-c639-4aee-a051-4423d8b5e620.jpg"></a>Image source, getty images</p>
<p><strong> Pay carrier tourists who go to the Titanic (TMSTITANIC, Titanic) wreckage disappear soon after departure on Sunday (June 18). The amount of oxygen will be exhausted on Thursday; the US Coast Guard claims to detect the sound of underwater knocks twice, but the trace of the submersible is not yet there are clues. In this article, we will discuss how dangerous is the sea area around the Titanic wreckage that has been sinking for more than 100 years. </strong></p>
<p>At some time in the autumn of 1911, a huge ice cubes on the vast glacier in the southwest of Greenland broke off. In the next few months, it slowly drifted south, and gradually melted under the driving of foreign flow and wind.</p>
<p>Then, on April 14, 1912, the cold night that could not be seen in the moonlight, a 125 -meter -long iceberg -is the remaining part of the 500 -meter ice cubes from the Greenland fjord a year ago -hit the south The Titanic, the passenger ship of Andle to New York, USA. In less than three hours, the ships on the way of the Virgin Airlines sank, and more than 1,500 passengers and ship groups were killed. The wreckage of the boat is now located at nearly 3.8 kilometers deep under the sea about 640 kilometers southeast of Newfoundland's coast.</p>
<p>Until now, the iceberg is still a threat to the ship's transportation -in 2019, 1515 icebergs floated south from March to August to the shipping routes across the Greater Ocean. However, the final restaurant of Titanic also has danger in itself, which makes it a huge challenge to visit the wreckage of the most famous crash in the world in this world.</p>
<p>As a five -person submersible carrying a paid passenger disappeared on the way to the Titanic wreckage, the BBC also discussed the situation of the underwater area.</p>
<h3>Sneak in Deep Sea</h3>
<p>(https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/science-65982371/p0fwcwbv/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/p0fwcwlq.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Tourism submersible goes to visit the Titanic shipwreck wreckage on the way to the wreckage of the shipwreck</p>
<p>The depths of the ocean are dark. The sun was quickly absorbed by the water. After about 1,000 meters below the water, it was difficult to penetrate how far. Under this, the ocean is a permanent darkness. The area of Titanic's resting interest is also known as the "midnight area", which is also the reason.</p>
<p>In the past, it was also talked about in the exploration of this wreckage. It continued to decrease more than two hours in the completely dark, and then the sea bed suddenly appeared under the light of the submersible.</p>
<p>Views are limited to a few meters long that can be shown on the tank -sized submersible. Stepping on this depth is a very difficult task, so that it is easy to lose the direction on the sea bed.</p>
<p>However, after decades of high -precision scanning combination, the Titanic wreckage map can provide a reference point when an object enters the sight. Son also allows crew to detect small terrain and objects other than a small range of submersible lighting.</p>
<p>The divers of the submersible also rely on a technology called inertial navigation, using a set of acceleration meters and gyroscopes to determine their position and direction at the known starting point and speed. The Titan submersible of Oceangate is equipped with the most advanced self -inertial navigation system, which is combined with an acoustic sensor called Doppler tester to estimate the submersible and the sea bed The relative depth and speed between the between.</p>
<p>Even so, the passengers who participated in the Titanic Journey of the Ocean Corporation in the past still mentioned how difficult it was to find the direction after arriving at the bottom of the sea. Mikereiss is a TV comedy screenwriter who participated in the Titanic trip to the gate of the Ocean last year. He told BBC: "When you reach the bottom of the sea, you don't know where you are. We have to go blindly on the bottom of the sea. We only know that the Titanic is in the nearby area, but there is a dark one there, and the largest object sinking on the bottom of the sea will be Except for 500 yards, and we spent 90 minutes to find it. "</p>
<h3>Deep sea high pressure</h3>
<p>The deeper a object dives on the bottom, the larger the surrounding water pressure. On the bottom of the 3800 -meter underwater, everything around the Titanic and its surroundings bears the pressure of about 40 MPa, which is 390 times the pressure on the ground.</p>
<p>"From another perspective, it is about 200 times the air pressure in the car tire," "The marine researcher at Stockholm ResillenceCentre of Stockholm Resillence Stockholm Resilles, Sweden, and Robert Blasiak, Radio4 (Radio4),") " In an interview with the TODAY column, "This is why you need a very thick submersible in the outer wall."</p>
<p>The carbon fiber and titanium outer wall design of the Titan submersible to make its maximum operation depth of 4,000 meters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/_130167120_908abe8b-f47b-4f2d-9e8c-9d933975673c.jpg" />Image source, PA Media</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The thick outer wall of the submersible can undergo the person in the protective cabin under the superwater pressure.</p>
<h3>Underwater flow</h3>
<p>We may be more familiar with the powerful sea flow that can be able to bring the vessels and swimmers, but there are fierce underwater flow in the deep sea. Although it is usually not as strong as the ocean flow on the sea, it is still a large amount of water flowing. They may drive the water layer below from the wind on the sea, which may be the different tide of the deep sea or the water density difference caused by temperature and salinity. The rare phenomenon called "underwater storm" -usually related to the vortex of the sea surface -may also cause strong intermittent water flow to sweep the material on the sea bed.</p>
<p>When the Titanic sinks, the head of the ship and the stern broke, forming two main parts. The well -known information about its surrounding water comes from the study of the texture of the seabed texture and the squid around the wreckage.The sand wave pattern formed on the east side of the wreckage of the Titanic — the parts of the items, accessories, fixed pieces, coal and ships itself spread after the ship sink -indicate that there is a kind of ocean flow from east to west, but in the Lord in the Lord In the location of the wreckage, scientists said that the current flows from northwest to southwest, which may be because most of the wreckage changes the direction of the water flow.</p>
<p>Around the south side of the ship's head, the flow of water seems to be changing, from northeast to northwest to southwest.</p>
<p>Many experts predict that the precipitation brought by the current water eventually buried the wreckage of the Titanic under the sediment.</p>
<p>The deep -sea examination scientist Gerhardseiffrt recently led a sailing to conduct a high -precision scan on the Titanic wreckage. He told the BBC that he did not believe that the water flow in the area would be threatened to threaten the submersible -as long as the submersible was electric.</p>
<p>"I don't know if there is water that will be enough to pose a threat to any normal deep -sea vehicles at the Titanic wreckage scene," he said. Threat security. "</p>
<h3>The wreck itself</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-22T09-01-27.000Z/_130167116_918b6c27-cb1d-4801-9846-979d86da7cbc.jpg" />Image source, PA Media</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Due to the water pressure, sediments movement, and microorganisms that eaten iron as the bottom of the sea, the Titanic is actually slowly disintegrating</p>
<p>After more than 100 years of sinking on the sea, the Titanic has gradually degraded. The impact caused by the two main parts of the hull in the initial collision with the sea, which caused the large wreckage to be distorted. Over time, the microorganisms with iron as the eclipse formed an ice -column -like "rust column", which accelerated the erosion of the wreckage. In fact, scientists estimate that higher bacterial activities on the stern -are mainly due to the greater damage it suffered — resulting in its erosion speed faster than the bow of the bow.</p>
<p>"The wreckage is constantly collapsed, mainly due to corrosion," Safeter said, "a little bit every year. But as long as you keep a safe distance -without direct contact, without opening from the opening -there will be no damage. "</p>
<h3>Drifting deposits</h3>
<p>Although the possibility of occurring is extremely low, the sedimentation of the sediment in the sea bed suddenly surged, and it has been proven to be damaged or even flushed away from the bottom of the sea in the past.</p>
<p>The biggest similar event -such as an incident that was broken by the cross -Gatai Ocean cable near the coast of Newfoundland in 1929 -it was caused by a strong shock such as earthquakes. People are increasingly aware of the risks of this phenomenon, but there is no sign that the disappearance of the Titan submersible is related to this kind of situation.</p>
<p>Over the years, researchers have discovered signs that the surrounding sea bed at the Titanic shipwreck has suffered a huge underwater and landslide shocks a long time ago. The huge amount of sediment seems to be sliding down along the mainland of New Finland, forming the "unstable corridor" called by scientists. They estimate that the last "deconstruction" incident occurred tens of thousands of years ago and formed a sediment layer of up to 100 meters (328 feet). However, many years of research on the Canadian Geological Survey (GeologicalSurvey of Canada) marine geological scientist DavidPiper, the sea bed, said such an incident is extremely rare. He compared this kind of incident to the outbreak of Vesuwei's volcano or Mount Fuji, and the frequency of occurrence may be every tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a phenomenon called Turbidity Current -sea water carrying a large amount of sediments flowing along the land -slope -this event will be more common and can be caused by storms. "We have a duplicate interval for about 500 years," Paper said. However, the terrain of the sea bed in the area is likely to lead any deposition logistics to a "Titanic Valley", which means that it will not reach the wreckage of the shipwreck at all.</p>
<p>Both Severt and Pipper said that this type of incident is unlikely to be a factor in the missing of Titan submersibles.</p>
<p>There are other terrain around the wreckage of shipwrecks to be explored. In the previous expeditions of Ocean Gate and the Titan submersible, Paul-Henrynargeolet, a former French navy diver and a submersible driver, detected a mysterious Sennar signal in 1996. In the end, it was discovered that it was a rock reef covered by marine life. During the recent exist, he hoped to reach another signal not far from the Titanic shipwreck.</p>
<p>Although the action of looking for a missing submersible is still continuing, it is still clueless for Titan and its crew members. In such a difficult and harsh environment, considering the risk of going to the Titanic shipwreck, it is still the same as when the first group of people arrived in the deep sea in 1986 to see the shipwreck.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-22T09-02-09-00-00/000000.png" />A spokesman for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) told AFP today that the related facilities of UPSide Foods and Good Meat have obtained the food safety system permit, and the two companies will recently supply products to several restaurants.</p>
<p>UPSIDE FOODS and Good Meat have obtained security permits of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November last year. The US Department of Agriculture reviewed and approved its product label last week to ensure that it is not misleading.</p>
<p>The founder and CEO of Apsai Foods, UMA Valeti, stated that: "This approval will fundamentally change how the meat products are sent to our table."</p>
<p>He said: "This is a big step towards the future of sustainable future, a future that retains choice and life."</p>
<p>Joshtemtrick, chief CEO of the Food Business of the American New Corporation Eat Just, said its "cultivation of meat" is now "provided to the public in the world's largest economies."</p>
<p>Some start -ups aim at the production of so -called laboratory cultivation to make humans eat animal protein without causing relevant environmental damage or animal suffering.</p>
<p>This kind of product is different from plant alternatives such as soybeans. Botanical substitutes imitate the texture and taste of meat, but do not contain any animal protein.</p>
<p>Eat Just was approved by Singapore in 2020 and became the first company that was approved to produce artificial meat.</p>
<p>Non -profit organization Farm Forward investigated 200 US adults last year and found that 2/3 respondents said that they would eat artificial meat products.</p>

Agreement and an official protocol. "</p>
<p>Mao Ning said: "The so -called 'initiative' is just the guise of the United States under the guise of economic and trade cooperation.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美21世紀貿易倡議被敲骨吸髓還是經貿轉骨/a-65865069); In order to conspire 'independence' private interests, the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party authorities sell the vital interests of Taiwanese compatriots and enterprises, and the "vitality of the name of Taiwan 'and" selling Taiwan'; illustration](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美贸易倡议签署协定-中国批美掏空一中原则/a-65803608)"</p>

Cases that have been harassed and sexually assaulted across the industry, party, gender, and involving issues such as minors, sneak shots, and poisoning. The "#Metoo" movement also appeared many years ago in mainland China. As a Chinese society, what is the difference between the two sides of the relevant incidents on both sides?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/hcm1-06042023114630.html"><strong> Taiwan set off #Metoo boom Wang Dan and blue -green politicians are all controlled by sexual harassment </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/jt-03062023131230.html">"Love Life, Unwilling Fate" Chinese new women enter the international equal rights movement</a></strong></p>
<p>The sexual harassment storm in Taiwan "#Metoo" is like snowballs. In the past month, accusations have been constantly exploded from the political circle, media circle, performing arts circle, literary circles, academic, medical circles, and legal circles. , Resign and notice. The outside world believes that at the end of April this year, the Taiwanese drama "Candidates -Creator", which was launched in Netflix at the end of April this year, encouraged the courage of the victims.</p>
<p>The writer Shangguan, a writer married to Taiwan, has gone through the "#Metoo" trend on both sides of the strait. The difference is broken in a word: "Taiwan Metoo started from politics, and Chinese Metoo intercepted it in politics. Carefully bypassed politics, and the related voices came out. Finally, the sound of the entire Metoo's Metoo was blocked into a sensitive word, and everyone could not search and pay attention. "</p>
<p>China Weibo recently has the key word "#Metoo", "lifting the ban", but the content is related to the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party candidates and Taiwan entertainers.</p>
<p>Shangguan chaos mentioned that the China #Metoo Movement was extended from public welfare, cultural, academic circles to the media and religious circles around 2018. Tennis famous Peng Shuai accused Zhang Gaoli, then Vice Premier of the State Council, and barely involved political events. But in China, victims often "disappear" after breaking news.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T10-55-00-04-00/000002.png" />Chinese tennis celebrity Peng Shuai (Associated Press Picture) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hx-06222023101754.html/2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T10-55-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Where is Peng Shuai and Huang Xueqin? Reporters, reporters or disappearances are arrested </strong></p>
<p>Shangguan randomly said, Huang Xueqin, a female reporter reported by Metoo News. At that time, many schools asked her to give a speech. However, after she participated in and recorded the Hong Kong -CUHK parade, she was caught by inciting the crime of subverting the regime, and there was no news yet.</p>
<p>"This is the difference between democracy and authoritarian systems." Shangguan chaos said that in mainland China, not only can not review the political circle, but it will not become an incident of establishing an institutional framework at all. Flowing to everyone's emotions. As soon as the wind sounds, what to do and what to do is limited; gender awareness will not rise, let alone institutional reform or give women more protection.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T10-55-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chinese independent reporter Huang Xueqin won 2022 Valeis Annan Berg Female Reporter Award (Huang Xueqin &amp; Wang Jianbing followed Facebook picture) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hx-06222023101754.html/3.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T10-55-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a>Shangguan said in a mess: "The opposite of Taiwan has exploded for a few days, and Lai Qingde and Tsai Ing -wen immediately issued a lot of institutional order. For example, where there is a loophole in sexual education, the place where the implementation level needs to be echo is very different; Relevant political figures show their responsibility with a retreat and resignation. In China, it is impossible for any official to step down because of Metoo. Taiwan's political circles, especially the DPP, will come to this day with the human rights party. Courage, your own introspection must be the highest, and you must not use the Kuomintang and the people to say three or four. "</p>
<p>The Taiwan feminist sports scholar Cheng Lingfang was interviewed by Radio Free Asia. It also mentioned that the most important revelation of the "#METOO" movement was "uneven power", which was suppressed in the past and is now seen.</p>
<p><strong> Metoo </strong> <strong> Revelation is not equal to power </strong> <strong><em>* </em>* How can the two sides of the strait be placed? </strong></p>
<p>Cheng Lingfang said: "China's power relationship is closely linked, the power structure is too tight, most people have no way to speak, and gender sportsmen will be under great pressure. Peng Shuai is already brave because he is a celebr The shelf is disappeared, not optimistic. "</p>
<p>Cheng Ling mentioned that Taiwan ’s Metoo burst into the CEO of legislators proposed for the DPP, and hostile political parties are also optimistic about the show. The Democratic Progressive Party immediately dealt with this issue from the perspective of "zero tolerance", and other political parties realized the importance of this issue.Cheng Ling Fang is not worried about Metoo to become a means. She believes that it is difficult for victims to tell a false story in order to frame others. Because it is difficult to proof, many victims dare not say that the victims of the victims in their lives dare to say that many victims have explored for ten years before they dare to speak, realizing that the social atmosphere has changed or they have the ability.</p>
<p>Cheng Lingfang said: "The victims themselves have to pay a lot of money. In case of breaking the news, they will not be accepted by their own dear family and friends. Speaking of the victims with power, this time is really different. "</p>
<p>Former Democratic Progressive Party legislators and lawyers, a lawyer, who has been put into the Taiwan Women's Movement for more than 30 years, was interviewed by Radio Asia in Liberty, and pointed out that in 1994, there was a wave of METOO campaigns, mainly on campus anti -sexual harassment parades. Several "wolf masters" on campus.</p>
<p><strong> Taiwan's lifting </strong> <strong> Metoo sports </strong> <strong> feminist lawyer: apprentice law is not enough to be on its own </strong></p>
<p>Youmei mentioned that after the women's group promoted the formulation, the Legislative Yuan, by infringing the autonomy of people's autonomy in public places, the "sexual harassment prevention and control law", "sexual assault of criminal prevention and control law", for the "Gender Equal Law" in the workplace, the "gender equality of gender equality on campus" in the workplace The Education Law, in the criminal law, has also established an unsatisfactory seal of sexual independent, and has been legislative in the past three decades. Thirty years have passed, and the second wave of METOO explosions, many problems that happened in the workplace obviously are not enough to be on their own. Although there are legal systems and appeal processes, the entire atmosphere and culture have not changed, and the victims still dare not appeal. This time, it is a problem at the entire cultural level.</p>
<p>Youmei said: "The relics of culture are that in the past, the so -called male and female humble, women were objectized, materialized, and commercialized. Speaking of NO is NO, you should stop. Speaking itself is also healing, on the one hand, it is also teaching: I am a victim. Why do I have to review my fault and apologize to the victim? "</p>
<p>You Mei emphasized that when a woman's issue is ignored, it becomes a national security issue. This time, many people have fallen off and withdrawn from election. Treating each other and real human rights between each other and real human rights. I think this is a good moment of reflection. Everyone's body can only be controlled by themselves, and no one has the right to touch others. As long as people are uncomfortable, they are mainly based on the feelings of the victims and return to the interpretation of people and people. "</p>
<p>You Mei said that the two waves of METOO campaigns in Taiwan established a system from bottom to top. This second wave of Metoo is a big explosion before Taiwan's move to the human rights movement: "This time, so many people came out and saw that no one dared to suppress it or turn a blind eye. This time, everyone was seriously serious. To deal with land. The democratic system must attach importance to the voice of the people; under the political political politics, the people's voice is immediately suppressed. This is the biggest difference between the two sides of the strait. "</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66001425/65863520"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T11-04-00Z/65863520_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany) EU member states formulated the 11th round of sanctions on Russia. Among them, it is not only for individuals and organizations that support Russia's invasion of the Ukraine War, but also for the behavior of bypassing sanctions so far. The EU Council's rotating chairman of Sweden announced the news in Brussels on Wednesday (June 21).</p>
<p>The permanent representatives of the EU's 27 member states reached an agreement. The written procedures will be officially completed before Friday.</p>
<p>Sanctions include that they are prohibited from exporting specific products to some third countries due to the suspected bypassing sanctions. EU member states have banned many products from being transported to Russia for several months.</p>
<p>The country that bypass the sanctions against Russia is considered to be Kazakhstan, Armenia, the UAE and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国对俄罗斯银行实施限制/a-65991127">China</a>wait. EU experts assessed that Turkey was relatively resolutely responding to clues that bypassed sanctions.</p>
<p>In addition, according to EU diplomats, the existing transit ban was strengthened in the new sanctions. The specific high -tech products or aircraft parts used in the national defense field will prohibit from being transported from third countries to Russia.</p>
<p>Similar to previous sanctions, this time also increased the personal list of profits from the Russian aggression war. They were banned from entering the European Union and they would be frozen in the EU property. According to EU diplomats, 71 individuals and 33 organizations are included in the sanctions list. It is said that the initiative also aims to combat illegal hijacking of Ukrainian children to Russia.</p>
<p>Feng Delin, the chairman of the European Commission, welcomed the sanctions. She said that strengthening export restrictions will further crack down on Russian President Putin's war machines. Not long ago, Feng Delin said that in the so far sanctions against Russia, the EU export ban involving about 50 billion euros of goods before the war. This is equivalent to the proportion of 55%. The EU's import ban on Russian products involves about 60%of the imports of the pre -war, worth about 90 billion euros.</p>
<h3>Western sanctions on Russia are useful?</h3>
<h3>Some countries have worried about China countermeasures</h3>
<p>According to Germany, when introducing the suggestions of the sanctions in early May, it has caused a long discussion to criticize individual countries around whether it should be named or not, and Russia bypasses the sanctions through these countries. In particular, some countries express their concerns that if they take action on China, they may trigger countermeasures and have a negative impact on trade relations. Therefore, the final agreement was very cautious.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that the European Commission initially wanted to include Chinese enterprises who wanted to provide military -civilian dual -use products to Russia on the sanctions list. According to diplomats, after Beijing proposed a strong protest, only three Russian companies in Hong Kong were listed in the list.</p>
<p>In late May, Fu Cong, the head of the Chinese EU, said that China did not provide any military equipment to Russia, and exported dual -purpose items were extremely cautious. "Regarding the sanctions related to Chinese companies, I have to emphasize that if the European party cannot get relevant companies to avoid EU sanctions on Russia, we will resolutely countermeasures."</p>
<p>Reuters quoted diplomat news that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705">The draft of the sanctions included eight Chinese companies</a>The EU believes that they sell products to Russia that helps war. The names of these companies were leaked in early May. After the European Commission conducted high -level contact with China, Beijing promised to stop their activities to these companies. As a result, five of them withdrew from the list. The remaining three companies registered in Hong Kong are very small, which may be owned by Russia.</p>
<p>The new sanctions were not obviously launched earlier, first of all due to the objections proposed by Hungary and Greece. According to diplomats, these two EU countries are prevented because Ukraine includes the two countries in the [list of supporting the Russian aggression war] in Ukraine.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国厂商小米被乌克兰列入战争资助者名单/a-65318453)Essence Hungary criticized that the OTP banks involved did not violate any regulations.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia said that the counterattack of Ukraine's military forces has weakened and is re -adjusted at the front line. Russian Defense Minister Sho Gulu said that the Ukraine still has the potential to continue its offensive. In the daily video speech of Ukraine President Zeelianzki on Wednesday evening, he said that the Ukrainian army made progress and advanced forward in the south. However, in an interview with Zessic, a BBC broadcast on Wednesday, he acknowledged that the counterattack offensive was slower than expected. One of the reasons also includes a large area of the Russian army buried landmines.</p>

<p>The United States first approved two companies to sell chickens cultivated in the laboratory with animal cells, which made the United States the second country in the world that allowed animal cells to grow meat after Singapore.</p>
<p>US Department of Agriculture spokesman on Wednesday (June 21) told AFP that the Ministry of Agriculture(USDA)The food safety system of the cell cultivation meat company UPSIDE FOODS and the cell agricultural start -up enterprise Goodmeat. The safety systems of the two companies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in November; the Ministry of Agriculture reviewed and approved their product label last week to ensure that they were not misleading. The two companies said that the product will be provided quickly in a specific restaurant.</p>
<p>UPSIDE FOODS CEO and founder of Umavaleti issued by Umavaleti said: "This approval will fundamentally change the way of putting meat on our dining table ... This is a more sustainable future. A big step. "</p>
<p>Good Meat is a brand of food technology companies EAT Just, and its chief executive officer Josh Titrik(Josh Tetrick)In addition, its "cultivating meat" has now "sold consumers in the world's largest economy."</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, the Singapore Food Bureau approved EAT Just to cultivate chicken for sale in my country, making Singapore the world's first country to sell meat.</p>
<p>It is expensive to produce high -quality meat. However, after being approved, UPSIDE processed the first order from a Michelin -level restaurant from San Francisco. At the same time, GoodMeat also began to produce the first batch of products for a chef.</p>
<p>The meat cultivated in the laboratory is different from the meat alternatives made of plants such as soybeans. The latter imitate the texture and flavor of the meat, but does not contain any animal protein.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-44-00-04-00/000000.png" />Wang Zhen, former vice chairman of China <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/xueyumantan/wlx-06222023090723.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-44-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Baidu Encyclopedia screenshot(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/xueyumantan/wlx-06222023090723.html/@@stream)The evening before I left Urumqi, I went to the Uighur District of Erdaoqiao. There is no special purpose, but I rarely see Uighurs all the way in the northern Xinjiang. It seems that it does not seem to be in Xinjiang. I hope to experience the Uyghur atmosphere again.</p>
<p>The tall buildings in Urumqi have continued to increase. In the past, the Uighur people complained that the high -rise buildings were covered in the Han area. The Uighur District could not see the change, but now it cannot be said. In recent years, the office buildings and apartment buildings in the Uighur are also built. The original alleys have been demolished, and there are only few relics. The newly covered apartment has a Uyghur color. The higher building is used by banks and agencies. The Uighur District formed in history is in the golden location of Urumqi today. Real estate development is playing the idea of this location. Under the name of helping the Uighurs to improve the living conditions, the original bungalow buildings are removed and residents are concentrated in the apartment building. The empty land can be appreciated a lot.</p>
<p>On the road, there were gun policemen and armed police queue patrols. The police are the Uighur and the armed police are Han. The Uighur police exaggerated the gun in front, the muzzle facing down, making the shooting at any time. This has never been seen in other cities. The Han Armed Police did not hold a gun, but only took an electric baton. The villain in the image is also a way to make the Uighur police.</p>
<p>When I observed the police, I saw them suddenly surrounded a few Uighur youths, followed a set of training procedures, and forced several young people to the wall. The Han Armed Police also surrounded the procedures into semi -circular, facing the streets to guard against other directions. The Uighur police questioned the surrounding youth in the semicircular. A fear of the atmosphere suddenly permeated in the air. The Uyghur people who dared to stop and watched, they turned back while walking. Perhaps the police are for this purpose -creating a terrorist atmosphere to form a deterrent. After several young people were questioned, they must be released without finding any problems. The young people's faces were full of warehouse, and they left in a hurry.</p>
<p>The central square of the International Bazaar was opened as a place to eat a buffet to watch the song and dance performance, and it was surrounded by iron fences. The fence is full of dining tables. Each person must pay 218 yuan. Hundreds of people are waiting for the performance while entering the meal. I took a closer look. Except for a few foreign tourists and individual Uighur tour guides, I was basically Han. More Han people are still entering the scene. Outside the fence, the local ethnic minorities were waiting to watch the singing and dance performances. They looked at the fence and looked in from the air. The effect was poor and the posture was uncomfortable, but they didn't need to spend money. I stood with the Uighurs outside the fence. A woman holds the boy as much as possible so that the boy can see it. This scene is weird and sad. Locals watching the singing and dancing of this nation can only stand in this position and in this way.</p>
<p>At the gate of the fence, the ethnic minority girls wore the costumes representing various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The Han people who welcomed the buying tickets entered the venue, and the smiley faces were greeted. Only the back of the nation's compatriots, although she was expressionless. At that time, I remembered another back of the same grace, and it was a behavioral art made by an artist: on the top of a hill near Urumqi, a Uyghur girl wearing national clothing facing the mountains under the mountains And the old houses under the tall buildings that are being demolished and about to be demolished, shouted in Uyghur and Chinese in turn: "The beard is here!Wang Beard is here!" The voice is like weeping blood, the posture is like the heart, Broken, and the world she faced was unprepared.</p>
<p>Wang Huzi refers to Wang Zhen — the leader of the Chinese Communist Party operating the northwest. He is known as a brutal slaughter of the Uyghur and was regarded by the Uyghur as a demon. It is said that when the Uyghur child cried, the mother said, "The beard is coming", and the child will stop crying immediately. Behavioral artistic power is expressed in the new era of the king's beard -capital, market, red dust and the world of drunken dreams, and sweeping Xinjiang under the opening of power and asylum. Roll the old Uyghur house under his feet. The artist wants to express the murderer king beard has been replaced by the king's beard of the new era. The real situation is not replacement, but the two kings beard like a double -sided devil two in one, and in Xinjiang today. The Uyghur is like the Uyghur girl with a beautiful back. She dares to hide on the top of the suburbs and shout helplessly to heaven.</p>

A new crown epidemic that swept the global crown has pushed up the demand for blood, and indirectly accelerated the disappearance. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06222023092540.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000001.png" /></a>(Associated Press)(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06222023092540.html/@@stream)存 is one of the only living fossil species on the earth. It has escaped the five biological extinction, and the extreme natural events did not let it die. The disappearance of the population.</p>
<p><strong> Sad things on the International Nursing Day </strong></p>
<p>In March 2019, Sannuki (also known as Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, and Oriental) was collected into the Red List of Endangered Species by the World Nature Protection Alliance (IUCN), listed as an endangered (EN) grade, and set on June 20th. For "International Conservation Day". Unexpectedly, the new crown virus was born in less than half a year, and the speed of surrounding the world at a speed of thunder was not tangled with this new virus for 4 years.</p>
<p>Has lived on the earth for more than 400 million years, and is older than dinosaurs, and has a horseshoe crab alias because of its appearance. Dr. Yang Mingzhe, a member of the Expert Group of the World Nature Protection Alliance Species Species, pointed out that there are currently 4 types of crickets in the world, including the American 鲎 distributed on the East Coast of North America, and the three thorn, round tails and giant crickets distributed in Asia, Among them, the three thorn is the most widely distributed. From the north of Kyushu in Japan, the west side of Sumatra on the south to Indonesia in the south, the most distributed place is in China, especially in the north Bay of Guangxi.</p>
<p>In the past, East Asia had a lot of traces. More than 30 years ago, the thorny spines can be seen everywhere on the beaches of the eastern and southern parts of China, and now there are only the memories of the older generation. "Asian countries have rewarded the triad -ethnic ethnic groups to show a recession, including Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia." Yang Mingzhe explained that "China has an evaluation data showing that from 2000 to 2020, the 鲎 on the coast of China from 2000 to 2020 The quantity is sharp from about 1 million to about 200,000. "</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, this ancient creature with magical blue blood has silently control human health, "saved all human life." Yang Mingzhe, who has been investing for more than 20 years, said with a emotional tone, " Factor (FACTC), this coagulation factor can detect whether the vaccine has bacterial internal toxins in a few minutes, internal toxins may cause allergies, fever, and even death. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000002.png" />The blue blood of the 能 can accurately detect the internal toxins of the bacteria, and a new coronal virus allows the 鲎 to lose blood. (Associated Press) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06222023092540.html/3.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> A virus accelerates blood loss </strong></p>
<p>Most injection and vaccine must be detected before the factory is out of the factory to ensure that no bacterial pollution is. "Moving a reagent with blood -blooded blood is currently close to the only detection method." Yang Mingzhe further said, "New crown pneumonia explosion in 2020, in mid -2020, teams all over the world are put into vaccine research and development. As the demand of the test agent increases, the demand of the test agent has increased. , Unsurable to accelerate the disappearance speed. "</p>
<p>How much is the great plague of this century? This number is a mystery. However, from March 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the new crown pneumonia is popular in the world. It has reached more than 100 countries. Scientists have developed vaccines at an unprecedented speed. The number of doses (L) has exceeded 13.4 billion, and the degree of "blood loss" is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>There are two types of tadpoles adopted by various countries, one is the LAL pupa reagent extracted by the blood of the Americas, and the other is the TAL 鲎 reagent extracted by the blood of the three spiny sinks. The IUCN red list belongs to the "easy danger" (VU) species, which means that the existing species are about to become an endangered species. The current situation of the three spiny crickets is even more optimistic.</p>
<p>Yang Mingzhe said that most of the current blood blood is provided by the United States and China, and the production and manufacturing of the test agents are also dominated by the United States and China. In China, due to the lack of sources in China, it has invested in the acquisition of three in Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam. Endochoia, even Chinese fishing vessels, caught the border, especially in the waters adjacent to Guangxi and Vietnam, to a certain extent to speed up the decline in the population of other countries.</p>
<p>"In fact, letting 延 continuing is also allowing humans to continue, then it is not to think about it by the country." Yang Mingzhe said, "Some conservation groups believe that the capture of a large number of crickets will cause the number of crickets to decrease sharply. This is also this is also An indisputable fact. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000004.png" />The injection and vaccine must be tested by the reagents to ensure that there is no endotoxin pollution, and the new crown vaccine is no exception. (Agence France -Presse) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/luseqingbaoyuan/grn-06222023092540.html/2.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> After the Chinese slave is reduced to blood slaves </strong></p>
<p>According to the survey estimates of the Ocean Research Institute of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the number of thorns of the three spiny sturgeons in the north Bay of Guangxi has dropped from 600 to 700,000 in the 1990s to about 40,000 pairs in 2019. Essence Yang Mingzhe believes that the development of the coast of Guangxi is not as serious as Guangdong and Fujian, and capturing blood and taking blood is an important reason for a sharp decrease in groups."At least 90%of the blood blood from the blood is from the wild 鲎. Regardless of whether in the United States or China, some units claim to be the puppets cultivated by themselves. I don't think it is a fact. They should be caught from the wild. Perform blood. "Yang Mingzhe explained." At present, the technology of artificial breeding crickets exists, but in terms of cost, the cultivation of a cricket from the ovulation to the adult can be drawn, which may be nearly 10 years. Food, space, electricity bills, etc., the cost of breeding is higher than the field capture. "</p>
<p>Although the reagent companies of various countries emphasize the blood removal, they will put the 鲎 back to the ocean. Yang Mingzhe said that during the blood drawing process, the cricket may have been separated from the sea for too long, the heat shock or hypoxia occurred, or the blood drawing process caused infection and death. In addition, subsequent studies also found that the amount of spawning of the mother -in -law will be greatly reduced, and it will even be easier to get lost, which will affect the effect of survival and reproduction.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000006.png" />In the summer, the three thorns enters the breeding season, and the crickets will become a pair of eggs on the shore, and they often become arrested.

<p>Yang Mingzhe pointed out that the United States stipulates that only one -third of the blood can be drawn, and the death rate after blood drawing is about 10%to 30%. The figures are 15%, although China also has relevant regulations for blood volume, almost all of them have been drawn, and the mortality rate is close to 100%.</p>
<p>This way of rushing to kill is astounding. Not only is it drying every drop of blood, but the meat is also delivered to the table. "Sometimes Guangxi puts the wild in the wild into a large breeding pool, which is convenient for a large amount of use in the factory processing. I saw these dying after the blood was drawn. They were sent to the very simple local house. Liszing these crickets. "Yang Mingzhe said deeply." The meat that people can eat is sold to the restaurant.</p>
<p>The tide and tide, the prosperity scene of Cheng Chengcheng has no longer seen the prosperous scene of the layout of the layout. Instead, it is replaced by floating and sinking shells, and the living fossils eventually become piles of wreckage.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T11-58-18-04-00/000008.png" />Women dismembered the three thorny stomachs that had been drawn in a house in Guangxi, China, and they were skilled in picking out the meat and selling them into the catering market.

<p>In order to save the endangered fate of the, in 2021, China included the three thorn and roundtails in the "National Key Protection of Wildlife List" and became a national second -level protection wildlife. Yang Mingzhe said that some reagent manufacturers in China have stated that they have stopped supplying some tested agents that have seriously consumed the resource. Relevant units have also begun to ban illegal incidents and sentenced them to punishment. It is still in a gray area in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite the upgrade of the protection level of Sannuki, China's new version of the "Wildlife Protection Law" on May this year, the provisions mentioned that "due to scientific research, artificial breeding, public display performances, cultural relics protection, or other special conditions, they need to be sold or purchased.

<p>At the press conference of the "Global Financing Contract Summit" held in Paris on the 22nd in Paris, U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen 22 said in the statement that President Biden said Chinese leader Xi Jinping said, "President Bayon and I think the United States thinks the United States and I think the United States thinks the United States. It is important to maintain communication ... ... to clarify misunderstandings and differences ", we need to cooperate in the field of energy. She did not say that there were indeed differences between the United States and China.</p>
<p>The Chinese State Council Prime Minister Li Qiang attended the Global Financial Summit held on global climate change and poverty issues as a Chinese representative. Yellen said he was happy to see the Chinese participation. She also said, "as President Biden said, the two largest economies in the world are working together to deal with global challenges, which is important."</p>
<p>President Biden used a dictator to describe Xi Jinping at a fundraising event on the 20th, which caused condemnation from the Chinese government. The Associated Press reported that the confrontation led to a new crack in Sino -US relations after the end of the visit to China. The purpose of Blindken's visit to China is to ease the current US -China relations that have fallen to the freezing point.</p>

The ship's time in this sensitive waters was the next day for US Secretary of State Brills to end his visit to Beijing. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Navy said that the ship carried out the "routine Taiwan Strait transit" based on international law, indicating that the United States is committed to maintaining the free opening of the Indo -Pacific region. In this regard, Gan Yu, a spokesman for the China Maritime Police News Bureau, said that Stradon passed away from the Taiwan Strait, and the Chinese Maritime Police Fleet went to the supervisor throughout the process, corresponding to the treatment according to law and regulations. The Chinese Maritime Police will strengthen cruise and enforcement in the waters of China, and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty. Earlier this month, the US missile destroyer Zhong Yun and the Royal Canadian Navy frigate Monterer sailed in the Taiwan Strait. At that time, a Chinese ship cut in front of the US ship and was less than 150 yards. The Chinese official Global Times reported that Li Haidong, a professor at the School of Foreign Affairs, said that Brinken left his front foot, and the back of the US Coast Guard passed the Taiwan Strait. Obviously, the United States still promoted Taiwan to curb China on the Taiwan issue. This incident once again exposed the two sides of the United States' diplomacy against China. However, the Global Times pointed out that compared with the previous navigation of the Taiwan Strait, the United States did not send warships this time, but sent the coastal guards alone. Correspondingly, China also responded to the China Sea Police, not the PLA, not the PLA, not the PLA, not the PLA, not the PLA Eastern theater. Responsible editor: Rao Yiming</p>

<p>Australian Electronic Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant was a Twitter employee. She said that this social platform is now responsible for complaints for one -third of the online hatred of the country.</p>
<p>She said that Twitter had 28 days to show that it had a serious attitude towards solving the problem, otherwise, every time the last period was missed, it would face a fine of $ 700,000 (S $ 638 million).</p>
<p>Grant pointed out that Twitter must show "which measures it is taking to prevent network hatred on its platform from spreading and executing its own rules." She said: "We need these platforms to take responsibility and take action to protect their users."</p>
<p>Since Elonmusk purchased the platform in October 2022, it has cut more than 80 % of employees around the world, including many content administrators responsible for eliminating improper remarks. In November last year, Musk also let tens of thousands of users who had banned previously banned the platform.</p>
<p>Australia took the lead in promoting global regulatory social media platforms, which is not the first time that Grant has criticized Twitter. She sent a letter to Musk last November, expressing her concerns about Twitter's large layoffs that would cause the company to be unable to comply with the law.</p>

<p>According to people familiar with the matter, the Bayeng government in the United States will take advantage of the Indian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230621-1406322">Modi conducted a state visit this week</a>During this period, let some technical workers enter or stay in the United States, which will make Indians living and work in the United States easier.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted a source that the State Council might be announced on Thursday (June 22) that a few Indians and other foreign workers holding H-1B visas would be able to renew the visa in the United States without having to leave the country. The pilot plan may expand in the next few years.</p>
<p>Indian citizen is by far the largest number of people in the H-1B plan, accounting for 73%of nearly 44,200 H-1B workers in FY 2022.</p>
<p>Another US official said: "We all realize that the liquidity of the people is a huge wealth for us ... So, our goal is to solve this problem in many ways."</p>
<p>The US State Department spokesman refused to talk about which visa types were qualified and the time of pilot plans was started. Bloomberg Legal Company(Bloomberg Law)The pilot plan was first reported in February. The White House refused to comment.</p>
<p>The U.S. government issues 65,000 H-1B visas to companies seeking foreign skilled workers each year, and issued 20,000 visas for workers with senior degrees. Visa is valid for three years and can be renewed for three years.</p>
<p>US government data show that in recent years, companies with the most H-1B employees include Indian technology giants Infosys and TATA ConsultationServices, as well as Amazon, Alphabet and Meta in the United States.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the State Council pointed out that some temporary foreign workers can renew their visas in the United States, which will make resources for visa interviews at foreign consulates.</p>
<p>One of the sources said that the pilot plan will also include some workers holding L-1 visas, which are suitable for those who are transferred from the company to the United States.</p>
<p>Another source said that the delegations of the two countries were expected to discuss how to clean up the backlog of the backlog of the US Embassy in India. India has long been worried that it is difficult for its citizens (including workers in the technology industry) to obtain visas living in the United States.</p>
<p>According to data from the Ministry of Labor, as of the end of April, there were about 10 million positions in the United States.</p>
<p>Some H-1B visa holders in the United States include thousands of scientific and technological workers who have been fired this year. They scrambled to find new employers within the 60-day "width limit" to avoid returning to the motherland.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong> 1. Bollingin visits China Facial Observation </strong></p>
<p><strong> _ 230_ </strong> <strong> <em>News</em> </strong> <strong> _ Reappearing the scene of Magalney's visit to China_ </strong></p>
<p>In the past few days, the world's focus on US Secretary of State Brinkeevil visited Beijing. Many observers criticized the US government to ask for this visit, but China had a cold attitude. When Xi Jinping and Brinken met, Xi Jinping's premium chairman's seat above the representatives of the United States and China seemed to be a referee above China and the United States. Inferiority of inferiority. It also made people think of the scene of the British Embassy Georgemacartney, the head of the British Embassy in 1793. (When Emperor Qianlong heard the news of Maliyohn's unwillingness to do his head ceremony, he was quite unhappy. Qianlong issued a rush, claiming that all the tributers who came to the heavens had to kneel and nine. Even if the king visited in person, Also do this gift .... Finally, Emperor Qianlong made a concession when he was in a good mood, and agreed to kneel on one knee like the British king when he saw him, but he was free of kisses.) Xi Jinping’s There are very similar behaviors.</p>
<p>Some observers believe that the United States has been asking too much about the problem of visiting China. I think I am afraid this observation is harsh. In general, Brinken did not retreat from the US position from the United States, but achieved his basic goals: adding guardrails to the sharp -and -Chinese relations of the United States and China to avoid it quickly slipped into the conflict of force and obtained Beijing without providing Russia for providing it to Russia. Weapon commitment.</p>
<p>Basically, most international public opinion did not strongly criticize the humble diplomatic posture of US Secretary of State's visit to China, and did not think it was too weak. The reason is that in the field of international diplomatic, in fact, only the strong is qualified to say mild words. Only the strong man has the confidence and does not care about some small tricks and small movements that the opponent is purely for face. The weakness is extremely sensitive and fragile in the eyes of each other's eyes and in the eyes of the international community. In particular, it cares about its image in the eyes of the nationals. Only the weak will say the war wolf -style words when Cixi declared war to the Eleven Kingdoms: "Instead of the picture, it is shameful, if you are a big tart, a daughter -in -law." She rushed to the temple and fled to Xi'an.</p>
<p><strong> Second, size Hongmen Banquet </strong></p>
<p><strong> _ Basic background_ </strong></p>
<p>You should not forget whether to answer whether the United States is too weak to China such questions, it must be placed in the basic background of the current US -China strength status to observe, and it must be observed in the U.S. -China situation in the world pattern.</p>
<p>What is the basic situation before Brins' visits? I called it two "Hongmen Banquets", one, one and one. The Dahongmen Banquet is a geopolitical ring circle around China. Xiaohongmen Banquet is a Hongmen banquet set by Beijing Yan Zhen to visit the US Secretary of State.</p>
<p><strong> _ _ </strong></p>
<p>The so -called Dahongmen Banquet, just as Xi Jinping, who once vowed to think of "Dongsheng to the West" himself, had to be angry and angry at the people's conference not long ago: "Western countries led by the United States have implemented a comprehensive containment, encirclement to me 2. Suppressing, bringing unprecedented challenges to our country's development. "He said," We must adhere to the bottom line of thinking and extreme thinking, and prepare for the major test of high waves and even stormy. " Essence</p>
<p>It's "limit" and "stormy waves". What is so terrible? What is the "severe situation" faced by the Communist Party of China?</p>
<p>Since the two years since the Bayndon government took office, it has generally inherited the Grand direction of the Trump administration in terms of policies against China and added the basic strategy of joint allies. To say more, in terms of local political and military trends and high -tech blockade, for two years, the allies have been united in the past two years.</p>
<p>One Indo -Pacific Strategy: Polar confrontation, three -sided alliance (AUKUS), Quad (QUAD), FVEY (FVEY). Coupled with the US -Japan security treaty, the US -South Korea Washington Declaration, Taiwan Relations Law, Taiwan Policy Law ... Among them, the mechanism of the United States, Japan, Australia and India is the cornerstone and key (now South Korea has joined the Quartet mechanism to expand into a five -party mechanism), the three sides of the United States, Australia and Britain are important military alliances (Japan also considered joining), the United States, Britain, Australia and the New Five Eyes Alliance It is the basic intelligence network. All these are superimposed to form the Indo -Pacific Security Network that has resumed Tianwang, which is enough to fight against the challenges of any axis country.</p>
<p><strong> _ Some Chinese scholars say that if the CCP moves in Taiwan, it will face the situation of four -sided operations_ </strong></p>
<p>After the Prime Minister Kidtada in Japan strengthened the US -Japan Alliance, after the Japanese and South Korea's reconciliation of Japanese and South Korea, after the Yin Xiyue visit to Japan, after signing the Washington Declaration of the US and South Korea, the <strong> North Triangle framework was basically constructed. Immediately after the United States signed a joint statement to build the southern triangle </strong>. These two triangles, coupled with the military cooperation between Taiwan and the United States, extended from Northeast Asia to the South China Sea, there are India in the west, the first island chain of Japan and South Korea in the east, and Australia in the Pacific Rim in the southern end. The "Japan -British Mutual Access Agreement", "The United States and Japan Security Alliance" and "AUCUS AUCUS" have expanded the relationship between Japan and key partners -such as Australia and the United Kingdom, from quasi -allies to war allies. Because Japan also signed a mutual access agreement with Australia last year. Therefore, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia have become a military alliance that can be held in each other to form a complete siege of the CCP's India -like encirclement. It has formed a physical nightmare for the Beijing regime.</p>
<p><strong> _ g7 + 8_ </strong> <strong> _ Hiroshima Summit_ </strong>Since the end of World War II, there has not been any period of contemporary, so many mainstream Western countries, plus opponents during World War II, Germany, and Italy, and even later alliance countries India united to use the CCP regime as the opponent. China has become Japan and Germany on the eve of World War II. The creator of this situation is the United States.</p>
<p>Under this situation, the United States, which has its own strength and the strength of the majority of allies, came to the door to talk to Beijing to talk to the surrounding person to talk about how to control divergence and prevent the gun from getting angry. Is the United States show weakness? Is this admitting? In fact, China is at a clear disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong> <em>The carefully designed tribute etiquette</em> </strong></p>
<p>How can Beijing talk under such a big surround situation? Xi Jinping has a thousand reasons that do not go to the banquet to negotiate around the party. Therefore, I have been twisting, still holding the pipa half -cover, and do not show their positions. But do you not talk about it? If he directly refuses to find the US emperor, it means that he has the courage to choose the conflict of the real gun? Therefore, I have to welcome guests.</p>
<p>But how does this qi swallow? So the staff presented suggestions. After such a careful design, the Chinese etiquette appeared, and it created the scene of the US emperor to tribute to me. This has the above -mentioned wonderful ritual ceremony. The Emperor Qianlong, the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, summoned the Emperor Magali to make his knees kneeling, and it was really smart. It saved the face of the emperor's emperor, and the addiction to the direction to the world was sufficient. President Xi played a psychological victory, which was enough to carry the diplomatic history and Liu Fangbai. As long as he does not fall into a series of failed wars after the double losses of 230 years ago and the treaty for his cutting compensation.</p>
<p>But will this ridiculous self -pretending diplomatic farce bring him a historical reputation? Soon, you can hear the response from international and domestic.</p>
<p><strong> _ Xiaohongmen Banquet_ </strong></p>
<p>State Secretary of State Brills entered China under the conditions of unknown unknown areas. Although he went to the meeting with a single knife, although he encountered etiquette offending, the principle of the United States had not lost, and he met with Xi Wang Qin's whole set of people.</p>
<p>Beijing has pushed the responsibility of deteriorating Sino -US relations to the United States. Brincken's press conference to visit China explained that Beijing is the responsible person of the deterioration of Sino -US relations. Brinken said that since 2014, Sino -US trade has developed strongly. There are 300,000 students in China in the United States. Because, as the Treasury Secretary Yellen said, decourse will be fatal.</p>
<p>For the United States to include some Chinese companies into the export control list and restrict the export of chip exports to China, Brinken said that this is also one of the important issues of the two parties. He clarified that the United States did so for national security considerations, not comprehensive restrictions on China. He said that it provided the CCP that may not be used to deal with the interests of the United States.</p>
<p>"When the CCP participates in the construction of the nuclear weapon plan in a very opaque way, when it produces the hypersonic missile, when it uses technology to suppress the people of the country, how can these specific technologies be provided to the CCP that meets us our specific technologies. Interests? Other countries also feel the same. "</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brills went to Beijing this time to go to a small Hongmen banquet. Although Xi CCP made some tricks that did not board the Daya Church in the etiquette, the Secretary of State was not shocked, and it was reasonable and conducive. What should be said to say that Blint only went to Xiaohong Gate's banquet in a single knife and retreated throughout the body. Do not humiliate the mission.</p>
<p>I call the encirclement and isolation of the international mainstream society facing the Beijing regime as a large -scale Hongmen banquet. Does Xi Jinping dare to go to this great banquet? Forgive him without this courage. He could only avoid the banquet and cycle in the Zhongnanhai. If you act lightly, you will definitely ask Jun to enter.</p>
<p>This is the difference between open society and totalitarian closed regime.</p>
<p><strong> The two parties who reached Blingken visited China moved </strong> **</p>
<p>The cause of Blingken's visits to China to visit China:</p>
<ul>
<li>Factors of the Russian and Ukraine War, avoid the two -tier operations * ensure that Beijing does not provide weapons and ammunition for Russia at the critical moment of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xi Jinping's political power received some motivation for Bollingin to visit China:</p>
<ul>
<li>The strategic formation of the United States, Britain, Japan,,, South Korea,,,,, South Korea,,,,, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea. The decline of the fall* China's economy has fallen sharply, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 20%. Brinkens visited Huarlen Finance Minister and Commercial Minister Raymond to visit Hua Mong. Otherwise, negotiations such as economic and trade tariffs, chips and AI technology cannot be mentioned, and the economy will be further lower. * Beijing is willing to show the Chinese cooperation to Europe and other American allies to win Europe * prevent or delay the official COVID-19 virus traceability investigation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Inventory of the results of Bollingin's visit to China </strong></p>
<p><strong> <em>China media refers to five "two parties agree</em> </strong> <strong>" </strong></p>
<p>1) The two parties agree to implement the consensus reached by worshiping Xi Jinping's meeting in Bali: "Effectively controlled differences and promote dialogue exchange and cooperation";</p>
<p>2) The two parties agree to maintain high -level exchanges, and Qin Gang is willing to visit the United States when both sides are convenient;</p>
<p>3) The two parties agree to continue to promote the guiding consultation of Sino -US relations;</p>
<p>4) The two parties agree to continue to promote the consultation of the Sino -US joint working group to solve the specific problems of bilateral relations;</p>
<p>5) The two parties agree to expand the cultural and educational exchanges between the two countries and actively discuss increasing passenger flights. Welcome more students, scholars, and business people to visit each other.</p>
<p>Checking carefully, its results are not great; except for the increase in flights, the specific results that can be regarded as visible only communicate the dialogue pipeline; the rest are false and empty words.</p>
<p>The basic crux -Taiwan issue has not obtained consensus verbally. (But there seems to be a tacit understanding of non -text)</p>
<p>Military high -level exchanges have not been agreed with Beijing (the problem is due to whether the US sanctions on the US Defense Director Li Shangfu).</p>
<p><strong> Three, basic evaluation </strong></p>
<p>Overall, this time Brinken's visit to China, as far as the low -key goals set by it, are generally not significant and meaningful.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to the Wall Street Journal this Wednesday (June 21), quoting predecessors and current US officials reported that one of the three researchers in the three Wuhan virus research institutes who suffered from unknown diseases in the early days of the new crown epidemic occurred. Scientists have participated in the coronary virus research project funded by the US government.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Sunday Times (The Sunday Times) reported on June 11 that a US State Department investigators found that an U.S. intelligence report that had not been disclosed before showing that in November 2019, China engaged in coronary virus -related experiments in China Among the researchers, some people have symptoms similar to the new coronal virus, "due to serious illness, they are seeking hospitalization for hospitalization."</p>
<p>Last week, American news media Public quoted several US government officials that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute(Wiv)Three scientists Ben Hu, Zhu Yan, and Yu Ping (transliteration). In the fall of 2019, they appeared as symptoms of new crown pneumonia. At that time, they were conducting research on coronary viruses in bat body.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the information learned by the Wall Street Journal from government officials. U.S. officials say that the symptoms of these researchers are "consistent with the new crown or a seasonal disease", but the nature of the diseases they suffer from has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T13-20-00Z/58137897_401.jpg" />Shi Zhengli, director of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, in the laboratory (data map)</p>
<p>The report also stated that Hu Ben has once and the director of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/病毒起源八卦满天飞-石正丽我没做错/a-57893830">Shi Zhengli</a>Have close cooperation. Most of Hu Ben focuses on modifying coronary viruses and enables it to combine with human cells. He also participated in the coronary virus research project funded by the US government.</p>
<h3>Gao Fu: Do not rule out any possibility</h3>
<p>Former US Department of Health and Public Service(Health and Human Services Department)Robertkadlec of senior officials told the Wall Street Journal that the coronary virus experiments related to SARS announced by the three scientists were performed in an inappropriate low biological safety environment and may lead to laboratory infection.</p>
<p>For example, Yu Ping has a paper among the three of the three "and scientific articles published by other Chinese scientists also show that a considerable part of the coronary virus research was performed in the second -level facilities of biological safety. China) Biological Safety Level 3 or Biological Safety Level 4 Laboratory is usually used for high -risk research. "</p>
<p>For more than three years since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, the origin of the virus is still a highly arguing topic, and it has long been derived from a scientific issue into international relations and political issues. The scientific community from the beginning that the virus basically supported the virus from the nature of the nature and the spread of the animal host to human beings. At present, the "laboratory leak" hypothesis is open.</p>
<h3>Virus Origin Survey Report After release, controversy continues</h3>
<p>The long -term attention of this matter <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美能源部fbi指疫情源自中国实验室泄漏-白宫称尚无结论/a-64828455">the evaluation of this issue of various intelligence departments in the United States</a>It's so sincere. The Chinese government has always denied any "laboratory leakage" that may originate from Wuhan virus. According to the official Chinese statement, the first new crown virus diagnosis was a man who was sick on December 8, 2019.</p>

At that time, after the members of the citizenship team discussed privately, they believed that someone might be intentionally troubled and tried to discredit the meeting and decided to ignore the meeting. After that, Xin said to him, he immediately responded to her: Don't stab the basket.</p>

<p>On June 21, the USCGC Stratton cannon was passed through the Taiwan Strait. This operation coincided with the next day of Brinken's end of the visit to China, which attracted the dissatisfaction of China.</p>
<p>According to the news released by the China Maritime Police Station on the 22nd, China has accused the US Coast Guard of "Strarton" from the Taiwan Strait. Copy handling and "resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and marine rights."</p>
<p>The statement issued by the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet on the same day shows that the "Straton" is a routine to pass through the Taiwan Strait in accordance with the Gonghai navigation and freedom of Gonghai. The statement added: "The" Strarton "crossing the Taiwan Strait shows the United States' commitment to the Indo -Pacific region that is free to open, and the U.S. military will fly, sail and activities anywhere allowed anywhere international law."</p>

<p>In recent years, the US and allies warships have performed free sailing mission in the Taiwan Strait, which often causes Beijing's dissatisfaction and regards it as provocations. As China has increased political and military pressure, and claims the Taiwan Strait as a non -international sea area last year, the Taiwan Strait region has also become a stage for the United States and China.</p>
<p>As the outside world pays attention to whether Brinken's visit to China can alleviate the tension between the United States and China, the latest friction incident seems to push the situation again.</p>
<p>Yan Xuetong, the official Chinese official "Beijing Daily" quoted on Wednesday, said that he did not agree with the statement of the United States and China that he had entered the "New Cold War." A policy statement, and the diplomacy of large powers depends on the actual policy instead of rhetoric.</p>
<p>Yan Xuetong believes that "the current situation of Sino -US relations is that conflicts are greater than cooperation. In the case of conflict greater than cooperation, the two parties can carry out more negative cooperation, not active cooperation." He pointed out that the so -called "negative cooperation" is the conduct of both parties conducted by the two parties. Cooperation is to prevent the deterioration or upgrade of conflicts, and "active cooperation" is difficult to carry out in the current state.</p>

<p>The Canadian Security Intelligence Agency explained through Twitter to explain the Chinese intelligence department(Gamble)How the agent's goal of "approaching and cultivating" on the Internet. Tongwen said that the first step of the Chinese intelligence department will use agents to determine the objects they want to recruit. They are aiming at Canadians who are actively looking for key departments work or have high value qualifications. The second step, the Chinese agent leads the English through the workplace social platform(LinkedIn)The secret is close to the goal, and it will be disguised as a variety of identities such as human resources recruiters or consultants. Then, the communication methods of each other will be transferred to other platforms as soon as possible, such as WeChat, WhatsApp or email. Then, the goal will be required to write a report for the "consultant", or may be invited to meet with "customer". However, the so -called consultants and customers are actually Chinese intelligence staff, but their goals do not know. They write reports of "secrets of interest and privileges in China" in accordance with the instructions, so they have received remuneration. The Security Intelligence Bureau issued a pushing warning: "Don't be the goal of recruitment of the Chinese intelligence department, be careful that you contact the people on the LinkedIn and all other network platforms." Seeing the public warning of the Canadian intelligence authority, Shi Guoliang, a professor at the University of Ottawa University, felt that it felt that it felt that it felt that it felt that it felt this. Grequisite, he said that China ’s penetration of Canada is pervasive and will try every way or fight its locking goals. Shi Guoliang, who has a strong ability to listen and, read and write in Putonghua, is an expert in anthropology and social research. He has also visited China many times, but after a long contact, he gradually understood that many actions taken by the Chinese government were unique to ulterior motives. Essence "I know I was invited to go to them to attend the seminar. There are goals and to cultivate feelings. I hope I can sympathize with them. But I do it. I know the most advanced city, such as Beijing, if you walk into the alley, you will see another China. "He said that China actively attracts some characters in Western politics and business, hoping that they can speak and do things for China. A confidential document of the Canadian Security Intelligence Agency was exposed last month, which described how China imposed influence on Canadian members, corporate executives and Chinese communities through seductive and punishment methods. The Canadian Security Intelligence Agency and the Royal Madon subsequently explained how to deal with China's intervention in Canada in Congress and other public places. Last week, several people living in the Greater Vancouver region jointly reported to the Royal Mading Police by the harassment of the Chinese authorities. One of the people John said that they came to report the case in April. Paying attention to the issue, I have called the situation and asked the situation, and now their reports have officially made a case.</p>

<p>A new study shows that the day of nagging may slow down brain atrophy and delay brain aging for up to seven years.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency quoted the report published by the "Reference News" a few days ago that many studies in the past have shown that nap can improve brain performance and beauty and beauty, but there is almost no evidence to show how to improve the performance of the brain during the day.</p>
<p>The report from the British "Daily Telegraph" website stated that scientists from the University of London's college who conducted research found that there was a certain causal relationship between habitual day aversion and larger brain capacity. According to the information collected from the British between 400,000 years old between 40 and 69 years, the human brain capacity of people who like to sleep at noon is equivalent to delaying brain aging from 2.6 to 6.5 years.</p>
<p>The capacity of the brain capacity is the inner cavity of the skull, which is related to the low risk of good cognitive health and the low risk of dementia.</p>
<p>The first author of the research report and doctoral student Valentina Pas said: "This is the first study to try to solve the causal relationship between habitual nap and cognition and brain structure."</p>
<p>Dr. Victoria Golfeld, a senior researcher, said: "I hope that such research can prove that the nap is good for health."</p>
<p>In the paper published in the American journal "Sleep Health", the research team also said that the association between the nap and the brain capacity may also mean that the nap "can make up for the lack of sleep to prevent the degeneration of the nerve tissue."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T14-43-00-04-00/000000.png" />During the June 4th period of 2022, Chinese netizens "Yipinhong" (formerly known as Huang Zhihong) commemorate the video clip of June 4 in the form of a hand dance <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/wy-06222023140343.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T14-43-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Video screenshot <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/wy-06222023140343.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibao/renquanfazhi/wy-06222023140343.html/@stream</a>During the June 4th period of this year and last year, Chinese netizens "Yipinhong" (formerly known as Huang Zhihong) commemorated the videos of June 4th in the form of hand dance, which attracted widespread attention outside the Chinese network firewall. This station has recently learned that "Yipinhong" has been monitored and harassed by the National Security Police for a long time, and his life has been trapped.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/sc-06092023100612.html"><strong> CCP has changed for many years? The 1989th generation watched the June 4th massacre and dynamic clear zero </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/sc-06062023091745.html">Cross -generation warriors: "June 4th" in the eyes of "white paper"</a></strong></p>
<p>One day after June 4 this year, Wang Zhihua, who was in New York, talked in the video with "Yipinhong", and saw her crying: "She has been crying, as long as we video call, she cries. She treats me as a good Friends, treat me as an object of crying. When she was venting like this, she might be more comfortable, otherwise it would be unprepared. "Wang Zhihua explained that the police's long -term monitoring of" Yipin Red "made her physically and mentally exhausted.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T14-43-00-04-00/000002.png" />Netizen "Yipinhong" and Wang Zhihua video call screenshot (provided by Wang Zhihua) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/wy-06222023140343.html/wy0622.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-22T14-43-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> The birth of dance </strong></p>
<p>"Yipinhong" commemorates the "June 4th" hand dance video. It was first shot around 2021 and uploaded to the WeChat circle of friends. But soon, the relevant videos were deleted by the Chinese Internet police. Around June 4th, this video appeared on overseas network platforms.</p>
<p>This station found that the earliest record of Youtube, the video agency media platform, was released on June 5, 2022, and was released by the Chinese media platform "Chinese Digital Age" in the United States. However, according to several contacts of "Yipinhong", what really caused this video to attract the attention of the Chinese police is that on September 15 last year, Zhou Feng Suo, the leader of Tiananmen School of Xuemen, who was in the United States, reposted the video through his Twitter.</p>
<p>When Zhou Fengsuo was inquiring by the reporter from this station, he also said sorry, "I have brought her a disaster." He said that after seeing this video, he contacted "Yipin Red" last year. At that time, he only played on WeChat at that time. After saying hello, thanking her for making this video, I didn't talk much. However, according to Wang Zhihua, it is precisely because of this brief greeting that "Yipinhong" has become the target of Chinese police monitoring.</p>
<p>"Yipinhong" was originally known as Huang Zhihong and operated a clothing store in Jiangmen City, Guangdong. According to Huang Zhihong's two friends, Huang Zhihong is not a professional dancer. She is just a amateur dance enthusiast. During the June 4th period of 2021, Huang Zhihong felt the news about the 1989 June 4th massacre on the Internet. Temporary intention, without rehearsal, made this video of expressing mourning.</p>
<p>"It was completely out of feeling. It was caused by the candlelight and sorrow of June 4th at that time. Dance was very natural. She was taken at home as a background at home. It was because of this naturally shooting. When you come out, the kind of dance really moves a lot of people, "Wang Zhihua introduced this way.</p>
<p>The reporter of this station saw on Twitter that whether this video appeared last year or around June and Fourth this year, there were extremely high viewing and forwarding volume. Only one of the examples: On June 4 this year, the push friend "Fairy Fairy" (@Huaxianzi999) posted this video in the tweet. From the time of this report, there were nearly 200,000 views, 434 reposted 434 times, reposted 434 times. Praise with 1426 times.</p>
<p>From this video that is only one minute, it can be seen that in front of a pure black background, Huang Zhihong wore a loose black long -sleeved clothes and accompanied by sorrowful music. Two soft hands continued to change various types in front of the camera. Gestures, sometimes like a low -wing swan, sometimes like hovering pigeons. There were twice in the middle, her right hand to the number of the six, and the number of the left hand to the four, the dance meant that the dance was very clearly pointed at the tragedy of the June 4th massacre.</p>
<p>"Xiyan" in the United States is Huang Zhihong's friend. She told this station that she and Huang Zhihong communicated the video. "I saw that video at the time, which was shocking. I knew it was her. Later, we said that the video had been deleted. She had no intention to use it. This form is just expressed. "</p>
<p><strong> Touch the pain of the times </strong></p>
<p>Huang Zhihong's expression seems to be a resonance of an era, and it has also touched the pain of many people. For many years of netizens and Chen Xiangwei, who is currently in the United States, told this reporter that when this video was sent out on WeChat during June 4th in 2021, he reminded Huang Zhihong to pay attention to safety, but he understood her mentality, " Many people are like this, so as not to let them speak, and it is uncomfortable in the stomach. Just like those netizens in my circle of friends, they are saying some fair words for this society and the people. Let's see a lot of hope. "</p>
<p>This reporter has tried to contact Huang Zhihong himself many times, but several of her friends replied that Huang Zhihong would not be interviewed because of safety considerations because of safety reasons. Chen Xiangwei also called Huang Zhihong himself for this reason, but was also declined by the other party.However, after being released, Huang Zhihong's lives and his daughter's lives were in close monitoring of the police. "From then on, (police) have harassment and 'drink tea'. The most terrible thing is to track. Parking the police car at the door of her shop and staying there, which causes great trouble for their spirit and life." Wang Zhihua said that because of concerns about the safety of herself and her family, Huang Zhihong and her twelve -year -old daughter now have depression.</p>
<p>Wang Zhihua was from Hunan. He had been engaged in democratic activities in Zhuzhou for a long time and was suppressed by the authorities. In May this year, Wang Zhihua came to the United States through the "Route". He also met Huang Zhihong in the circle of domestic democrats. He understood that Huang Zhihong's decision is now unwilling to speak for herself. "She said, I am not a brave person. The purpose of me is just expressing my own voice. "</p>
<p>But Wang Zhihua emphasized that even under the high pressure in China, he must bravely resist. "Some things you don't say, they will not stop harassing you," he once told Huang Zhihong that if the police follow you, you have to be right, you have to be right, you have to be right, you have to be right. They anti -tracking, you have to blame them rationally.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Taiwan Foreign Minister Wu Zhaozheng was interviewed by the German Voice TV "Conflictzone" program. When asked how 23 million people in Taiwan can win a war with a country with a population of 1.4 billion, Wu Zhaoxuan said: "In a modern war, asymmetric operations may be more important than traditional operations. For example In the Ukrainian war, many people predicted that the Russians could occupy Ukraine within a few weeks, but this is not the case. Ukraine has been fighting and restraining the Russian army. The role. This is what we have learned. "</p>
<h3>Voice of Germany TV "Conflict Zone" program interview with Wu Zhaoyi (English)</h3>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng pointed out: "If you have the opportunity to see Taiwan's defense ability, I think China will not be so easy to occupy Taiwan. We have many defensive missiles, and our army is also very determined to defend ourselves](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台湾外长如果中国来袭台湾必将奋战到底/a-57120389)Essence In my opinion, the public is determined to continue to maintain the freedom and sovereignty we have. … In addition, other major countries are also deploying military strength to scare China not to fight against Taiwan. If you look at the U.S. military in the nearby area, or Japan will make military expenses double in the next five years to prepare to counter the possible offensive behavior of China in the region. I think China will worry if China will start a war in Taiwan. "</p>
<p>Wu Zhaoyi also said: "I think, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台湾外交部长吴钊燮台海冲突将是全球灾难/a-59631307">such a war will mean economic disaster for many countries</a>Essence Half of the world's container ships cross the Taiwan Strait area, and 90%of the most advanced computer chips or semiconductor chips are made in Taiwan. Therefore, if the supply chain is blocked, it will have a significant impact on other parts of the world. "</p>
<p>The host asked Wu Zhaozheng how to understand the statement of the US President Biden last year-Biden replied whether he was willing to participate in military defending Taiwan, yes, this is our promise. This means that it provides defensive weapons for Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, or is it involved in direct military confrontation with China?</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng replied: "Our understanding is that the promise is based on the Taiwan Relations Act. The United States is used to provide a sufficient number of defensive weapons for Taiwan's self -defense through Taiwan's self -defense, and repeatedly reiterates its commitment to the safety of Taiwan. If you look at Taiwan, look at Taiwan. Relations law also clearly stipulates that the United States needs to maintain sufficient military power to drive away any acts of arbitrarily vitamin and coercion in the region. Therefore, the United States' commitment to Taiwan or to the region is quite obvious. US officials call this commitment backbone. Such as rock. We do not doubt how to provide weapons for Taiwan and how to use these weapons to use these weapons. Because of these activities, the defense of Taiwan and the United States in the past few years <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美高官接連會晤-專家突顯美台關係重大進展/a-64793954">significant progress has improved</a>Essence "</p>
<h3>"Hong Kong is a real tragedy"</h3>
<p>The host asked: "Do you think that the West is tough enough for China? In the past, you seem to have criticized Europe and the United States that did not resist the new national security law in Hong Kong and followed by the freedom of human rights and citizens. What?"</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng replied: "Hong Kong is a real tragedy. Just in front of us, this people are accustomed to implementing the National Security Law with freedom and opening up. Suddenly, all these freedoms have been deprived by the Chinese government. I think this is an isolated incident. We also saw that Crimea was annexed in 2014, and the West's response to Russia in 2014 was not tough enough. I think this may have a direct or indirect impact on the occurrence of the Ukrainian war. If we cannot take specific measures on China ’s behavior in Hong Kong, I am sure that China will be encouraged to do more such things in the area. If you look at China’ s activities in the East China Sea, Japan is very nervous. In addition to the Taiwan Strait, there are more conflict hotspots. Therefore, I think that the international community needs to look more seriously in China's expansionism and implement dictatorship in the region. At the expense of other democratic politics, it expands its influence in the area. "</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/吴钊燮中国的野心绝不会止于台湾/a-62753915">Wu Zhaozheng</a>Said, [If a war broke out, it will be Taiwan itself if the war broke out.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/吴钊燮若被攻击台湾不指望他国参战/a-65504614)Essence "And we are determined to defend ourselves. There is no doubt. But for other countries, I think the most important thing for them is to show their determination to observe and prevent this war."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66006275/64436527"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-22T15-08-00Z/64436527_303.jpg" /></a>China is the main debt party of African countries</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) The theme of this new Global Financing Contract Summit is "Establishing a New Agreement between the Global Northern and Southern" to seek the way to help low -income countries deal with debt burden and release climate financing funds.</p>
<p>As the world's largest bilateral debt claim country, China plays a core role in Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia, and Ghana through the "common framework" led by the Group 20.</p>
<h3>What is "Common Framework"?</h3>
<p>The so -called "Common Framework" is an initiative launched by the 2020s during the epidemic at the end of 2020, which aims to help high -liabilities re -stable finances faster and easier to help high -liabilities.</p>
<p>This framework gathers the main debt countries, including China and the old-fashioned industrial countries-the so-called Paris Club, which is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新債務圓桌會議將登場-g7中國是絆腳石/a-64692972">debt restructuring plan</a>Negotiations with the debt party.</p>
<p>However, nearly 3 years have passed, and the mechanism has not yet led to any debt reduction agreement, partly because there are differences between wealthy industrial countries and China. In the past ten years, China has rapidly jumped into a major international credit party in the world.</p>
<h3>China Loan for Africa: There are praises and bombs</h3>
<h3>What is the position of China on the issue of debt restructuring?</h3>
<p>China hopes that multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and WorldBank can bear part of the losses, but these international institutions and many developed countries, especially the United States, oppose this plan. The reason why the United States and European countries oppose are that if they agree to the requests in Beijing, it is equivalent to providing assistance to China in disguise.</p>
<p>Among them <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/债务难题如何解美财长和imf总裁访问赞比亚/a-64491558">Zambia</a>It is a typical case. The country owed $ 6 billion in China's debt, which has fallen into a debt default nearly three years ago. This inland country located in southeastern Africa can no longer get more loans from the IMF, because Beijing insists on adhering to the multilateral borrowing party to participate in debt reduction and exemption-and this is an uncommon approach in the past.</p>
<p>The "common framework" requires the country to obtain a reorganization permit from the bilateral lenders, and then the commercial creditors and multilateral financial institutions-this makes Beijing displeased.</p>
<p>China continues to negotiate with the debt country on the basis of bilateral bilateral, and calls on debt management to be based on the "specific analysis of specific cases", although the main purpose of the "common framework" is to provide a standardized process of debt deduction.</p>
<p>At the G20 Treasury Secretary and the Central Bank President's meeting held in April this year, Yi Gang, President of the People's Bank of China, emphasized that "China is willing to cooperate with all parties to implement the common framework of debt reduction and exemption."</p>
<p>At a press conference in March, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked whether Beijing would agree to reorganize the implementation of Ghana's $ 1.9 billion debt, and told reporters: "The official bilateral debt with China only occupies only the official bilateral debt occupies only to the China. Ghana's total foreign debt is less than 5%. "She called on multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors to participate in the debt reduction and exemption process of developing countries, because these subjects are the main credists in developing countries.</p>
<h3>Controversial Chinese investor in Ethiopia</h3>
<h3>Why are some debt China willing to reduce and exempt, and some do not want?</h3>
<p>In January of this year, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang announced that he was partially exempted from the country's $ 13.7 billion in debt from China since 2000 to the present.</p>
<p>In August last year, China was exempted from 23 interest -free loans owed to 17 African countries. The debt had expired at the end of 2021. These interest -free funds come from the budget funds for foreign aid in China, so the procedures for deductibles are relatively simple.</p>
<p>According to the data provided by the Aiddata platform, from 2000 to 2017, the total interest -free loan issued by China's total US $ 843 billion of a total of $ 843 billion in the 165 countries government accounted for less than 5%.</p>
<h3>What support does China provide?</h3>
<p>In early May, China participated in the first meeting of the Sri Lanka Council as an observer. Japan, India, and France initiated this talk, although <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国延长还债期-斯里兰卡则希望中国能做更多/a-64499122">China is the largest bilateral debt party in Sri Lanka</a>Essence As of the end of 2021, this South Asian island country owed $ 7.4 billion in debt in China.</p>
<p>In the subsequent discussion of Ghana in May, China strengthened participation and agreed to co -ly the co -chair of the Ghana's official creditors committee with France.</p>
<p>Regarding Zambia's case, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said that "China has always attached importance to Zabia's debt issues and will also actively cooperate and strive to find better solutions."</p>
<h3>What should I do next?</h3>
<p>Analysts speculate that at this Paris conference, China will continue to explain the support of the "common framework", but it still advocates debt reduction on the basis of "specific cases specific analysis".</p>
<p>When the "common framework" held a meeting in Washington, China suggested that IMF accelerate the speed and improve quality in sharing debt sustainable analysis information.</p>
<p>Reuters pointed out that in order to allow China to agree to reduce more debt, countries may need a lot of persuasion.</p>

HRMI spokesman Thalia Kehoe Rowden told this station that research shows that Chinese citizens and political rights have not improved, and the opinions of experts are very consistent.</p>
<p><strong> Citizen and political rights have been captured </strong> <strong><em>* </em>* No one can be spared in China </strong></p>
<p>It is worth noting that HRMI invites experts to select "high -risk people", that is, from the options provided by the questionnaire, the citizens and political rights of which groups are selected are the most vicious. It was found that experts generally believe that the rally, freedom of speech, and freedom of religious belief in China are deprived of the rights of rally, freedom of speech, and freedom of religious beliefs in China;</p>
<p>Luo Deng said: "These lists are very long and longer than all the countries we have studied. Experts basically believe that everyone in China is caught in risks and cannot enjoy their citizens and political rights. In fact, we are in the questionnaire.

Rachema, British Uyghur Human Rights activist. Rahimamahmut is one of the experts involved in evaluating the human rights of China. She was not surprised to the results of HRMI's research.</p>
<p>"The results of the study reflect the real situation. As far as I know, the Uyghur who are caught in the concentration camp must first deny their religion and say that there is no God in the world, and Xi Jinping is supplying everything they need. Leaders. This not only happened to the Uyghur, but also recently reported on the Hui Muslims, Christians and all religious groups. "</p>
<p>HRMI spokesman Loden mentioned in particular that although the quality of life of the Chinese people is generally guaranteed, the children of the conscience and the children of the unusual people are particularly vulnerable to the right to be educated, showing that the Chinese government's suppression of the disagreements, "sitting even sitting "Fa" style disasters extend the next generation.</p>

<h4>Nvidia Corporation (Nasdaq Stock Exchange code: NVDA)</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-22T18-53/000000.png" />Nvidia's stock price has risen 200.70 % so far this year. (Reuters)</p>
<p>The chip manufacturing giant Yingweida has another long -term board member, and the stock price of Nvidia has soared for a while.</p>
<p>According to documents submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) overnight, Markstevens, who has been working in Nvidia's board of directors since 2008, trading on Friday (16th) and Tuesday (20th) During the period, a total of 11,8602 stocks were sold.</p>
<p>Stevens sold these stocks at a price of $ 429.90 to $ 434.20 per share. This means that he has received more than $ 51 million this time. These are the stocks that he indirectly owns with his wife through a trust fund.</p>
<p>According to FACTSET data, before this operation, Stevens was the second largest in Nvidia, second only to the company's co -founder and CEO Huang Renxun.</p>
<p>The file submitted to the SEC also shows that Stevens continued to hold 1.05 million Nvida shares in the trust fund he and his wife. He still holds Nvidia's 1.98 million shares in another trust fund and also directly owns 1.29 million Nvide shares.</p>
<p>In addition to Stevens, Nvidia also has two other long -term directors that have recently risen by the stock price. Tenchcoxe, a member of Nvidia's board of directors, also disclosed last week that he sold the Ainem Nvida shares with a total value of $ 38 million in early June, and then sold another $ 21 million of Nvidia stocks last week.</p>
<p>Another board member Harvey Jones also sold more than $ 28 million in Nvidia stocks earlier this month. Jones later sold more than $ 48 million in stocks last week.</p>
<p>Nvidia's stock is the big winner of the game so far this year. Wall Street industry generally believes that, driven by artificial intelligence boom, Nvidia will have huge profitable potential. Of course, market investors generally do not like to see those in the company selling stocks. After all, these bureaus are most familiar with the company's internal business.</p>
<p>The basic view of market participants is that if the people in the bureau know that the company's business and their performance are strong, they will basically not sell stocks on hand. However, it is undeniable that Nvidia's stock price has risen 200.70 % so far this year, and the return is indeed very attractive.</p>
<p>Of the 33 analysts of Tipranks, 30 rated Nvidia shares, and three rated "guards". The average target price of the first -year period was $ 464.85.</p>

<p>However, the prospects of the initiative are not optimistic. Although it has been postponed several times, Russia has always expressed dissatisfaction with the failure to benefit from Russia's agriculture, and warns many times that they will refuse to extend the initiative again.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Minister of Agriculture Mykola Solsky in June stated that if Russia decided to withdraw from the initiative, the Kiev Capital prepared a plan B.</p>
<p>He said that the Ukraine administration has established a special insurance fund worth about $ 547 million (about S $ 733 million) for the company's company that enters the Ukrainian Black Sea port ship. Ukraine can also export food through the port of small Danube and the Western border with the EU.</p>
<p>Trofim Caisova, who was once the Minister of Agriculture, said Ukraine must prepare Russia's exit initiative, but she skepticized the extent that insurance funds could play a role in helping exports.</p>

<p>The Bank of England unexpectedly raised 50 basis points to increase interest rates to 5%, the highest level since September 2008.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee composed of nine members voted on Thursday (June 22) that the result of seven votes to two votes decided to increase interest rates to 5%. This is also the 13th rate hike since November 2021.</p>
<p>The market was previously expected to raise interest rates at 50 basis points of the British Bank of UK only 40 %, and most economists are expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. There is also a guessing that the interest rate at the beginning of next year may reach a peak of 6%, the highest level in more than 20 years, and the Bank of England has not weakened this prediction.</p>
<p>"If there is evidence that there is more continuous pressure, the monetary policy must be further tightened in the letter to the Minister of Finance Hunter."</p>
<p>He also pointed out that reducing Britain's inflation is the "absolute priority" of the central bank. The Monetary Policy Commission will take necessary measures to strive to let inflation fall to the target level of 2%.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that the significant interest rate hikes at the expected expectations showed that even if the Fed's suspension of currency tightening policy, the rise in British borrowing costs will still run throughout the summer.</p>
<p>Rating interest rate hikes means that the borrower will face greater difficulties. Since March 2022, Britain's two -year mortgage loan interest rate has doubled to more than 6%. Experts warn that when family reinstatement is difficult to continue, mortgage liquidation will become "timing bombs."</p>
<p>Bloomberg Economic Research predicts that if interest rates reach the market expectations of 6%, the British economy will fall into a decline.</p>
<p>Reducing inflation is also a major goal of Prime Minister Sunak and the Conservative Government. Reuters reported that Sunak stated on the same day that he supported the central bank's interest rate hikes and pointed out that the central bank took strong measures to reduce inflation.</p>
<p>He also emphasized that he was "absolutely confident" of the goal of achieving the halving inflation this year.</p>

<p>Ireland's "public opinion consultation" starts from the southern city of Cork today. Tomorrow will be held on Galway on the West Coast, and then ended in the capital Dublin on the 26th and 27th.</p>
<p>The debate about whether Ireland joined the Northern Atlantic Organization (NATO) not only stimulates people's emotions, but also changes the routes that have followed by previous governments since World War II.</p>
<p>Irish President Michael D. Higgins condemned the government last week to ask this issue. Presidential President's position is politically belonging to the role of etiquette.</p>
