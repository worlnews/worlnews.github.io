<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T03-51-29-00-00/000183725_piclink.jpg" />Recently, French President Macron denied the establishment of a office in Tokyo, which aroused widespread attention in the world. According to reports: Macron said at a meeting that NATO should not expand its tentacles to the North Atlantic region, and added: "If ... we promote the expansion of NATO expansion and geographical areas, we will make a big mistake. . "This statement aroused a great uproar, and more importantly, this actually made NATO's establishment office in Tokyo, which became complicated and would not go smoothly.</p>
<p>However, objectively speaking, France does have the ability to put NATO into Asia. On the one hand, this is because the voting method of the North Atlantic Council of NATO's decision -making agencies is the integration principle of the whole; on the other hand, French diplomacy is actually a double foreign minister system, and the French government and French president have each diplomatic team. This reality also makes it not easy for NATO to enter the Asian station.</p>

The official data released by the German Federal Bureau of Statistics on May 25 shows that the German economy has fallen into a recession. After the price, seasons and working days were adjusted, Germany fell 0.3%from the previous quarter of this year, a correction of the 0%growth forecast released in the previous month. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Germany's GDP fell 0.5%month -on -month. Here, Germany's GDP declined in two consecutive quarters and fell into the "technical recession" of economists. Germany has temporarily survived the energy crisis in the winter in the past, but unable to stop the economy from continuing to decline.</p>
<p>After 2000, the German economy has experienced two economic contractions under the financial crisis and the new crisis. In 2009, the German economy fell 5.7%and fell 3.7%in 2020. Between the two crises, Germany has experienced ten years of economic prosperity. Today, under the strikes of the epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War, the German economy ushered in a dim prospective prospect.</p>

<h3>sex violence: exposed the behind -the -scenes of sexual assault on the website of sexual assault</h3>

<p>The filial son was sexually assaulted many times when he was teenage. She later launched the anti -"idiot" campaign, including the colorful badge. The badge reads: "‘ idiot ’is a crime!” People can express their attitudes towards “idiots” through wearing badges.</p>
<p><strong> Women who have encountered sexual assault on public transport in East Asia are also facing another risk: sexual assaults secretly shooting the indecent process and put the film on the Internet for sale. After more than a year of investigation, the BBC International Channel Survey Group "BBC's Eye" was undercover to expose behind the scenes of the scene through sexual violence. </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png" />In the early peak time in Tokyo, the train car was crowded and shaking.</p>
<p>The 15 -year -old filial piety (pseudonym) is going to school, and she tries to hold the armrest in the car.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt that she touched her skirt with one hand. She thought someone accidentally hit her.</p>
<p>But the hand then grabbed her.</p>
<p>"At that time, I realized that I encountered 'idiots'," Xiaozi recalled.</p>
<p>The hand disappeared quickly in the crowd.</p>
<p>"I can't do anything," that day, Xiaozi cried to school.</p>
<p>It was the first time she was obscene on public transportation (Volkswagen Transport System), but after that, she repeatedly encountered sexual harassment on the train. On many nights, she washed her face with tears.</p>
<p>"I think my life has no hope."</p>
<p>Many women encounter obscenity in public places like filial piety. Some of them have to face another kind of infringement: the process of sexual assault is photographed, and the film is even sold online.</p>
<p>We found that three Chinese websites sold and produced thousands of sexual assault films.</p>
<p>Most of the films are exactly the same: a man shot and track a woman from the back. A few seconds later, he was obscene of the woman. The behavior of these men was hidden, and the victims did not seem to realize that they were being sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>After more than a year of investigation, we tracked behind the scenes behind this dark industry through sexual violence: a rock musician, a sociological graduate, and their cautious "leaders".</p>
<h3>"idiot": Japan's serious social problem</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130029682_train.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Tokyo's subway trains sometimes become abnormally crowded.</p>
<p>The filial son encountered obscenity on the train to school almost every day. Due to fear and shame, she did not speak up when the victim. But every night, she will cover her mouth with a towel, and repeatedly practice how to drink a degenerate sexual assault person in front of the mirror: "This person is a" idiot "!"</p>
<p>"Idiot" is Japanese, which refers to sexual assault occurred in public places, especially the "salty pig hand" behavior on public transport. The word is also used to describe the criminals who have made this obscene behavior.</p>
<p>"Idiot" criminals usually start in a crowded place, using the victims to do not want to make trouble in public. In Japan, speaking is too directly frank, it may be regarded as a rude performance.</p>
<p>There are thousands of cases arrested every year due to the "idiot" behavior. However, more such crimes have not been discovered and punished. Mental Health Expert Saito Zhang Jia wrote a book about "idiot". He believes that only about 10 % of the victims will report to the police such crimes.</p>
<p>The Japanese police encouraged the victims and witnesses to speak, but the crime was far from being eradicated. The British and Canadian governments even reminded their citizens who are about to go to Japan to prevent them from "idiots".</p>
<p>Commodities and services with the theme of "idiots" are ubiquitous in the Japanese adult entertainment industry, and people are gradually accustomed to them. Adult films of "idiot" theme are one of the most popular pornographic films in Japan, and these films have also been spread to other countries in Asia.</p>
<p>In the Chinese world, the word "idiot" is becoming more and more widely known. In recent years, the crime of "salty pig hands" similar to "idiot" has also occurred.</p>
<h3>"idiot" website</h3>
<p>A Chinese website called "can't stand" caught our attention.</p>
<p>This website sells real "idiots" obscenity short films. These films are filmed with mobile phones. The location is usually in public places where people are crowded, such as subways and buses. The film is filmed in East Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Most of the films are shot in mainland China.</p>
<p>On this website, some short films are sold at a price of RMB. The website even allows users to customize sexual assaults.</p>
<p>We found two related sites on "unable to hold": "street shooting" and "idiot club", both selling the same type of film.</p>
<p>The website also has a Telegram group, with 4,000 members to share sexual assault skills in it.</p>
<p>A name has repeatedly appeared on these "idiots" websites: "Uncle Qi".</p>
<p>He was called "Great God" by the people in this community. There are no dozens of sexual assault films he signed. On Twitter, he publicly published a preview of website films, and there were more than 80,000 fans. But who is "Uncle Qi"?</p>
<p>We observed silently in that telegram group and found a clue. One day, a administrator sent several information, claiming that he had sex with a woman with "Uncle Qi".</p>
<p>He also posted a few photos, and there was a woman standing in a place that looked like a subway platform.</p>
<p>Within a few hours, we found this place: Ikebukuro Station in Tokyo.</p>
<p>There are more clues to bring us to Japan.</p>
<p>There is a PayPal account on the "Can't Hold", which is charged for yen payment. We found the registered mailbox of this account. When we entered the mailbox in the Google contact person, the displayed user avatar was a young man with exquisite makeup and exaggerated shapes.</p>
<p>Through reverse search, we found the man in the photo. His name is NOCTIS ZANG (Zang Xinyu), a 30 -year -old Chinese musician. He lived in Tokyo and was the lead singer of a heavy metal band called "TheVersus".</p>

<p>Through reverse search, we found the man in the photo. His name is NOCTIS ZANG (Zang Xinyu), a 30 -year -old Chinese musician (the picture shows Noctis Zang's Facebook picture).</p>
<p>NOCTIS's public image is bright, but we soon discovered that it was Jinyu Qi.The photographer also posted some laptop photos, including some accounting accounts and notes similar to the category of website videos. He said these notes were written by Noctis. He also released a video, which seemed to be a NOCTIS web browsing record, including the "idiot club" and "street shooting" pages, as well as the "unable to top" management center.</p>
<p>Is this rock musician might be "Uncle Qi"?</p>
<h3>website administrator</h3>
<p>Our undercover reporter "Ian" contacted NOCTIS as a music agent and asked him to meet in a high -end rooftop bar in Tokyo.</p>
<p>They talked about music first, but the topic slowly turned. When Ian said his company had made adult movies before, NOCTIS seemed interested.</p>
<p>The two of them met many times and celebrated NOCTIS's birthday together.</p>
<p>NOCTIS introduced Ian to know his band member Lupus. Lupus is also a Chinese, and he studied sociology in Japan before.</p>
<p>Ian said his company plans to invest in pornographic websites in Japan, and he asked them if they had contacted the business.</p>
<p>NOCTIS frankly said that he had "a little contact a little bit" before. His friend "Cat" founded his pornographic website and sold the "niche content" related to "subway" on it.</p>
<p>IAN lightly mentioned the website "Can't Top Top".</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Our undercover reporter Ian met with key figures related to one of the personal assault movies in a bar in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Lupus and Noctis laughed at the same time, and they replied, "That's a" cat "website!"</p>
<p>They revealed that the behind -the -scenes of the three "idiots" websites were a Chinese who was a "cat" and in Tokyo. According to them, the "cat" has a weird personality and suspicious paranoia.</p>
<p>NOCTIS and Lupus also admit that they have served as administrators for these websites.</p>
<p>They talk about the business model of the website. "China is the most depressed place," Noctis said. "Some men are psychologically perverted, and they want to see these women's quilt." Lupus took over the stubble: "Det."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130029685_cp_nuctus-lupus3.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Photos of NOCTIS and Lupus by BBC reporters undercover.</p>
<p>Noctis revealed that he uploaded more than 5,000 films for the website. He was also responsible for receiving money for the website. He took 30%of the commission and transferred the remaining income to "cat".</p>
<p>Lupus said he was responsible for promoting sexual assault on Twitter. He also said that he could help introduce Ian to know "cats".</p>
<h3>"idiot" club</h3>
<p>In a quiet back alley in Yokohama, Japan, a store decorated into a subway station is very eye -catching. The sign of the door summarizes the concept of this custom store: "legal 'idiot' train."</p>
<p>In this custom store called "peak time", customers can pay the experience of "idiots" legal.</p>
<p>Lian Xiuping, the manager of the store, welcomes us to "get on the car". "We let people do what they can't do outside. This is why they patronize here."</p>
<p>The shop is filled with clean and greasy taste. The private room is decorated as a train carriage, and the sound system can play the sound of the subway station. Even the member card in the store is exactly the same as the Japanese traffic card.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130010615_chikan_japan_19.jpg" />Image source, noriko hayashi</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The "Peak Moment" Sexual Club is decorated like a train car, providing customers with the opportunity to realize the fantasy of public sex.</p>
<p>"I think men are necessary to vent in such a place, so that they can avoid rape," Mr. Lian Tian said.</p>
<p>But Japanese mental health expert Saito Zhangjia said that sexual crimes are not as simple as sexual desire.</p>
<p>He said that the desire to control women has driven most of the sexual criminals to commit crimes.</p>
<p>"They do not treat their victims as equal people, but materialize them," Said Saito Zhang Jia said.</p>
<p>After a year of sexual assault, the filial son decided to fight back one day.</p>
<p>In the crowded carriage, she felt that a hand reached into her skirt, and she immediately shouted: "This person is a" idiot "!" She grabbed the wrist of sexual assaults and gave him to the police.</p>
<p>The filial son finally brought the man to court, but he was only sentenced to probation, although he had been arrested many times before because of "idiot".</p>
<p>Xiaozi was disappointed with the results of the case. She began to carry out the anti -"idiot" campaign, including the colorful badge. The badge reads: "‘ idiot ’is a crime!” People can express their attitudes towards “idiots” through wearing badges.</p>
<p>"This is a warning for the offender," Xiaozi said. She is now 24 years old. The anti -"idiot" movement she supports has gradually grown. Now Japan has an annual anti -"idiot" badge design competition to open to high school students across the country.</p>
<h3>hamster</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130010618_chikan_japan_nh_17.jpg" />Image source, noriko hayashi</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Activists make anti -"idiot" badges to improve the public's understanding of sexual assault incidents on public transport.</p>
<p>According to Lupus, the character of "cat" is like hamsters.</p>
<p>"Human and animals are harmless, but be careful about everything, and sometimes it is easy to be excited."</p>
<p>Lupus is right. "Cat" repeatedly refused to meet Ian.</p>
<p>But on New Year's Eve in the Lunar New Year, our luck suddenly came. "Cat" agreed to meet at a karaoke club in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The club is filled with a strong smell of smoke. Some people sing Chinese popular songs, and the sound of guests touch the cup.</p>
<p>Those who come to the appointment are unexpected. It was a thin young man, wearing half -edged glasses, wearing a dark long trench coat. "Cat" looks like a college student. He said he was 27 years old.</p>
<p>Ian showed his interest in investing in the "Cat" website and asked him how the income of this business was.</p>
<p>"Our turnover is about 5,000 to 100,000 (RMB) per day," "Cat" proudly, and still showing the transaction details on mobile phones. "The amount is very stable."</p>
<p>Ian pretended to admire and mentioned the name "Uncle Qi".</p>
<p>"Cat" immediately admitted: "I am Uncle Qi."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-08T05-32-28.000Z/_130029689_cp_maomi4.jpg" />Image adding text,But what surprised us was that he also revealed that "Uncle Qi" was not just a person.</p>
<p>"Cat" manages a 15 -person team, of which 10 of them produced a film in China under the name "Uncle Qi". Every month, "cats" received 30 to 100 pieces from them.</p>
<p>These films were immediately sold on three "idiots" websites, and "cats" acknowledged that he was the owner of these websites. There are more than 10,000 paid members on the website, most of which are Chinese men.</p>
<p>"The most important thing must be true, and it must be true," "Cat" said. He later told us that his website even sold real rape films.</p>
<p>When talking about his business, "cat" is like talking about a startup startup. He described his team "very hot" and "dare to go to break". He even said lightly that he was training other people to perform sexual assaults and shoot movies in public places.</p>
<p>But one thing he never mentioned: those women in his film seem to be worthless for him.</p>
<h3>Demonstrate "Cat"</h3>
<p>We want to know the true identity of "cat". Ian met with "cat" again, and he revealed how he first came into contact with the industry.</p>
<p>Like many boys, "cats" liked Superman, Anime and Games when they were young. But when he was 14 years old, he started watching sexual assault on the Internet, and the content inside was not far from the films he was selling.</p>
<p>He knew that this business was not risky.</p>
<p>"Do you know why I am so cautious and only let myself operate? Because I can do it for so long, it is always safety first." In order to avoid the investigation of Chinese law enforcement agencies, he plans to join the Japanese nationality.</p>
<p>Although "cat" was so cautious, he made a mistake.</p>
<p>When Ian asked where to transfer the investment funds, the "cat" took out his bank card from his wallet and handed it to Ian.</p>
<p>There is his real name on the card: Tang Zhuoran (transliteration).</p>
<p>After that, we found his address in Tokyo and proposed our allegations to "cats".</p>
<p>When we approached him, he did not answer our inquiries, and tried to cover his face and walk in other directions. Then, he suddenly started to attack the camera and the BBC team.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, we saw "cats" at the airport the next day. He left Japan.</p>
<p>The Twitter account of "Uncle Qi" is still active, and it is still publicly promoting sexual assault. Twitter did not respond to our comment request. They only sent us a symbol of stool, which is an automatic reply from Twitter News mailboxes since March this year.</p>
<p>We put forward our allegations to NOCTIS and Lupus. They did not respond. During the reporting production, we learned that the two no longer cooperated with "cats".</p>
<p>On a gentle spring day, we reunited with filial piety and shared our investigations with her.</p>
<p>She was shocked. She said: "Our women are just the content of the film that satisfies their desire to them. They materialize us. They don't think we are living people."</p>
<p>Xiaozi advocated more severe laws to crack down on these crimes.</p>
<p>Japan is about to pass the first pushing method, which will prohibit films and photos containing sexual exploitation content without the consent. Actors are advocating the introduction of laws that severely punish "idiots".</p>
<p>Before that, filial piety would not give up lightly. "We won't cry and fall asleep."</p>

<p>In this regard, the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense said on the evening of the 8th that the report was "speculation", which said that it had nothing to know about the relevant content.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded on the same day that the principle of "one China" is the political basis of China -US, China and Japan relations. China opposes that the establishment of diplomatic relations with the establishment of diplomatic relations with Taiwan has any forms of military connection with Taiwan and requires relevant countries to "do not make the Taiwan Strait's tension factors." Otherwise, the Chinese side will be firm Maintain your sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>According to the Financial Times, in early 2025, the US defense contractor "General Atomics" will deliver 4 MQ-9B "Seaguardian" drones to Taipei for the US "MQ-9 Death Reconnament" for the United States The sea modification.

<p>The Financial Times pointed out that the Pentagon and the Presidential Palace of Taiwan have refused to comment on the matter.</p>
<h3>Experts: Improved Political Mutual Trust of the United States, Japan and Taiwan</h3>
<p>Su Ziyun, director of the National Defense Strategy and Resources Research Institute of the Taiwan National Defense Council, told DW that he believed that the matter had a certain degree of credibility. In addition to obtaining the news many times in the past, the current international situation has indeed allowed the United States and Japan to share no one to share no one. The airfield intelligence is "operable".</p>
<p>He pointed out that in May, the United States stated that it would assist Taiwan to obtain NATO LINK-22 data chain system technology and carry out military upgrades. Then, the three-party shared drone instant data reported by this time, observed that they have cooperated with each other and have a technical and political level. Su Ziyun said that the incident showed that the political mutual trust of the United States and Japan was improved.</p>
<p>Link-22 is a military strategic data contact system. Su Ziyun explained that its "the most important function is to integrate this kind of sensor, radar, and warships." Let the objects of shared information be seen in the intelligence images collected to each other to enhance the management capabilities of the battlefield.

The steps to greatly improve the efficiency of information sharing.</p>
<p>Su Ziyun told DW that the drone plays the role of "terminal" and is responsible for collecting about 200 to 300 kilometers of sea intelligence in the surrounding area of its flight. These emotional funds are shared with allies through Link-22 and other communication networks. For example, the current radar in Taiwan can detect about information within about 300 to 400 kilometers around. If the allies' drone sharing information is added, "it is equivalent to the coverage of the original 400 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers. , Or even 1500 kilometers ", forming a" General Combat Map "liaison network that can play an early warning effectiveness can not only make the battlefield management capabilities among the allies more complete, but also make Taiwan's firepower and troops more effective.</p>
<h3>Not only relying on the US military fire Taiwan to strengthen the defense capabilities</h3>

<p>Although the Michelin tire full mascot was discovered by the majority of netizens when the Hangzhou Restaurant Guide was announced, but this Bible in the global gourmet industry in 123 years has not been given. Essence Michelin's Red Book was born in 1900, while the first star restaurant in Michelin appeared in France was in 1926. Coincidentally, after reading history, I saw Hangzhou drama that originated in Hangzhou 100 years ago. It officially took shape in 1923 and started a business performance.</p>
<p>In 100 years, it is only about 40 years with the food life talked about today. Since the reform and opening up, the individual private economy has broken the deadlock of the planned economy in many places in many places, and truly entered a market economy with a broad concept. From the initial government organization to sell breakfast for the citizens, but foreign workers successfully solved the problem of urban breakfast through individual breakfast stalls. From the explicit text of the business management department, the size of the restaurant dishes, and no consumers have complained why there are only a small food in the plate in the plate today, without him, just to set up the plate. From the initial price limit of certain dishes, even stipulated that only four dishes and one soup can be eaten, to a unknown mysterious Arab prince in a restaurant in Shanghai, a luncheon of 200,000 yuan. eat. All these changes must thank the impact of the invisible hands of the market economy.</p>
<p>The catering market of nearly 5 trillion yuan per year is also completely consumers' own choice. Although the high -end restaurants in Shanghai have begun to appear 50 % off promotional package, there are too many seats and too little buttocks in the market, indicating that your favorite high -end restaurant is changing quietly.</p>
<p>The 40 years of China's Catering Turburning Development, which has happened to the 40 years from the beginning of global integration from the beginning to leaflets. The global integration itself is also the process of exporting cultural values in backward areas in developed regions. In this long process, catering practitioners in the underwriting area will slowly throw away the old tradition of the year and enter the tide of rapid expansion of gold rush, and after the traditional culture encounters the baptism of globalization, it has it. The taste and form of pursuit, the pursuit of the decoration style, or the decoration style of the store are slowly eliminated by the emerging trend.</p>
<p>Because the way of survival in the market has changed fundamentally, the traditional old -fashioned living habits pursued by the wealthy businessmen are replaced by the fast -paced living habits of young people. A large number of young people who are eager for wealthy people have poured into large -scale economic cities from remote rural or county seats, because they can only have more opportunities for young people in such a large city. You can make money where you can make money, and there will be more young people. This is almost the direction of the flow of people in the past. After the taste of light people became mainstream, those traditional and elegant tastes slowly retreated. Although it still exists, it is already non -mainstream. Compared with the so -called faint taste of the Hong Kong Rich Dining, the various fun tastes that young people like today, and the taste of all kinds of food has long been on the other side.</p>
<p>In front of me, there are two "Guidelines for Hong Kong Macau in 2008" and "Michelin Guide in 2022", known as the Hong Kong Macau Michelin. In 2008, when the Michelin Guide was released in the Chinese market for the first time, the local official name was "Michelian" in Hong Kong and Macao. After the publishing of the Michelin Guide in 2022, the Michelin Guide of the paper officially withdrawn from the historical stage. This time the Hangzhou Michelin Guide has fully realized the presentation of paperless mobile apps, which is also a manifestation of the food guide in the Internet era. The Chinese Internet capital, known for its popularity and distribution of traffic, did not appear in the Hangzhou Michelin Guide. There were no expectations of two -star restaurants and Samsung restaurants. And 33 Michelin selected restaurants formed the list of Hangzhou Michelin Guide in 2023. The disappointment of the circle of friends is like the first Michelin guide in Guangzhou at that time. People always feel that eating in Guangzhou, how can there be a Michelin Samsung, but not.</p>
<p>How to treat the Michelin guide correctly and fairly is always a topic that food lovers like to discuss. Especially when the tire baby appeared in a certain city for the first time, it was definitely a big discussion in the food enthusiast group. However, the Michelin Guide is considered to be ruthless and very opaque, as if it is out of touch with this era. Even the most mysterious US Central Intelligence Agency will decrypt some historical documents at the time after 50 years of historical events, but the Michelin Guide with 123 years of history has never been announced by any food report written by their gourmet detectives. Essence They will not even tell the restaurants and consumers even the reasons for giving lower scores. In addition to introducing some special dishes and a series of prices, the restaurant's rating is based on the stars and a series of knife and fork tableware patterns. Describe the level of service and atmosphere. How many foods in the world work in the Michelin Guide, even more difficult than asking how many beauties in the Arabia harem. But is more of the gourmet list of social media, and is it really so good to promote their gourmet selection experts? The answer is obviously benevolent. After all, it is still necessary to get to know each other, but there are more things that Lixia's hearts in front of melon. The judges blended with the brand's gold master father privately, and the public will slowly feel that the gold content is reduced.</p>
<p>There is a less appropriate metaphor, as if the international capital market has a higher degree of trust in Moody's, S &amp; P, or Fitch International, but if it is a domestic capital market, everyone is in good faith, Pengyuan Credit, or United Credit Credit. It will also be favored by domestic credit rating agencies. In terms of catering authority, the food guide still depends on the influential audience. Is it aimed at global tourists or local tourists. Relying on the world's 140 Michelin Samsung chefs and 16,000 restaurants in the world, Michelin has established a gourmet list of global restaurants and chefs in the world. What benefits can the stars of the Michelin guide get? Borrowing from the 31 stars, the famous French chef Joelrobuchon's evaluation of the Michelin Guide in 2017, "Get a Michelin star, your restaurant business will increase by about 20%, get two stars, your business will increase by 40%. Get three stars, your business will increase by about 100%. "So when the French began to hold a food guide conference for a certain city worldwide, the tourism promotion institutions of those cities that were qualified for qualifications were very clear. Ready to welcome guests around the world.Of course, in the era of decentralization of the Internet, even if it is a gourmet list, there are Meituan and Ctrip in China, internationally with TripAdvisor and Yelp, which does not include Google, a network giant specializing in search engines. And the byte beating in the country and the overseas TIKTOK, through the way of destructive presentation of short videos, began to enter such vertical fields like rowing mountains and sea. , Buying books and beauty services have established very loyal user communities. The process of evaluating a restaurant through short videos seems to be more transparent and authentic. Most consumers will feel that everyone can become a food expert similar to Michelin food dense detection, but the omnipotent algorithm hidden behind the huge traffic is the omnipresent algorithm. Will we really believe that the browsing data on social media collected by computer programs is more fair? The time, place, weather, seasons we appear in the restaurant, as well as the price, quantity of our care, or the cycle we posted videos, and then more likes from friends, family members, and netizens who have never met Massive personal user reviews and more real -time data point consumption amounts, as well as the historical records and satisfaction evaluation of online shopping, and the data that the artificial intelligence needs to be known in the background clearly in the background Essence Then these data were all analyzed by artificial intelligence to push us all kinds of attention lists or play lists, and the praise videos of the person you follow. Can we find a restaurant that makes us very satisfied?</p>
<p>For the first Michelin guide in Hangzhou, we are very curious about which city of Michelin's next stop will be in China. Regarding this issue, I and Michelin's international director, Frenchman GWENDALPOULLENEC exchanged my opinion. The spokesperson of the global gourmet culture joined the Michelin's map and guidelines in France in 2004. Ten years later, due to the active performance in the digital transformation of Michelin, he became the secretary -general of the Michelin Guide and replaced in 2018 to replace it in 2018. Michaelellis is an international director. In the fall of 2018, Michelin announced the acquisition of Tablethotels, a professional service agency specializing in the selection and recommendation of boutique hotels. In 2019, the Robert Parker WineAdvocate wine guide, which was originally held 40%of the previous shares in 2017, became 100 %Of Michelin owned. These two acquisitions are considered to help consolidate the leading position and international influence of Michelin in the hotel industry and the restaurant industry and the alcoholics industry. I think the next stop of Michelin should be Shenzhen, the most important city in the Greater Bay Area, because every time Michelin chose a new city, it usually considers the city's catering quality and the influence of this city. These are closely related to exquisite dining. He wouldn't have any guessing.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-56-52-00-00/000183364_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Apple's VISION PRO product release has caused collective cheers in the Chinese science and technology community. Indeed, we need good news under the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Most people think that this Apple product has created a revolutionary user experience and opened a new growth space for the global technology industry; many big coffees and executives in China's smartphone industry have fully affirmed this. Some It is believed that "Apple directly answered many brands to explore how many years of AR/VR/MR/XR products are the category problem: Space Computing Platform". This industry's perspective is very accurate. Of course, it is also an important affirmation of Apple's new products.</p>
<p>If we seek the technical details behind VisionPro, we may deepen this impression. Simple listing three points. First, industry experts expect that the delay of Apple VR is 22 milliseconds, but Apple's release has achieved 12 milliseconds, which will definitely greatly reduce the sense of dizziness. The leading difference may reach 2-3 generations; third, Apple has opened up the connection with Facetime through VisionPro, and realizes seamless connections with products such as iPhone and Apple TV, making Apple more powerful.</p>
<p>It should be said that the above high evaluation, in terms of reality and logic, both agrees that VisionPro is a high -level product carefully polished by Apple. The cutting -edge attempt of the universe innovation. "Who will be the ultimate challenger of Apple's high -end machines in December 2022 FT Chinese website in December 2022? In the ", the essence of Apple's strategy is" productism "superimposed the" revolutionary ecosystem ", which has always been highly evaluated by Apple's strategic stability. However, we think about it from another angle and can't help but ask: Does VisionPro surpass the previously established Apple strategic pattern? Obviously, no.</p>
<p>Therefore, this article will provide a new perspective to evaluate Apple. From Apple's market value growth expectations and comparison of Tesla's two perspectives, at the moment when Apple's market value creates a historic high, we will re -torture its long -term value: Is Apple's historic stock price in highlights? Will Apple's market value be surpassed by Tesla in the future?</p>
<p>However, if we change the coordinate system to look at the apple, there is indeed a perfect negative expectation. What needs to be reminded is that the reality is perfect and the expected imperfection is indeed possible. From a critical perspective, as a global innovation leader in the mobile phone industry, the Apple does not subversive, and the fundamental logic of the Vision PRO product concept is disappointing:</p>
<p>First, great products must respond to the call of the times, not just an extension of its own business value. In today's world, Apple's level of global innovation leaders must answer the profound questions faced by several humans in today's world, including: How can the subjective value of humans in the era of human -computer intelligence be reflected? Facing the relationship between humans and nature threatening extreme climate? How is the new scene switching of personal productivity and social productivity? In other words, although Apple's VR products have expanded people's vision, this is just a natural business response from the perspective of the refined and self -reliance of the mobile phone industry. Compared with the mission and value proposition that great companies should have, this product is obviously used as a product as a product as a product. Revolutionary innovative new products have not completed such mission. To put it simply, Apple's new products have not fully answered the major propositions of "how human life live in the future". Of course, this is also based on high -expected high standards.</p>
<p>Second, Apple VisionPro highlights more visual experience, but does not introduce more physical and natural world interaction logic. Although VR is not an AR nor the XR somatosensory device, it should be so positioned in itself, and it is understandable. However, from the perspective of commercial expansion space, improving human vision as a comprehensive and extreme experience is only part of them. Compared with human and external world interactions in AR experience, and many human behavior in XR devices AI and digitalization, visual experience, visual experience, visual experience, visual experience, visual experience, visual experience. Evolution is not a big logic, but a small logic. Even if this small logic is magnified several times, it objectively makes Apple's vision deeper into the traditional consumer electronics traditional pattern. Here, we judge that this product may start research and development 3-5 years ago and continuously optimize technical parameters, but innovative thinking continues the relatively old concepts before.</p>
<p>Third, from the current experience of Apple VISIONPRO in the application Facetime and other experiences, in addition to connecting Apple ecological applications and display visual amplification effects, Apple VR applications are still poor. In other words, for a long time along this route, VisionPro may not have much application -level innovation, but only add some content. Perhaps there is a space for entertainment, medical and long -range education, but not ready to be super super super -ready. Application and other blessings. Therefore, from this perspective, Apple's VR products still need to be polished multiple times, especially a large explosion phase of iTunes-level application. Then roughly estimate that according to Apple's current technical route, it takes 5-10 years to achieve this mission. VisionPro may be more than 5 years to support Apple's market value amplification.</p>
<p>Fourth, "space calculation" is a non -core pain point for hardware. In the future, this role may be more weakened through the large model of the Yuan universe. The hardware space calculation should not be able to talk about subversive innovation. Of course, this also explains why the stock price fell sharply after the release of Apple VisionPro, but the Yuandi software company such as Unity has skyrocketed. In addition to the favorable cooperation with Apple, the most important signal is that the demand for building 3D space content has been amplified.</p>
<p>In other words, Apple VISIONPRO is the most important product of Apple in the past three years. We can also be very good from various technical parameters. It can even be confirmed that this is a good product, but Apple is currently the world's market value first (US $ 2.8 trillion) Innovative technology companies, obviously this level of achievement is not enough to support the continuous growth of market value in the next 3-5 years. But from another perspective, Apple's current imagination is lacking just to bring a historic opportunity to the Chinese smartphone industry. If you can use the Android system to launch a revolutionary Yuan cosmic entrance product, the higher cost performance should reach the industry period The long -awaited curve overtaking is not just a question of a technical parameter, but also a problem of strategic forward -looking and imagination.However, with the recovery of Nasdaq, and Musk gave up Twitter's management to return to Tesla, Cybertruck (electric pickup), FSD (fully autonomous driving), Megapack (energy storage), Teslaoptimus (robot) The technical route gradually became clear, and the Aura in interstellar exploration related to SpaceX related to Musk, the Neuralink (brain machine interface) technology began to apply, and even SpaceLink (Star Chain) began to emerge in the Russia and Ukraine War. Tesla and its founding The new human civilization of Musk is starting to give the world's new scientific and technological innovation incentives. Its commercial value has gradually begun to explode:</p>
<p>Cybertruck electric pickup: This car appeared in November 2019, has been polished for 4 years, and began to be close to mass production delivery in 2023. At present, the order volume has exceeded 1.5 million units. In 2021, the US pickup market is a huge and continuous market. According to Statista data, the sales volume of American light trucks (including pickups) in 2020 was about 1.246 million. Compared with these two numbers, it can be seen that Tesla's electric pickup card has become a leading brand in the industry.</p>
<p>FSD (fully autonomous driving): MCKINSEY &amp; Company pointed out in its report that by 2030, the market potential of global autonomous vehicles and related services may reach $ 1.7 trillion. According to the analysis of the market research company IDTeChex, by 2030, the global electric vehicle market is expected to exceed 1.5 trillion US dollars. This includes various electric models such as electric cars, electric SUVs, electric pickups. In a less accurate contrast, the market value of Tesla FSD may even surpass the market value of the global electric vehicle industry. At least these professional data research has this possibility. From a strategic logic point of view, Tesla completely changed the low -hairy operating model of the automotive industry through hardware innovation before, making smart electric vehicles a real banknote printing industry.</p>
<p>TESLALALALITHIUM (Lithium Mine Refining): The Tesla Lithium Mine Refining Project Factory released in April 2023 has broken ground and plans to invest 375 million U.S. dollars. Essence Musk expects that this plant will provide a lithium for about 1 million vehicles.(The plant)The production of car -grade lithium is more than the sum of other North American manufacturers. As we all know, at present, Tesla Motors still maintain a gross profit margin of more than 20%, which is the highest profit margin among all smart cars, and the most important point in this is lithium batteries. A variety of raw materials, including lithium, constitute 80%of the cost of power batteries. The breakthrough of this project is almost equivalent to Tesla's another banknote printing machine.</p>
<p>MEGAPACK (Energy Storage): On April 9, Tesla announced that it would build a new energy storage super factory in Shanghai to produce Tesla super large commercial energy storage batteries. According to reports, the energy storage plant is planned to start in the third quarter of 2023 and put into production in the second quarter of 2024. The initial planned annual commercial energy storage battery was planned for 10,000 units, and the energy storage scale was nearly 40 GWH (GWH). Judging from Tesla's announcement, each MEGAPACK battery can store more than 3MWH energy to meet the one -hour electricity demand for 3,600 households. At present, the Tesla Megapack battery has provided new energy for the development of new energy for the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other places. This also means that Tesla is becoming an innovative era of China Power Grid Corporation+Global Energy Storage Industry, and has a larger global operating scale potential.</p>
<p>TESLAOPTIMUS: The industry predicts that the large -scale production foundation of Tesla's smart car may allow Tesla robotics to reach millions of units in the next 10 years, and the price will be much cheaper than cars. It may be less than 20,000 The US dollar is expected to be delivered within 3-5 years. However, its manufacturing cost may be only $ 5,000, and FSD's intelligent technology can be used directly to quickly obtain intelligent capabilities. Even an exaggerated evaluation in the industry said that Tesla robotic hand ability can make it the only robot in the world that can make Tesla robots.</p>
<p>If we summarize the entire strategic pattern of Tesla or above, we will find that Tesla's strategic pattern can be included: 10 times the commercial space of Apple smartphones (simple reference: data shows that the automotive industry is 10 times more than smart phones), A quasi -monopolyman of the autonomous driving market that is similar to the entire smart automobile industry, a LG chemical -level lithium refinement company, a new era global Mobil oil plus national power grid, plus the current speculation may be 10 times more than smart electric The automotive industry is very likely to be the robotic industry in the history of human industry. Judging from this pattern, it is not the most important question for Tesla electric vehicles to make a profit and whether it has become the first in the industry. This is the greatest dream in the history of human industry.</p>

<p>I resigned naked, temporarily, on the first day of work after the new year.</p>
<p>On the first day of work, I held a pen and pen in the leadership office. After taking a week of work, I found that there were 8 items, so I started to plan. Time, I want to talk to you about work. "At this time, the voice of my heart is: This is the end of this XX class.</p>
<p>At the moment when he resigned, the leader was a little shocked. After all, this job was considered a nominal "iron rice bowl". The salary and the corresponding workload were considered considerable as Beijing's standards. Perhaps from the perspective of the leader, I have no reason to resign. For a while with the leader, he attached the grand excuses of "I want to take the exam", and finally successfully resigned the resignation process. After half a month, I officially signed the resignation agreement as a free person to "live in a residence. "in Beijing.</p>
<p>When I decided to naked, I already knew that I would no longer be engaged in this "office work" in a short time. I want to explore other possibilities of life. The confusion in the future still exists. On the one hand, I am 30 years old. I think life should not be just spent in the cycle of "work, get off work, work and get off work"; on the other hand, without work, it is bound to bring survival anxiety. Therefore, the first thing after nakedness is to take stock of their deposits. There is no "mine" in the family to inherit. Five -digit deposits can barely support the year of life. I can't bear a little accident. Fortunately, it is naturally optimistic. The brain automatically removes all negative information, and even social security and medical insurance are not paid. I just have to go to a life without an accident.</p>
<p><strong> Full meal is the first important righteousness of life </strong></p>
<p>The first thing to solve is to eat and live in Beijing, which is the biggest part of the overall expenditure. I chose to live in a friend's house with no money. Responsible for our monthly hydropower costs. I usually do it by myself, save money and healthy, so that the overall expenditure of eating and accommodation is controlled at about 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>In order to get some additional income, I started to do part -time ideas. I have two needs for part -time jobs. One is that the daily working hours should not be too long, and the working hours can be adjusted flexibly. The second is that "light physical labor" is needed. For too long, brainpower labor has eliminated my interest in work, and light physical labor can also meet fitness needs. As for the salary, I know that part -time salary is not high, so I don't expect much expectations.</p>
<p>Based on the above needs, I quickly found a part -time job in a bookstore, but it became a waiter in the coffee shop in the bookstore. The coffee shop has a free working hours, and of course the salary is also very low. My salary is 18 yuan/h. Therefore, at that time, 18 yuan/hour became a measurement unit for my life. I thought about the price for a few hours before ordering a takeaway and buying a fruit. Maybe with such a measure and comparison, I found that Beijing's prices are really high. There is no five insurances and one gold in part -time job. I adhering to the mentality of "small illness and dying", I have no insurance every day. In the conversation with other clerks, I learned that some of the full -time clerks were only about 3K, and they could only live in Beijing. If they were sick, living expenses even needed to help at home. Another shop where I worked after me, the clerk did not have five insurances and one gold, but they would also think that if the store paid five insurances and one fund, the salary was less.</p>
<p>I usually choose to work late, and I can leave after 5 hours. The work content is also simple, that is, coffee, cleaning the desktop hygiene, and answering the doubts of some guests. In my spare time, I can also read freely. In the months of working in a coffee shop, my reading has caught up with the past year. It can be seen that leisure is the first productive forces of reading.</p>
<p>The owner of the coffee shop and bookstore is a couple, which is a bit famous in the cultural field. The male boss is working in the bookstore every day, and the female boss came occasionally for a few days a week. Whenever the female boss comes, I think the air pressure between colleagues becomes very low, and at the same time, the expression starts to be nervous. It seems that no matter what you are doing, the boss seems to be dissatisfied. I always feel that you are lazy. Find something to do. For example, the coffee shop requires two people to work during the same period. The manager is part -time with a part -time job. Part -time jobs are mainly responsible for ordering, coffee, and cleaning. When there is no guest, part -time jobs generally need to stand in front of the computer to prepare, because once a guest suddenly enters the door, if part -time, if you do not stand in the bar, you need to take a large circle to go into the bar to give the guests to order for the time. However, because our head station was on the bar, the female boss felt unhappy, and criticized the shop chief several times, asking "why two people (including the store manager) are standing inside." The manager explained many times, but every time the boss came to the store, he always asked for a part -time job to wash the rags, wipe it.</p>
<p>The male boss's attitude towards employees is similar. I remember that once he was going to sell his bookmark name, the bookstore could not be tuned, and asked me to help. As a result, he only needed to sign 10 books, and my role was to help him take 10 books out of the box. When he signed the second book, he said, "You help me turn over the book, otherwise what do you want you to do?" I laughed dumbly, but I did it. When he signed in the 5th and 6th books, he suddenly looked up at me and said, "Can you not see it? Didn't I teach you all? You see, I will fold the title page like this." The tone made me very uncomfortable. He came immediately and said directly, "I am a coffee shop clerk, not a bookstore, I haven't done this." Afterwards, why the two bosses made me feel uncomfortable because they felt that they did not hold me in their tone and behavior. As a staff member, it always reminds me of the relationship between the landlord and the long -term worker in the literary works.</p>
<p>Being a waiter will encounter various customers. Some guests are very, very kind. A couple often came to drink coffee, and they were very polite to our waiters. They always hung "thank you" and "hard work" to my mouth, making me feel like they met with them for a long time. Some guests are completely opposite. For example, a beard man always comes at night, come in and sit down without ordering. When we go to ask, the discourse has not finished, and he doesn’t lift his head. One sentence: "American." There are also guests who blame us why we do not remind the membership cards to discount, but the slogans that can be discounted obviously are posted on the bar. Some people will propose all kinds of dissatisfaction, but I generally don't be more true. Per attention will pass. The more you confess, the easier they are. I am afraid that the situation will develop into a "part -time clerk beating customers and being fired" ascended to social news. (This is a joke.)</p>
<p>After working hard in the coffee shop for three months, freshness passed, and repeated labor made me start to get tired. When I just did this kind of physical work, I went to work every day, leaped to work underground, jumped alive, and the brain did get a brief relaxation. There is no need to "engravrate the carved flowers". Trouble, there is no job message after work, you need to reply, and you will not think about and outline the work task the next day before going to bed.It happened that "naked words" and "light physical work" have recently become hot spots. I also pay attention to many people who have naked and high -paying work to do physical work and self -media, showing the beauty and relaxation of light physical work. After these four months, I think it is time to shatter the filter of light -fitting. The ideals and beauty of coffee shops, flower shops, pet shops, baking shops and other industries are not universally shown on the workers. Physical work does not mean freedom, no competition, no pressure, and not tired, but it will cause difficulties in life because of low salary. After I left the coffee shop, I went to the bakery and found that there are some common points in the so -called light physical work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not as free as expected. Even if you are a part-time waiter, you need to work 5-6 days a week, and work at least 5 hours a day (the requirements of different stores are different). You need to go to get off work on time. Holidays are usually the busiest time in the store. The clerk does not have a holiday on holidays, and there are no salary of three times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are certain requirements for physical strength. Light physical work generally requires operations or running back and forth, which will be tired. You need you to have a good physique, especially the waist and legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work benefits are basically zero. Most of them do not have five insurances and one gold. If needed, you have to pay it yourself. As far as I know, some shop owners provide employee dormitories, but the posts that provide accommodation will lower their wages to a certain extent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always take on some extra work. For example, I was originally a waiter in the coffee shop, but as long as the bookstore owner is happy, I have to wipe the screen, move the book, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a long time, it will really make young people feel boring. To a certain extent, physical work is "simple duplication". It is not necessary to think and change. It is also that you want to get off work as soon as you go to work every day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After experiencing this, I think work is work, don't look for meaning in work, and don't add any significance to work. Thinking about it in other places, if you were not a young white -collar worker who experienced life in order to escape the "shit work", but a really relying on this labor to make a living, the meaning of labor can only be to make money. Identity and time will change the nature of things. The cleansing aunt in the coffee shop worked for more than ten years in the store. She hoped that she could reduce labor time or, and the boss could open more salary for her.</p>
<p>Physical work is not the redemption of anyone. Eating full is the first essential of life.</p>
<p><strong> Is the East Asian people "intermediate rest"? </strong></p>
<p>I gave myself a year to exile myself. In this year, I can do nothing. I can become a waste in a secular sense. I can also try what I like to do. Because of a little deposit, I get relative freedom.</p>
<p>In the Japanese drama "Restarting Life" some time ago, the protagonist Mami continued to reborn to accumulate virtue in order to reincarnate. Before the birth, Mami asked the clerk: "So isn't it similar to the interval between midfielders?" The clerk replied: "We do not have a midfield rest."</p>
<p>In the months of Gap, I deeply appreciated the incident of "East Asian people without Gapyear". Big data push let me see a lot of posts about the plan of my naked resignation -entrepreneurship, examination certificate, and learning technology. As soon as I saw it, I made me dark, "Is this not as easy to go to work?" After I started GAP, because of the regular schedule and exercise, coupled with a healthy diet, my emotions became extremely stable. During the explosion. I successfully found part -time jobs in my favorite industry, and I also got a lot of attention from the media account. I encouraged other young people and earned a little advertising fee.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2019, I had a short unemployment for two months, when I was 26 years old. During that time, I would feel anxious, uneasy, urgent, and superstitious. I shared my unemployment experience on my public account. I wrote this passage:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-57-07-00-00/000183756_piclink.jpg" />Four years later, at this time I was 30 years old, and I was no longer afraid, helpless and anxious about "unemployment". Because I think clearly, no matter what I do, I can always live in this world, then I want to do a happy thing.</p>
<p>A game that recently played "Legend of Zelda" is said to have "re -activated" a lot of people. Players can choose to go to the main task in "Zelda" -to defeat the ultimate BOSS, rescue the princess, and create a peaceful world. The NPC encountered in the game will guide you to this road. It is also an open game. If you choose to run around, play mobs, pick fruit, and catch fish in the game, you can also harvest endless happiness. Monsters in the game, I know that when I can't beat it, I can choose to go quietly, just like the difficulties in life. Isn't it necessary to overcome it? Try to avoid it? There are many NPCs in the game, and some will recommend what players should do, and some are hypocritical enemies. I think that people encountered in real life can also be regarded as NPCs in life games. Maybe it is not important not to see them. Even interpersonal relationships are not necessarily necessary courses.</p>
<p>This is the significance conveyed by the Zelda series. Life is an open game. It needs to be continuously explored and created, not only one way. One opportunity, step by step.</p>
<p>I chose the latter between the main line of the princess and what I wanted, but I also understand that not everyone has to choose. Especially for people with economic burdens and family responsibilities, while panicing for unemployment and hate work, they are constantly being rubbed by two emotions, and even anxiety and depression are most silent norms. Some of the colleagues who work part -time jobs are amateur in the band, and some are preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination. I think the ability of many of them can find a better salary job. It is difficult for individuals to know how to solve the situation and do all the time, but they are looking for exports a little bit.</p>
<p>First of all, do not blame yourself.</p>
<p>If it is possible, you don't have to follow the game settings, try throwing away the social clock, and come to watch it yourself.</p>

<p>Many people are curious about the gallery but never lift their feet and enter. In the first place, unlike the humble posture of opening the door and welcome customers, the door of the gallery is often closed, so that you have to get the courage to push the door in order; You have a courage to ask again, get a "20,000" reply, and you are no longer embarrassed to ask which currency is.</p>
<p>"Hang up and sell" is the usual posture of the art market. For a long time, the artistic attitude carefully maintained the supreme status and the elusive price of the artist with this attitude.</p>
<p>But there are always people who do not play cards. For example: Will Ramsay, the founder of "Ranqi Contemporary Art Fair". The English of this art fair he founded was called "Affordable Artfair"(Lingly translated as "affordable art expo")There are two distinctive features: first, the price is transparent; second, there is a maximum price limit in various markets, and the top price of the Chinese exhibition is 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-57-52-00-00/000183533_piclink.jpg" />(Will Ramsay, the founder of the Contemporary Art Expo)</p>
<p>A small price label, easily removes the intangible obstacles between artworks and potential collectors who have not yet become artistic consumers.</p>
<p><strong> "Become a art collector, you don't need to be a rich" </strong> **</p>
<p>In 1999, Ranville founded the "Ranqi Contemporary Art Fair" in London. Now this art expo has settled in 11 cities around the world, including London, Brussels, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney, etc.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai already has the "Art 021", known as the people, the "West Coast Art Expo" known as the academicity, and the "Image Art Fair" focusing on the art of video art. Do you not think this market is crowded?</p>
<p>"Never!" Ranville said: "With the development of the Chinese economy and the improvement of the quality of life, the demand for art will be strongly improved, and everyone's taste is personalized. Friendly, we successfully held in Hong Kong for ten years, and also verified that Chinese collectors like this experience. We will welcome more art lovers in Shanghai to help them take the first step to become collectors. "</p>

<p>So, in addition to the price of transparent prices and the price of 100,000 yuan, compared with the Basel Art Expo and the Friz Art Fair, what are the other characteristics of "Ranqi Contemporary"?</p>
<p>"Basel and Friz Art Expo are relatively high -end, attracting blue chip trapees and mature collectors, and we want to create an environment where everyone can enjoy the art, and we can find the taste and budget of everyone's taste and budget here. Art. For the price of art, there is a misunderstanding that artworks are only the elite, but in fact you don't have to become a rich man to become a collector of art. "Ranville emphasized.</p>
<p><strong> How to ensure academicity? </strong></p>
<p>In the past 24 years, the Ranqi Contemporary Art Fair has attracted nearly 200,000 visitors worldwide every year, 40%of them purchased the first artwork of life and became new collectors.</p>
<p>As an entry -level art expo, facing large -scale potential collectors, how does "Ranqi Contemporary" ensure the academicity of the work while putting forward the price limit requirements? After all, if an art expo wants to have a long -term development, it will eventually speak by high reputation works.</p>
<p>One of the most successful artists excavated by "Ran Qi Contemporary" is Antonymicallef. His works are considered to review the new generation of consumerism and attract Angelina Jolie, Angelina Jolie, and cloth. Bradpitt and Christina Aguilera (Christina Aguilera)</p>
<p>Waiting for celebrities collectors. Michael's work is now as high as 300,000 pounds, but when he was sold at the "Ranqi Contemporary Art Fair" in Bartle Park, London, the price of the work was only about 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-57-52-00-00/000183535_piclink.jpg" />(The works of Antony Micallef (Antony Micallef, not this "Ranqi Contemporary" exhibits)</p>
<p>Regarding the exhibitors, Ranville explained: "Nine months before the opening of the exhibition, local and international galleries began to apply for exhibition. In addition, the jury consisting of professionals from the art industry will also evaluate the exhibitors to ensure the quality and diversity of the gallery. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-57-52-00-00/000183536_piclink.jpg" /> (Zhang Ding, "Amendment of Unlimited Collection#2", 2021, aluminum alloy board, UV printing pictures thanks to the artist)In fact, artists and galleries participating in the "Ranqi Contemporary" are not only young artists, but also works of artists who are famous in the contemporary art market: such as the installation of artist Zhang Ding. In addition, the curator You Yang, in the special project of the theme of "Star and River", focused on the representative potential of the graduates such as Chuanmei and Yangmei.</p>
<p><strong> "I want to break the barriers between art and ordinary people" </strong></p>
<p>"When the" Ranqi Contemporary "was created at first, my mission was to allow everyone to come into contact with art. I want to break the barriers between art and ordinary people, so that people have the opportunity to enjoy and collect art." Ranville said: "I also want people to realize that you don't need to be an expert or rich in order to buy art. Until today, this is still my mission."</p>

<p>Obviously Ranville's idea has achieved commercial success. Shanghai has become the 11th city where "Ranqi Contemporary" has settled in this year. In 2024, "Ranqi Contemporary" will land on Berlin and Austin, the capital of Texas, USA, to more ordinary people. Ranville said: "From our" humble 'to this day, the ‘Ranqi Contemporary’ welcome 3.1 million ginseng viewers. They bring 500,000 pieces of arts with a total value of $ 560 million back home.

<p>On October 27 this year, the Malagas Pacific Museum will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the opening. The 20th anniversary coincides with the 50th anniversary of Picasso's death. To this end, the Spanish and the French government joined hands to celebrate the status and influence of Picasso in art history. The Marakasas Museum for this "Double Jubilee" launched Spain's first large -scale exhibition "Sculptor Picasso material and body" in May this year(Picasso sculptor. Matter and body)In early October, the works of 30 contemporary artists will also talk to Picasso dialogue "Echo Picasso"(Picasso's echo)Essence</p>
<p>There are 5 Picasso Museum in Europe, of which Paris is the largest and most important. However, Antibes, located in the Mediterranean coast of southeastern France, was the first museum converted by Chilagrimaldi, a former Picasso Studio. There is a family in Münster in Germany, mainly prints. There are two in Spain, one is in Barcelona, and the other is in the birthplace of Picasso.(Costa del Sol)It belongs to Maraga, a Andalusia Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>There are more than 5,000 Picasso's works in Paris, and Maraa has only 233, and there are not many masterpieces. However, Maraa's Picasso Museum has been able to "make great achievements" in 20 years to promote Maraa's cultural development, promote Maraa's cultural tourism, and even in the evolution of the diversified socio -economic structure of the city. Play a pivotal role.</p>
<p>Different from Bilbao's shiny Pom -Dudu Art Museum building to attract sightseeing, Maraga has always been a resort for Europeans to chase the sun. But since the opening of the Picasso Museum, many people have not been far away. These people are not only for sunshine beaches, but also for art and culture. All of them are attributed to the "Maraa's most famous son" Picasso!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-58-13-00-00/000183521_piclink.jpg" /><strong> Maraa's most famous son </strong></p>
<p>Picasso was born on October 25, 1881 at No. 15, Mystedid Square, Malaga. His father, Jose Royce Brasco(Jose Ruiz Blasco)The curator of the art teacher and the municipal art gallery, the mother Maria Picasso Lopez(MARIA PICASOLEZ)It comes from the grape -made family. Picasso was baptized in the Church of San Diego, and the church now showed his baptism certificate. Picasso is the eldest son, and there are two younger sisters under him, but one of them died at the age of 3. When Picasso was 3 years old, the whole family moved to live with her grandmother and two aunts. So he has been surrounded by women since he was a child, and was loved by his aunt and grandmother.</p>
<p>Picasso once said that he would paint before he learned to speak. Although this statement is a bit exaggerated, it is encouraged by his father. Picasso has officially studied painting since the age of 7. The oil painting "Maraka" completed at the age of 8 has signed "PRUIZ". At the beginning, Picasso's signatures used his father's surname "Royce", and it was not until the age of 20 that he changed his signature to his mother's surname "Picasso".</p>
<p>Due to his father's work, Picasso moved to Columbia in the northwest corner of Spain at the age of 10(Lacoruña)At the age of 14, move to Barcelona again. Although Barcelona was 1,000 kilometers from Maraa, Picasso still returned to Maraga for three summer vacations. He last arrived in Maraga on January 28, 1901, and he never stepped into his hometown afterwards. In his 91 -year -old life, Maraga only took a short period of time, but his impact on him was a lifetime. When he was a kid, he often went to Maraga with his father Maraga(LaMalagueta)Watching bullfighting in the bullfighting field, this experience not only cultivates his enthusiasm for bullfighting, bulls and bulls also repeatedly appear in his works, including his masterpiece "Gelneyca", which condemn the violence of war,(Guernica)Essence Malaga's childhood left an indelible mark on Picasso, allowing him to retain the unique personality and spirit of Andalusia for a lifetime.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-58-13-00-00/000183542_piclink.jpg" /><strong> Maraa </strong></p>
<p>Maraga became the colonies of the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC, and is known for its reputation of "Pearl of the Mediterranean." In the next hundreds of years, Malaga has gone through the rule of Phoenicians, Romans, Germans and Byzantine. In 743 AD, the Arabs formally ruled Malaga and continued to rule for more than 700 years. Arabic rule has a profound impact on local music, art and architecture. Madéjar -style buildings are seen everywhere, and Flamenco music and dance are full of deep Arabic style.</p>
<p>In 1487, Malaga was conquered by the monarchs of Catholicism, Fedannan and Isabella, and became a Christian city. Due to geographical advantages, Malaga has always been an important trading center, and it is also very famous in fish processing and other industries. Since the 19th century, the rapid development of industry and agriculture has made Malaga one of Spain's economic town. In addition to the prosperous economy, Maraa's pleasant climate and beautiful beach have also attracted many holiday tourists who chase the sun.</p>
<p><strong> The birth of the museum </strong></p>
<p>When Picasso was still alive, someone proposed to build a art museum for him in Maraa, but the proposal had not been executed before Picasso's death. Picasso's eldest son Paul's widow Christie(Christine RuizPicasso)I did not forget the idea of Maraa's construction of art museums. While borrowing collection in the Picasso exhibition held in 1992 and 1994, it again suggested to the Malaga Municipal Authority to recommend the Picasso Museum. At that time, the Secretary of Culture of Andalucia Calwa(Carmen Calvo)She helped a lot of lobbying. In order to build a museum, in 1997, she acquired the municipal museum in the city center of Maraa and Picasso who had just served as the curator.(The Buenavista Palace)And about 15 buildings of different sizes near the palace. American architect Grookman(Richard Gluckman)Invited to renovate and design expansion for the museum. Christie and her son Bernard(Bernard Ruiz Picasso)Specially set up a museum management agency "Maraa Picasso Museum Foundation", and donated 233 works to the Foundation to invite Picasso scholar Jamenes(Carmen Giménez)As the curator.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-58-13-00-00/000183523_piclink.jpg" /><strong> Growth of the Museum </strong> **</p>
<p>The current curator Lebrello(José Lebrero)He took office in 2009. He pointed out that since he took office, although Malaga's population has not changed much, the number of tourists has increased significantly, making Malaga gradually transforming from a pure vacation city to a destination for vacation and cultural tourism. Taking last year's data as an example, the number of tourists in Maraa increased from 740,000 in 2009 to about 1.3 million, while the Sun Coast increased from 8.4 million to 17 million. This shows the vigorous development of Maraga and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The Picasso Museum is undoubtedly an important tourist attraction. Since the opening, nearly 9 million people have visited the museum. Last year alone, 641,216 people visited the Picasso Museum, surpassing the total number of visitors to other well -known art institutions in Maraa. Digital shows the popularity of the Picasso Museum in local residents and tourists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-58-13-00-00/000183526_piclink.png" />When the Picasso Museum was just open, because the public funds from the local government of Andalusia and did not have much administrative or economic exchanges with the Maraa Municipal Government, the number of visitors to the museum was increasing. The municipal government will be aware of the potential and importance of the cultural industry, and is committed to improving the promotion of the local cultural economy, and also increases the attractiveness of Maraa as a tourist destination.</p>
<p>The Picasso Museum is a private foundation with public control. Because it is a private foundation, the museum has a certain degree of flexibility and can carry out exhibitions, educational and cultural activities and publishing plans according to needs. However, as far as budget is concerned, museums are facing considerable challenges. Lebrelo pointed out that the 2009 annual budget was about 8.8 million euros, of which 79%came from the regional government and 21%came from museum revenue. The 2022 budget is 10 million euros, but only 42%come from the government, and the remaining 58%must rely on themselves. At the same time, the museum must also face the challenge of surge in the number of visitors.</p>
<p>Labralo is very fortunate that the museum has such a good signboard as Picasso. "We are the winners because we have the best horse racing." Picasso has the attraction of superstar, and people naturally have romantic emotions and obsession with his birthplace. The most important thing is the content. In the past 20 years, the museum regularly updates the collection exhibition by combining the works borrowed by FABA, and carefully planned special exhibitions. The museum focuses on contemporary cultural debates, questioned the inherent concept, and reinterpreted Picasso's works from a contemporary perspective. This not only enables the museum to keep pace with the times, but also allows the audience to appreciate and interpret Picasso's art from a new perspective. At the same time, the museum provides education, workshops, and cooperation with international art through exhibitions, seminars, and research methods. In addition, the digital and innovation of the museum not only expands the group of audiences, but also makes it easier for young people to contact and understand Picasso's art, while popularizing and spreading.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-08T22-58-13-00-00/000183524_piclink.jpg" />Picasso's charm and hometown feelings, coupled with the efforts of the museum itself, enables the museum to surpass the image of the simple "hometown museum". Is it a good example of the small soldier?</p>

<p>Investors' attitudes towards packaging food companies were suddenly cold. One of the main concerns is that the assistance obtained by these stocks from the price increase may soon fade. The factors that drive this wave of price increase are first to increase demand during the epidemic situation, and the second is to respond to the input cost inflation.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-09T02-22-44-08-00/08dc-spybase-kmfq-master1050.jpg" />According to three informed U.S. officials, China is planning to establish a facility in Cuba. U.S. officials are worried that the facility can perform spy activities on the United States by intercepting the electronic signals of nearby US military and commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Beijing has established monitoring posts elsewhere and has military existence in Cuba, but an eavesdropping station allows China to get a foothold about 160 kilometers from Florida coastline. It may monitor the United States from there.</p>
<p>Officials said that the planned facilities are close to the United States, which is particularly worrying because it may enhance the sensitive operations of Beijing monitoring in the southeast of the southeast, including the technical capabilities of several military bases.</p>
<p>"It is reported that Havana and Beijing are working with the people of the United States and our people. We are deeply disturbed," "Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Waner and Florida Republican Senator Malcow Lubero from the Senate Intelligence Committee It was said in a joint statement on Thursday. "The United States must respond to China's continuous and shameless attacks on our national security."</p>
<p>As the details of the negotiations between China and Cuba (American officials insist on anonymous discussion on this sensitive information), the Bayeng government is trying to stabilize the relationship with Beijing's main strategic opponent after intensifying tensions. "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuba-to-host-secret-chinese-spy-base-focusing-on-u-s-b2fed0e0">Wall Street Journal</a>"First reported the plan to establish facilities in Cuba.</p>
<p>President Biden's National Security Council refuted reports on the facility plan. "The report was not accurate," the committee spokesman John Kobe said in the statement, but he refused to disclose more details. "We really worry about the relationship between China and Cuba. From the first day of the government, we have always worried that China in our hemisphere and around the world."</p>
<p>Cerbin said that the government is paying close attention to these activities and taking measures to respond. He added, "We still believe that we have the ability to fulfill all our security commitments in China and the region."</p>
<p>Last year, after the former US Speaker Pelosi visited Taiwan, several diplomatic, military and climate cooperation between the two countries were frozen. Earlier this year, a Chinese spy balloon was found around the United States sensitive military location, and bilateral relations were further frustrated.</p>
<p>The balloon incident caused a strong rebound in Congress and prompted Secretary of State Brillin to cancel the trip originally scheduled to visit Beijing in February. According to U.S. officials, after several weeks of intense diplomatic activities, including the meeting between the national security adviser Sha Liwen and the senior Chinese official Wang Yi, Brinken plans to visit China soon. It is unclear whether the latest news about the establishment of facilities in Cuba will affect his visit again.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Central Intelligence Bureau and the Office of the National Intelligence Director refused to comment.</p>

<p>Cuban Foreign Ministry official Carlos Fernandez Dikko said that reports on the establishment of a spy base in Cuba are "completely wrong and unfounded." A representative of the Chinese Embassy said that Beijing "does not know this situation."</p>
<p>China and the United States often carry out monitoring operations.

<p>In recent years, U.S. officials have accused China of its ambitious [hacker attack] for the US government and enterprises.(https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html), Try to in the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/world/asia/china-linkedin-spies.html">recruiting agents</a>And intelligence assets, surveillance and <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221116/china-iran-private-detectives/">Chinese dissidents who threatened overseas</a>Essence</p>
<p>Analysts said that Beijing seems to be seeking closer arrangements with Cuba, which is not surprising. Since the end of the Cold War, the two countries have established increasingly close relationships. China is the largest trading partner in Cuba and plays an important role in the areas of this island country's agriculture, medicine, telecommunications, and infrastructure. Beijing also has a large part of Havana's foreign debt.</p>
<p>Cuba is close to the United States. It has long been an ideal strategy of American opponents for a long time. Perhaps the most famous is during the Cuban missile crisis, when the Soviet Union formulated a plan to deploy nuclear missiles in this island country, but later gave up. Today, the relationship between the United States and Cuba is largely hostile. Cuba, like China, is controlled by the Communist Party government.</p>
<p>Shortly after the communist regime led by Castro in 1959, the diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba fell into an deadlock; the relationship between the two countries was only during the term of President Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/americas/us-cuba-relations.html">fully recovered</a>Essence President Trump restored the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/travel/cuba-travel-restrictions-trump.html">certain travel ban</a>, And re -identify the country as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/politics/cuba-terrorism-trump-pompeo.html">country that supports terrorism</a>, Thus partial reversal the Obama administration's measures.</p>

<p><strong> The number of universities in first -tier cities has gradually declined </strong></p>
<p>The number of people in other cities in China has increased, while Beijing and Shanghai remain low, and even candidates have decreased significantly. Cai Shenkun, a financial commentator, told this station that this may be related to the decline in the concept and population of Shanghai residents: "Objective analysis, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand Some people have gone abroad, and more are fewer and fewer first -tier cities, especially young people, so the number of people in the college entrance examination is seriously affected.

In recent years, various industries in China are quickly losing the international market, and the demand for college students in China is getting lower and lower. He said that in China, "there is no college entrance examination without the market, so what else is needed to go to the college entrance examination.

<p>"Former President or Prime Minister's sue is always a major event, but in most democratic countries, it is normal for them to accuse them of serious crimes," He said that he wrote an article on the democratic transition of dozens of countries. He said that the United States is an exception and it is unwilling to accuse its former leaders.</p>
<p>"The political system must be dealt with," he also said. "They must do this. Because another choice is worse, it means that some people can override the law."</p>

<p>Public prosecution can reflect the strongness of the rule of law. Even powerful people cannot override the court and can be held accountable. However, these prosecution may also indicate that the rule of law is weak, that is, the legal system is easily regarded as a weapon against political opponents.</p>
<p>"Many people will immediately assume that this is for political reasons, and it is very difficult to persuade them to convince them. Even if it is not impossible, it is very difficult." John B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B.

<p>This is different from not recommended to prosecute.</p>

<p>"If you think there is a crime in law and you must advance, you will do it," Takki said. "But there are always two levels of justice and politics. People should try to separate them, but that is impossible."</p>
<p>Historically, authoritarian leaders have always suppressed their opponents, and even superficial procedural justice does not need to worry too much. But in recent years, dozens of such governments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/world/middleeast/egypt-accuses-morsi-of-vast-terrorist-plot.html">Turning in the court</a>, Use a pre -determined judgment to publicly condemn the opponent who was kicked off, and threatened others.</p>

For many years, Trump has described himself as a victim who was out of control and political persecution to unite his supporters. Joshritie for the New York Times</p>
<p>Prosecutors' work is the most tricky in democratic countries, because in these countries, public opinion is more important, and at least some expectations for fair judicial justice. The fair application of the law may be depicted as a political retaliation, and vice versa, which has increased pressure on the prosecutor's decision whether to carry out a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Berluskini, who has served as the Prime Minister for three times, has been prosecuted many times. He was convicted of tax fraud. Other crime judgments were overturned through the appeal, and some allegations were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/19/world/parliament-in-italy-passes-immunity-law-for-berlusconi.html">by modifying the law</a>Escape.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, like Neitanahu and Trump, he spent several years to portray himself as a victim who was out of control and political persecution. The scandal survived one by one.</p>
<p>Tak said that the combination of these situations will seriously damage the public's confidence in the judicial system -the defendant's supporters believe that the judicial system is unknown, and the opponent of the leader believes it does not work.</p>

<p>"If the judgment is not guilty, it can prove that the judicial system plays a role," she said. "But people claim that all this is out of nothing, for political purposes."</p>
<p>However, she also said, "Considering the case of Berluskini, I still say that this is correct. Even if there is no change, even if this extends his political life."</p>
<p>Legal experts point out a large number of moral gray areas. The allegations may be surrounded by real crimes, but they can still have political motivations or are doubtful.</p>

Facing the charges of corruption and serving for 19 months, he came back politically. Sarah Silbiger for thenew York Times</p>
<p>Another unclear field involves a widely used and non -punished form of corruption.</p>

<p>He also said that Hillary was not subject to the "weapon of the legal system", but was planted in the transformation of the routine. Hillary was convicted after he stepped down as the president of France because he established a false official position for political allies when he served as the mayor of Paris decades ago.</p>
<p>"Hillary did some things that were commonplace at the time," Voyce said.</p>
<p>Belins said that in order to ensure fair -or superficial fairness -like prosecutors and judges, they should "not be affected by political pressure." He also said that they should "try to" go to politics as much as possible.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that when officials were constantly accused of prejudice, and when they were appointed by the elected public officials or themselves, they were difficult to make the public believe in their fairness.</p>
<p>But he and other experts said that even if they faced such a difficult challenge, the judicial system should dare to promote reasonable cases against political leaders.</p>
<p>"When people are arrested, they always launch a wanton attack on judicial procedures, which is common," Levitzki said. "But if you snatched a bank, I arrested you, you threatened to throw grenades at the court, then it was not in that I would arrest you because you robbed the bank."</p>

<p>At the recently -ended Shangri -La dialogue, the Minister of Defense of China and the United States was shaking hands behind the shaking hands and accusing each other, so that the outside world was worried about the status quo of the relationship between the two countries. This shows that the recent relationship between China and the United States is described as "Spring Blossoms", which may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>"Spring Warm" means that compared with the "balloon incident" in March, high -level contacts and dialogue stops in the two countries have recently restored high -level dialogue. Wang Yi, director of the China Foreign Affairs Office, and US National Security Consultant, Sarawon, talked about eight hours in Vienna for two days. When the Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao participated in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC) Minister of Economic and Trade, he held talks with US Secretary of Commerce Raymondo and trade representative Dai Qi. Xie Feng, the ambassador to the United States in the near future, has been in Washington to take office, and meet with the Deputy Secretary of State of the State Council and the Deputy Minister of Finance. In May, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) secretly visited China in May. The latest news is that the Secretary of State Kangda, the assistant Secretary of State of East Asian affairs in the US State Department, and the Director of the China Center of the White House National Security Council, Bilan, visiting China.</p>
<p>"Flower is not open" means that high -level contact between China and the United States is still limited to the economic and trade field. Previously, the U.S. Climate Special Envoy, Minister of Commerce, Minister of Finance, and Secretary of State have successively stated that they have to visit China and have not yet seen shadows. China also explicitly rejected the two countries' defense ministers officially talks at the Shangri -La dialogue. If these ministers of the United States cannot come to China in the second half of the year, especially the Secretary of State cannot visit China, it indicates that the seriousness of the "balloon incident" impact on the relationship between the two countries has not disappeared.</p>
<p>However, in any case, because the APEC leadership meeting was held in the United States this year, Xi Jinping and Biden had another face -to -face talk. Because Chinese leaders cannot be absent from such major occasions, if they come to the conference to meet with Biden, they will not be over, which means that the relationship between the two countries is close to completely shattered. This level.</p>
<p>Although the senior management of the two countries restored some dialogue, it seemed more of the United States initiated, and China was in a calm observation state. There may be three reasons why Washington has to break the diplomatic deadlock between the two sides since March. First, it was found that some of the "climatic events" did a lot of topics and over -hype, which exaggerated the harm of China's "spy balloon" to the United States. Washington has not announced the results of the "spy balloon" survey, and what evidence that threatens US land security. Second, there are many recent troubles in the United States. The most urgent debt limit negotiations. Although the two parties reached an agreement, they can solve this problem and also need to be helped by other countries including China. In addition, the situation of the Taiwan Strait is becoming more and more severe. Both parties need to set up guardrails and global issues such as climate. Third, the senior Washington officials shouted to visit China, which did not rule out the creation of a effect in public opinion. The responsibility of the Sino -US interrupt exchange dialogue was blamed China: Washington wants to talk to Beijing, but the latter is unwilling to let the Beijing side be afforded by the international side. Public pressure.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Beijing, the U.S.'s "spy balloon" treatment makes Beijing feel too bullying, reflecting the "hysteria" of the United States and society in China. Beijing believes that he is the victim of the "spy balloon" incident. When Beijing feels that on its own side, it will usually cancel high -level interaction and related exchanges and cooperation between the two parties for countermeasures. Generally speaking, the relatively strong side, more hopes to see the transparency and predictability of the opponent's behavior; and the relatively weak party, likes to be blurred, does not want the other party to see their behavior intention. Therefore, Beijing's cancellation of high -level exchanges between the two parties is not beneficial to Washington. However, Beijing does not really want to deal with Washington in the future. The cancellation of high -level interaction is just an expression of a posture. As long as Washington issues a signal of recovery exchange, Beijing will respond half a half to the place to relieve the restrictions on high -level exchanges between the two parties. This situation has repeatedly occurred in the past.</p>
<p>However, this time in Beijing and the past, in the face of the appeal of senior US officials, they repeatedly stated that the United States must come up with sincerity. It is not possible to suppress China while saying that they can exchang and cooperate. This is not possible. Perhaps Beijing has been realized that Washington's exchange signal is not sincere after experiencing such a situation. Nevertheless, Beijing is also worried that if the appeal of Washington has been ignored, it is indeed possible to be rejected by American public opinion to push the responsibility to the two countries to the Chinese head. Beijing does not want to give the international community this impression. This is a background factor that has been recovered recently in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p>However, from the talks between Wang Wentao and Raymond and Daiqi, this heating is very fragile, and it may be interrupted by an accident or a certain US policy at any time. According to the Chinese report, the talks between Wang Wentao and the two involved different issues, and China used frank, professional and constructive exchanges to express the former; Each words, emphasizing their respective positions, the only consensus is that the two sides agreed to continue communication.</p>
<p>In other words, the only result of the two talks between Sino -US economic and trade high -level economic and trade is that the competent officials of the two parties met and agreed to continue to meet next time. Many people will say that from the status quo of Sino -US relations, meeting is better than not to meet. Even if you meet, you can let the other party understand what his bottom line and demand are, thereby avoiding misjudgment. Indeed, meeting also has a role, but that's it. If the two parties have no consensus in economic and trade fields with a large intersection and relatively compromised economic and trade fields, they will not have any consensus, then it is even more impossible to obtain any consensus in the field of diplomacy and national defense in their respective strategic security. Therefore, this time, the Sino -US defense ministers have been tit -for -tat and not allowed in Taiwan, South China Sea, Sino -US relations and global security issues.</p>
<p>This can not help but suspect the outside world. Is there any need for such talks for this, and why can't China and the United States jump out of their respective interests and deal with bilateral relations from the perspective of a wider human interest? The key is the lack of trust. This is the crux of all the problems of all China and the United States. Without the most basic trust, the two sides can only go all out to confront. Wu Xinbo, a professor at Fudan University, who is familiar with Xie Feng, recently interviewed the Chinese media that Sino -US relations are currently facing two main problems: First, the United States has incorrect cognition of China and regards China as the most important strategic competitors. It is believed that China wants to challenge the existing international order; the second is that the United States has taken competition as the most important part of Sino -US relations in the design of China, and the competition is actually curbing and suppressing China. The reason why the United States has such "incorrect" cognition and policies for China is caused by the lack of mutual trust. Therefore, China wants the United States to re -correct the awareness of China and change its competitive policy for China. It is not possible in the next few years.Nevertheless, from this perspective, the talks between the two sides are still meaningful. In many talks, the two parties establish the lowest degree of consensus on a certain issue and something, and then slowly slowly slowly, and then slowly slowly slowly. Accumulate more consensus. This will certainly be a very slow and torment process. At present, it is far from time to time, so there must be strategic patience. As far as the historical trend of China and the United States is concerned, the two sides have not yet separated from the cold winter; but as far as Bayeng has been on power, the two parties may enter the early spring and feel the warmth of some kind of early spring, but now this kind of warmth is not enough to achieve it to reach The degree of the extent of the flower bud also requires both parties and the outside world to work harder.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice has been investigating Trump after leaving the White House in 2021, whether it is not handled by the documents he holds. Last year, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美司法部公开宣誓书-曝光突击搜查特朗普理由/a-62949859">Prosecutors seized about 13,000 documents in Haihu Manor, Palm Beach, Florida</a>About 100 of which are confidential files.</p>

<p>Description: In 2016, Trump grabbed Hillary's "Mail Door" masterpiece. Now he is also caught in the "File Gate". This problem helps him to enter the White House may now destroy the opportunity to return to the White House and return to the origin. Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times confidential document case was prosecution, which was the second prosecution faced by former President Trump, but in many aspects, this case far exceeded the first pile in terms of legal seriousness and political risks.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-09T05-06-52-08-00/08dc-trump-assess-zgmh-master1050-v3.jpg" />For a while, in fact, not long ago, Trump said he attached importance to protecting confidential information. Of course, his opponent was accused of having the security of confidential information, which was a useful political weapon for Trump.</p>
<p>Throughout 2016, he was condemning Hillary Clinton to use a private email server instead of a safe government server. "I will execute all laws on protecting confidential information," he claims. "No one can override the law." He said that Hillary's carelessness of sensitive information means "she is not qualified to be president."</p>
<p>Seven years later, due to the confidential documents when leaving the White House and refusing to return all documents after being summoned, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/08/us/trump-indictment-documents/justice-department-charges-trump-in-documents-case?smid=url-share">facing criminal allegations that endangers national security</a>Essence The problem of helping Trump into the White House at first may now destroy the opportunity to return to the White House. Even in the many cases of "beyond the anti -Direct" in the United States politics, this matter is not the same.</p>
<p>Federal Jury on Thursday should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel-trump-indictment.html">Special Prosecutor Jack Smith</a>The indictment issued by the request actually returned Trump's story to the origin. "Hold her up," the crowd at his campaign rally shouted under his encouragement. Now, if any of the seven of the allegations is convicted, including conspiracy to hinder judicial fairness and intentional retaining documents, it may be him.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>This indictment is the second public prosecution of the former president in recent months, but in many aspects, it has surpassed the first pile in terms of legal severity and political risks. The first prosecution <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/nyregion/trump-indictment-hush-money-charges.html">announced by the prosecutor of Manhattan area in March</a>, Accusing Trump forge a business record to cover up a sealing fee to a porn actress who claims to have sex with him. The second indictment was mentioned by the federal prosecutor representing the country. This is the first criminal case in the history of American history and involves national secrets.</p>
<p>The person who defended Trump tried to treat the first prosecutor as a local election of the Democrats. Even if he was accused of doing very unsatisfactory things, it seemed that he was harmless after all, and it happened before he took office, but the latest allegations were the latest allegations. Directly originated from his responsibility as the primary protection information of the country, and these materials may be useful for the enemy in the United States.</p>
<p>Republican voters may not care if their leaders have stuffed money to let porn stars shut down, but will they be indifferent to preventing the authorities from recovering secret materials?</p>
<p>Maybe. Trump certainly hopes to do so. The prosecution in Manhattan not only did not hurt him, but increased his public opinion support. Therefore, he immediately called the new public prosecution as part of the conspiracy of the largest cost of the week in American history. According to his statement, this was a local and federal prosecutor, a member of the jury, a judge, plaintiff, supervisor and witnesses participating in Widely conspired, they have been lying for many years to frame him, and he is the only person who tells the truth, no matter what the allegations are.</p>
<p>"I never thought that such a thing would happen to a former US president. The votes he received were much more votes than any of the president in our history, and at the current public opinion survey of the Presidential Election in 2024 People, including the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, "he wrote on his social media website, and finally made multiple misleading assertions in one sentence:" I am a innocent person!"</p>
<p>So far, his core supporters have always supported him, and even some people who opposed him to be nominated by the Republican Party next year have also criticized investigations against him. However, he has recently been sentenced to sexual assault in civil trials. His company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/nyregion/trump-org-verdict-guilty.html">17 offenders have 17 tax fraud and other crimes</a>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/politics/trump-criminal-investigations.html">also faces two other possible public prosecution</a>It originated from his attempt to overthrow the results of the defeat in 2020 and led to the attack on the parliamentary building on January 6, 2021.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>At least on the political level, the question is whether these accumulated accumulation can eventually affect his image among Republican voters fans, especially if the third item is come again, there may be the fourth prosecution. At least, some people nominated by his party are expected to drag the support of his voters.</p>
<p>As for Clinton, whether it was a bit gloating on Thursday night, the defeated candidate did not speak. However, she and her allies have always believed that James B. Kemi, then the director of the Federal Investigation Bureau, restarted an email survey a few days ago in the 2016 election and caused her defeat, although countless polls predicted that she would win.</p>
<p>Trump will work hard to turn the spearhead and point to the person who is investigating, claiming that he has been persecuted because Clinton did the same thing, but he was not prosecuted.</p>
<p>He doesn't care about the facts of the two cases. He has intended to obstruct the authorities who tried to retrieve confidential documents for a few months, and investigators in the Clinton case concluded that Clinton did not intentionally violate the law. But for Trump, the victims who insist on being a dual standard are politically helping him.</p>
<p>As for the context of campaign in 2016, why he still did not realize that the improper processing of confidential information would cause trouble, and it should be more careful, which is another problem. He ignored information security concerns for most of his presidents, nor did he care about preserving the rules of government documents.advertise</p>
<p>Even if the hostage asked the consequences of this, he never showed concerns. After all, he is the president of the dignitarian, and he does whatever he wants. During the investigation of the confidential documents that he brought him to Mara, he was still arguing, claiming that he had the right to decrypt the documents he chose, and he only needed him to have this idea.</p>
<p>But he is no longer president. The preliminary voters will decide whether he has lost his qualification to run for president, but in addition to voters, he still needs to face a prosecutor, and this person has stated that he will implement laws of confidential information.</p>
<p>He will be registered as a criminal prosecution. If he is not surprised, he will eventually face the judgment of the jury.</p>
<p>Seven years can bring such a big contrast.</p>

<p>The United States is the organizer of the APEC Leadership Conference in November this year, and Hong Kong is also a member of APEC. However, Li Jiachao, the top official of Hong Kong and the current Chief Executive of Hong Kong, was sanctioned by the United States in 2020. At that time, he served as the Security Director.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-09T06-02-07-00-00/000000.png" />The study was published in the journal "Lancet Infectious Diseases".</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reports that this discovery is hailed as a "milestone" that may fight the long -term COVID sequelae. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that every 10 people infected with COVID-19 have one person with long-term sequelae, and the public has little to know about this phenomenon so far.</p>
<p>Studies have pointed out that this is the third stage test of random and comparison with placebo, showing that taking drugs can prevent long -term COVID sequelae.</p>
<p>This study tested a drug called "MetFormin"; this medicine was originally developed from French clove flower. For decades, it has been the most commonly used drug in the world for treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>This study covers 1,126 overweight or obese people in the United States, half of them took the two-meta duality within a few days after detecting the COVID-19 positive reaction, and the other half took a placebo.</p>
<p>Ten months later, 35 of the subjects who took the two -metal dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -dual -cymbal time were diagnosed with long -term COVID sequelae, and 58 people were taking placebo groups; this meant that the risk of the sequelae of the two -section of the dual -dual -dual -dualty was reduced by 40%.</p>
<p>This test was performed between December 2020 and January 2022, which means that the Omitron variable strains were included. Studies have shown that this mutant strain leads to the lower probability of long -term COVID sequelae lower than the previous virus strains.</p>
<p>The team that performs the test once said that the risk of Erjia double-dual-dual-dual-to-19 patients can reduce the risk of emergency, hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients by more than 40%.</p>
<p>The main author of this new study, the University of Minnesota, Researcher Carolynbramante, said: "Our data shows that the number of new coronary virus (SARS-COV-2) of the dual-dual-duplex (patients in the patient's body) said ","</p>
<p>At present, it is estimated that tens of millions of people have suffered from long -term COVID sequelae. Many of the sometimes weak symptoms continue, or recur after 3 months, and may be dragged for several years.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms of long -term COVID sequelae include fatigue, difficulty breathing, and unclear thinking called "brain mist". (Translator: Ji Jinling)</p>

<p>Since the Ukraine War, Ukraine has acknowledged that Ukraine could not join the new international alliance before the end of the war. But from last year, from the perspective of far away to now, the United States' attitude towards Ukraine's joining NATO has changed rapidly. Ukraine's joining NATO seems to be a difference: everything has everything, only the east wind is owed (the end of the war). What if the Ukrainian counterattack failed? Is it expected whether NATO will absorb Ukraine and deal with Putin together. Although this sounds incredible, NATO's bottom line of Ukraine has retreated again and again, flexible as if there is no bottom line.</p>
<p>From July 11th to 12th, NATO will hold a peak meeting in Vernis, the capital of Lithuania. Ukraine will join NATO's routes in the key content. The most hesitant country today is the United States and Germany. In addition to Britain, the most resolute one is the Nine Kingdoms of the Balterst (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, all of which belong to the former Soviet Union). These countries issued a joint statement saying: "We expect to raise the political relationship with Ukraine to a new level in Vilnius, and start a new political track. Once the conditions are allowed, Ukraine will be assisted in the NATO organization."</p>
<p>The term "NATO East Expansion" in the Chinese media is called Enlargement ofnato in English, which is expanded by NATO. If NATO is fine and does not expand, it shows that the world is peaceful. Before Putin invaded Ukraine, NATO was that state. In 2019, French President Macron even said that NATO was "brain death" because he had a military alliance without an enemy and was idle. Last year, Russian President Putin moved, and NATO found the biggest survival motivation. In the past year, members of the member states have frequently met. Although NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg cannot be compared with Ukrainian President Zesky, it is also important in the media in the media figure.</p>
<p>NATO was founded on April 4, 1949 by 12 countries in Europe and North America. It is currently a military collective defense system composed of 31 countries. Article 10 of the North Atlantic Convention stipulates how countries each country joins the alliance. The convention pointed out: "European countries that have the ability to promote the treaty and contribute to the security of the North Atlantic region can be added." 19 countries have expanded the NATO through the nine rounds (1952, 1955, 1982 in 1982 , 1999, 2004, 2009, 2017, 2020, 2023). The first batch of new members was Greece and Türkiye in 1952. In May 1955, Federal Germany joined NATO to promote the Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Treaty Organization). After the Franco regime ended, democratic Spain chose to join NATO in 1982. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, many former Huayo and the post -Soviet countries sought to join NATO. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic became members of NATO in 1999. In 2004, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia joined NATO. Albania and Croat joined in 2009, followed by Montenegro in 2017 and North Malaysia in 2020. Two months ago, Finland officially joined NATO. Sweden joined NATO was originally blocked by Turkey. Now it has won the United States and the process accelerates. Finland and Sweden joined NATO are urgent self -protection behaviors that were frightened by Putin, and Ukraine, which everyone's concern, joined NATO, is a long long journey for many years.</p>
<p>After Ukraine announced his territory in Russia, he applied to join NATO in September 2022. However, the relationship between Ukraine and NATO began in 1991. At that time, the newly independent Ukraine joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. In the past 32 years, different Ukrainian government has different attitudes towards NATO, and sometimes tends to Russia, sometimes falling to NATO and the European Union, and lacks continuity. At the same time, the attitude of the US government has changed much; and NATO is worried that the absorption of Ukraine will anger Putin, and this worry has always existed.</p>
<p>In addition to Zeelianzki, Youxianke is another President Ukrainian President (third, 2005-2010 in 2005-2010). He was poisoned in 2004 (it is said to be a poison under Russia). The world is concerned. He is an active supporter of Ukraine to join NATO.</p>
<p>During the period when Ukraine's most close Putin, the term of office of the fourth President Yanukovic (2010-2014). At that time, he violated the campaign commitment, refused to sign the European Union to contact the State Agreement and Free Trade Agreement. The Eurasian economic community eventually triggered the square uprising in February 2014 (EUROMAIDANUPRISING), Yanukovic escaped, and Russia swallowed Crimea in chaos.</p>
<p>On December 23, 2014, the Ukrainian parliament abandoned Ukraine's unreasonable status, and this step was severely condemned by Russia. On September 20, 2018, the Ukrainian parliament approved the amendment to the Constitution, and will join NATO and the European Union as its core goals and major foreign policy goals.</p>
<p>In 2019, Zelei became president and continued to join NATO's efforts. On September 14, 2020, Zeroski approved Ukraine's new national security strategy, which stipulates that it has a unique partnership with NATO in order to join NATO. At the end of November 2020, NATO confirmed that Ukraine was a candidate for NATO members. On April 7, 2021, the Russian army began to gather near the Ukraine border.</p>
<p>At the Brussels Summit in June 2021, Secretary -General Stoltenberg emphasized that Russia will not be able to reject Ukraine to join NATO because we will not return to the era when the sphere of influence and the great country determine what the small country should do.</p>
<p>On November 28, 2021, Ukraine warned that Russia gathered nearly 92,000 troops near its border and speculated that Putin intends to launch an offense at the end of January or early February. Russia has accused Ukraine for its own military assembly and demanded that "Ukraine will never join NATO" by law. On November 30, 2021, Putin said that NATO expanded the existence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long -range missiles that can crack down on Moscow will be a "red line" problem for the Kremlin.</p>
<p>On January 25, 2022, NATO "resolutely excluded the core requirements of Moscow's opposition to the further expansion of NATO." Russia requested NATO's "long -term open policy for new member states" and asked NATO to withdraw troops and equipment from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>On February 21, 2022 before Putin launched the invasion, Zerrenceki accused Putin accusing Putin for "destructing peace talks" and excluded the possibility of making any territory to make concessions. On the same day, Stoltenberg suggested that Russia chose diplomatic channels with the strongest wording and immediately reversed its large -scale military assembly in Ukraine and its surroundings.Peace was really temporary, and we couldn't escape the fate of the war. In the 21st century, Asia -Europe is similar to the replica of Europe in the 19th century. While saying that he does not want to fight, he is moving towards a terrible ahead. NATO continued to expand and even wanted to expand to East Asia. Before achieving European peace, there was a history of dark war in the European continent for more than a thousand years. No continent did not know that "how to find the light of peace on the flames of war."</p>

<p>The future belongs to Asia, a highly respected analyst Parag Conner(Paragkhanna)Thus thinks. But this judgment that has been generally accepted is necessary to explain. Geographically, Asia and Europe are not a continent. "Asia" itself is not even the concept of Asians: Europeans invented the word. Asians did not feel that they belonged to a separate mainland in the past. This area is too vast and diverse, so that it is impossible to have such an idea.</p>
<p>This is still the case. What is currently happening is actually a global re -balance, and the dominance of humans in Europe and its colonial descendants -this dominance has changed the world in a long history -gradually weakening. A multi -pole and chaotic world will replace it. Will "Asia" be a huge part of this world? certainly. China and India will play a role. But Asia is not so much a stage.</p>

Teacher Eu (pseudonym) taught in a middle school in Jiulong said to BBC Chinese. "The Education Bureau will be randomly learned, and you will be considered unprofessional to catch you wrong."</p>
<p>A large number of teachers were "ash" (reporting) during the "Removal Division" campaign in 2019, and "White Terror" continued to this day. She said that she is still very careful now, especially her teaching is regarded as "high -risk subjects" "citizens and society" Development Division (referred to as communes).</p>
<p>The discipline was formerly known as the "General Education Department". The course was open. It aims to cultivate students to care about social affairs and multi -angle thinking. In 2020, the government announced the reform course and became dominated by national conditions. At the same time, according to the "Hong Kong National Security Law" requirements, "national security education" was implemented in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Teacher Ou is currently taking into account the relevant coordination of the school. She said that before the Education Bureau went to the school last year, she summoned Chinese and historical teachers to review the collections of the library in the school and removed the seemingly sensitive books.</p>
<p>"We even took away the books that Professor Lu Dile talked about Hong Kong culture and were not politicized at all. He thought that everything was lost, but they (the Education Bureau) still found the so -called banned book, which was some English books about Chinese history. Of course, they did not explain to it. The reason, but everyone guess it was because of the "six four '" in it. "</p>

<p>After the "anti -repair" movement in Hong Kong in 2019, a large number of young people were arrested and imprisoned for related protests. BBC interviewed the "anti -repair" motion demonstrators from prison, as well as supporting networks for helping people into prison for social movement cases.</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Hong Kong Public Library took more than 200 sensitive books under the name of "Clean up illegal or National Security". Most of them were the works of democratic people, which caused social uproar. But in fact, this political review has long penetrated the campus of primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>"The British Literature Division of our school has used George Orwell's" Animal Farm "for many years. The teacher (pseudonym) said.</p>
<p>She was also arranged to be responsible for the national security education in the school after 2019. She said that colleagues were uneasy to face the fuzzy standards. "The bureau has never announced a list of banned books, nor does it stipulate what cannot be said. It will only give some course goals and guidelines. You can guess what you can't say."</p>
<p>She said that according to the hand -arranged by the school, teachers in other disciplines must also teach the science of junior high school. The authorities have threatened to significantly modify the relevant courses. "We have adopted the most conservative approach. This part of the teacher is not as good as this announcement, but my colleagues are still very nervous, and constantly ask me, can these things be taught?"</p>

<p>The "Hong Kong National Security Law" came into effect on June 30, 2020. Since then, the Hong Kong government will launch the "National National Security Day" event on April 15 each year.</p>
<p>According to the Hong Kong Police Department, from June 9, 2019 to December 31, 2022, the police arrested 10,279 people during the demonstration, of which 4010 were students. After the "National Security Law" came into effect on June 30, 2020, more than 250 people have been arrested by the law, and their age is 15 to 90 years old.</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua, a Hong Kong social policy and public administrative scholar who has moved to the United Kingdom, analyzed the BBC Chinese analysis that Hong Kong has entered the era of authoritarian, and authoritarian governance is based on power, not tangible provisions and laws.</p>
<p>"In fact, there is no standard. It depends on the governance team at the time. The National Security Law is the best example. Mainland China is a long -term use of this method. When some people cannot know the objective standards, they can only guess by themselves, and he also wants you to guess, and you naturally dare not touch the sensitive things. This is a typical authoritarian political characteristics. ""Excluding sensitive police rights, I taught Hong Kong's multiculturalism and race in the other section, quoting the Basic Law that everyone has equal rights, including religious freedom and freedom of speech. At this time Is there a freedom of speech in Hong Kong? Other students are anxious to stop. "</p>

<p>Hong Kong protests the four -year year: "Removal China" movement back and end to the end</p>
<p>Teacher Xu admits that students are affected by the major environment of the society, and the self -examination from the bottom up is very serious. "In 2019, we can also discuss the benefits and disadvantages of demonstrations in the classroom. It is very rational. After three years, even if I want to discuss students, I don’t want to participate. The academic atmosphere is very poor. Everyone will not express themselves freely. "</p>
<p>Chen Jialuo, a professor at the Department of Political and International Relations of the Hong Kong Baptist University, pointed out to BBC that officials have continued to suppress and arrest in the past three years to create ripple effects. "Everything is national security. The atmosphere of this infinite outline and no far -end hats has made the public make adjustments, and everything avoids everything."</p>
<p>He said that the people of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in history have also experienced this life model. After the "Prague Spring" failure in 1968, Czechoslovak Fall. (Normalization) plans to launch political cleaning and high -pressure governance, detain different segastes, and monitor the people with secret police.</p>
<p>The late Czech President Harvel (Václav HAVEL) described it as a "post-totalitarianism" at the time. Everyone had a red line in their hearts, rooted and internalized political authority. Essence Chen Jialuo said: "The same is true in Hong Kong today. There is no need to take the official shot at all.</p>

<p>This social atmosphere made the "Hong Kong Drifting" reporter Andy (Andy) feel that he had known each other. He said that the "Hong Kong Drifting" friends around him were all liberals and occasionally discussed the current politics, but everyone was alert. "Always talk about half of it, someone panickedly, whether the phone will be recorded, will it be reported, everyone has left China, but it is still in a state of fear. It used to be like this with mainlanders. Now The same is true for friends in Hong Kong. They will say, don't talk about it anymore, be careful of being caught by Guoan. "</p>
<p>Andy moved to Hong Kong in 2018 and joined the English media. In 2019, he interviewed the "Counterfeit Middle" movement at the front line and experienced the great changes in the press in recent years.</p>
<p>He said that at the beginning of the exercise, the police pulled up the "Orange Belt" blockade to prevent the reporters from shooting. "I arrived first, and I wanted to turn around when I saw the orange belt. Then a large group of Hong Kong reporters arrived. They saw that all the orange belts were scolded together and scolded the police to hinder the freedom of the press. . At that moment, I woke up. It turned out that I had a problem. I used to be detained and questioned in the mainland. I was very afraid of the police. The instinctual response was to run away. Dogs, but Hong Kong reporters know their rights very well. "</p>
<p>However, the police expanded during the "counter -delivery" movement. A few months later, he encountered similar incidents in an interview. By July 1, 2020, the "National Security Law" took effect the next day, a citizen went to the streets to protest. The reporter at the scene even saw the police's defense line actively avoided it. This change made him sigh. "I came to work in Hong Kong in freedom of news. How do I know that in just a few months, Hong Kong reporters have become the same as that of my mainland reporters. The whole environment has changed."</p>
<p>After 2019, the role of the media as the fourth power and the public supervision agency (Publicwatchdog) has weakened significantly. The charged, according to the annual press freedom index of no borders, the 73rd in 2019, the 73rd in 2019 to the 140th in 2023.</p>
<p>In addition to tangible suppression, there are also intangible transformations. Hong Kong Radio, Wired News, and NOW News successively have a large earthquake in personnel. Government officers and pro -Chinese people who have no broadcasting experience in airborne are high -rise, and they have made controversy in the handling of many news.</p>
<p>MAPLE (pseudonym), a senior reporter who worked on the TV station, described the current "standing is heavy, professional as the deputy", and the inferior coins expelled good coins. With the interview director and senior colleagues of the "veteran opening veterans", she also had a year ago. Saying. "Previous Taib (TVB) news was accused of very 'river crab" ("harmonious" homophonic), and also experienced this kind of personnel change, but that's the process of ten years. Now we are completed within two years. The emergency and huge, we have worked hard for many years, and the credibility of many years is gone. "</p>
<p>The professional level of the media has declined, and the objective effect is the increase in official discourse. MAPLE said that the news editor room has a relatively lighter journalist. They lack practical experience, and their superiors cannot provide help. "So you will see many sections of the follow -up officials. No reporters are questioned and questioned. Speaking of the law, this allows the official to monopolize the entire discussion.

<p>Authorities reforming the election system at all levels in Hong Kong have greatly reduced democratic composition and direct election seats, claiming to be a "improvement" system.</p>
<p>After 2019, the outbreak of immigration broke out in Hong Kong, which applied for a BNO visa -that is, the British national (overseas) visa -150,000 people who moved to the UK. A survey of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in April this year showed that 74%of the company faced the problem of talent shortage, and 70%of the employees resigned were due to immigration.</p>
<p>However, while the people voted with their feet, the official promoted the "National Security Law" to "chaos anyway" in Hong Kong. The new stage of Xing "". The SAR Government has also launched a series of activities such as "Hello Hong Kong" and "Happy Hong Kong" to actively "tell the story of Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Scholar, who has moved to Britain, said that these political slogans are like Owaer's "NewSpeak" in the political fable novel "1984". rule. "This is a textual wand used by the authoritarian government. The so -called" Patriot Governing Hong Kong ', and the "Patriot" is defined by him. Packing the front and beautiful words, thereby changing everyone's cognition. "</p>
<p>He said that this set of language techniques was very successful in mainland China. People have been immersed and polluted for a long time, and they will slowly be led by this set of logic. "This is why the" little pink "phenomenon appears. Hong Kong people have experienced the stage of civilization. In addition, there are still freedom of network freedom, and the resistance of resistance will be higher than that of the Chinese people. This is worth worrying about. "</p>
<p>He continued that the official was using language to control narratives to set the tone of political events. "If you set the tone, you can't discuss it again. The source of the 'counter -delivery' movement is that Hong Kong citizens are worried that the amendment to the" Fugm Regulations "violates the guarantee of the rule of law, but officials cannot use the dialectical process to persuade you, and use the language of the struggle to label you. 'Color Revolution', talk about the slogan of some conclusive, and put the nature of the whole thing into his frame, there is no need to debate. "</p>
<p>In August 2019, officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council of China publicly stated that the anti -repair example demonstration was the "color revolution", and then the official repeatedly referred to as "black storms" and "foreign forces". In April 2023, Xia Paolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office, also said that although the Hong Kong version of the "Color Revolution" was not successful, this is a scar that can never be wiped in Hong Kong history, as if hanging on his head on his head The alarm bells must always be alert to street violence, "soft confrontation" secretly chaos and overseas Hong Kong activities.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Hong Kong Government officials followed Xia Baolong's argument. In the recent organ donation disputes, the Chief Executive Li Jiachao emphasized that he should be alert to the risk of Guoan and be careful to prevent "soft confrontation". The Hong Kong police arrested four people who suspected of stealing other people's information and used them to try to cancel the registration of organ donation. The Hong Kong version of the color revolution is similar to provoking contradictions through various reasons to create destruction of inconsistent reality. "</p>
<p>Scholar Chen Jialuo said: "Any people's livelihood incident can be promoted to the level of 'Color Revolution'. If you have a little dissatisfaction, he will help you think about it, it is called 'soft confrontation'."</p>

<p>The SAR Government has launched plans such as "Hello Hong Kong" and "Happy Hong Kong"</p>
<p>For this new political context, civil servants must also re -adapt. Jing En (pseudonym) in the middle level in the Hong Kong government's trading department revealed to BBC that some used words have become sensitive. For example, the "independent customs zone" must be changed to "separate customs zone", and "refueling" cannot appear in government slogans and " Copywriting, so as not to make people think of the demonstration slogan "Hong Kong people".</p>
<p>She also said that in recent years, almost every document has been changed to its all -recognition. The upper -level officials will join the political terms and slogans of mainland China and put the Hong Kong policy under the framework of the national policy. "'Fourteenth Five -Year Plan', 'Guangdong -Hong Kong -Macao Greater Bay Area', 'Belt and Road", now all documents must be added to these words, politics is correct. Related projects can be very good. "</p>
<p>She also noticed that the domestic officials began to penetrate the civil servant system. "I opened the email that day, and our emails were written in English, but the attachments actually wrote what 'boss difficulties'. At first glance, it was not a word used by Hong Kong people. Everyone saw it."</p>
<h3>"Double -sided person" under normalizationImage source, getty images</h3>
<p>After the 2019 "Counterfeit Central" campaign, the authorities asked civil servants to swore to support the Basic Law and loyal to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and even deleted "political neutrality" in the Civil Servant Code. Civil servants were also required to complete more "political tasks". In December 2022, the former Chinese President Jiang Zemin died, and the Hong Kong government rarely asked all civil servants to watch the memorial service and silent for three minutes.</p>
<p>Jing En recalled that at that time, each department was empty, and all colleagues had to let go of their jobs and mourn. Unless they asked for leave that day to "spare". "Many more than there is KPI (key performance indicators) above. Each department must take pictures and upload it to Facebook pages to make work. There are more and more things that make everyone anti -white, but there is no way, you dare not dare to dare If you don't do it, everyone is helpless. "</p>
<p>Under the National Security Law, the education community also has more "facade kung fu" to do. The authorities stipulate that primary and secondary schools must hold a flag -raising ceremony every week and participate in the mainland inspection team. Teacher Ou, who taught the social science science, said: "Knowing that it is a political task, but I will take students to the Mainland to investigate, and I will also want them to learn things. After all, it is not a bad thing to know the national conditions. Foshan, it took 7 hours in 11 hours to spend transportation and eating, and there was no educational significance in the poor schedule, just to do it. "</p>
<p>Authorities also stipulate that each subject must have elements to maintain national security, and even surgery is no exception. "Our sports teacher thought for a long time before thinking about how to add some national security elements. For example, when explaining the ball, as the citizens need to abide by the law, players must follow the ball. In fact, it is very ridiculous."</p>
<p>Professor Chen Jialuo said that after 2019, Hong Kong's "secondary return", the new style in the new era and new normal is mimicking. "Everyone has to make great work, red, fighting left, and rotten. Of course, we are very embarrassed, but those who are power are very happy. This is part of the means of maintaining stability. Climbing must show loyalty. "</p>
<p>He quoted former Czech President Harville's "The Power of thePower" in his masterpiece "The Power of thePowerless". Get up!"Poster, this slogan is not his true thoughts, he just obeys the power to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong has also formed a different culture in the table, which is getting closer to mainland China. The regime does not care if you are sincere, but only care about whether you are obedient and cooperative. When the exterior walls of the building and the newspapers are all overwhelming expressions, come to him It's as if there is a cheerleading team, which proves how popular you are. Compared to the police and shots, this is the low -cost maintenance method. "</p>

<p>Political scholars have pointed out that in the current system and political atmosphere, how much the former value can be preserved in Hong Kong will depend on the people's cooperation.</p>
<p>Scholar Zhong Jianhua quoted Harveil's claim that in the post -ending era, "Living Intruth", "Hong Kong has no room for space, and now rely on overseas Hong Kong people to continue to speak and tell the truth." Professor Chen Jialuo believes that it is also a persistence without leaving his position. "The key is how good the people staying, how serious they are."</p>
<p>Middle school teacher Ou said that she should "do less" as possible in the patriotic activities in the school stipulated by the authorities. For example, the weekly flag -raising ceremony should have a "state of the country", and she did not fully implement it. "I have many relatives and friends in the mainland, and some are teachers. They say that schools in the mainland will not say this every week '' national party '. The mainlanders are very smart. Hong Kong is too crazy, too brain, and too stupid. "</p>
<p>Teacher Xu also pointed out that the current teacher's social sciences are light and lightly described on the issue of "violating conscience". "You forced me to talk about the" Color Revolution "in 2019. I really can't tell, so let the students go back to take a note of their own notes. Anyway, this family has been castrated. Why should I be so seriously helping the official 'political propaganda'? Or explain the 'to improve the election system' and 'patriotic governance Hong Kong', and say it as a half joke -if it is used to look at it from a humorous perspective, Hong Kong is very funny now. "</p>
<p>She said that because the trials of the commune department were changed to only two levels of "reaching standards" and "not reaching standards", it was very difficult to meet the standards. The attitude of students in class became perfunctory. "They either do not cooperate, noise rebellion, or they just ignore you and do other subjects. Hong Kong's education system is very utilitarian. The atmosphere of indifference and cynicism is very strong. In the future, a group of smart but no moral elite will be raised in the future. "</p>
<p>Teacher Xu admits that under the current system, it is difficult to inspire students in teaching. She then shifted her focus to extracurricular activities, organized a delegation and workshop for the interested students to cultivate the humanistic spirit of the next generation in limited space. "There are many issues in the society worthy of concern, such as houses, poverty, and environmental protection issues. Take students to understand these, at least let them know how to care for others."</p>
<p>Mid -level civil servant Jing En said that people who are willing to express their loyalty after 2019 are quickly on the top, but not all civil servants must compete for the superiors, and more people are safe and silent.</p>
<p>"It can be understood that the people above should be charming, but we will not obey blindly. The suggestions for handing over will still be written according to professional judgment. If you really want to add political slogans, use a compromise method, add it in an inconspicuous place, and find it. Find it. Numbers (requiring requirements). I don't know how long I can persist, but at least I have to be at ease, don't be too disgusting. "BBC documentary: the battle of freedom in Hong Kong (above)</p>

<h3>China Export unexpectedly falling trade structure in May</h3>
<p>7:27 am on June 9, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-09T07-27-09.000Z/_130041498_gettyimages-1250106326.jpg"></a>Image source, getty images</p>
<p><strong> On June 7, the data released by the General Administration of Customs showed that in the US dollar, China exported 283.5 billion US dollars in May, a year -on -year decrease of 7.5%; imports were US $ 217.69 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 4.5%. The total imports and exports were US $ 50119 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 6.2%. </strong></p>
<p>Compared with the previous months, the data in May is a bit ugly. Beginning in October last year, China's export volume continued to decline. After the release of the epidemic and the Spring Festival, exports began to increase, exports increased by 14.8%year-on-year, and exports increased by 8.5%year-on-year. %.</p>
<p>A report issued by a credit rating agency "Oriental Jincheng" in China believes that the high increase in March was mainly due to centralized production. In April, due to the low base effect brought by the peak of the epidemic in April, the short -term factors in May faded, plus overseas overseas, plus overseas overseas The impact of the decline in demand showed that the other side evidence was the new export order index in the PMI (purchasing manager index) in April and May in April and May continued to be in the contraction range.</p>
<p>In other words, the export volume in March was due to the previous months of backlog order, which was delivered after the Spring Festival; the exports in April were relatively high because the city was closed in Shanghai last April, which caused the export volume last April to be extremely low, which caused this year to 4 this year. The increase of the month seems very high.</p>
<p>The data in May is ugly, and it also has the effect of a certain "high base effect". In April last year, the outbreak of the Shanghai outbreak broke out. The exit of the month rose 14%.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that according to the RMB pricing and the decline in the US dollar, the decrease of 7.5%at the US dollar is 7.5%, and the decrease is 0.8%at a price of RMB, mainly due to the sharp depreciation of the recent RMB against the US dollar.</p>

<p>The Vladivostok is near the junction of Russia, Central, and DPRK. It is facing the sea three, and it is the largest port on the Pacific coast. Since 2022, with the significant increase in trade in China and Russia, the transportation capacity of container ships from the port from the southeast coast from the port from the port from the southeast coast to the Vladivostok port, and the capacity of the ship's return is increasing. Indirectly stimulates the attraction of rotation through the port.</p>

<p>According to the RMB, the import and export of China fell by 5.5%year -on -year in the past May, an increase of 3.6%to the European Union, and a 3.5%decrease in Japan.</p>
<p>At the same time, the import and export of China's imports and exports to Southeast Asian Alliance countries in the past May increased by 9.9%, and Russia increased by 51.9%.</p>
<p>ASEAN also surpassed the European Union and became China's largest trading partner, and the European Union, the United States, and Japan ranked second, third, and fourth.</p>
<p>Except for Russia, China ’s exports to major trading partners in May have declined sharply.</p>
<p>The growth of ASEAN trade is mainly because after the "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement" (RCEP) in the beginning of last year, it has promoted a significant role in promoting the relationship between China and ASEAN trade.</p>
<p>The growth of Russia's trade was that after the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War in February last year, European and American economic sanctions on Russia gradually increased. Russia could not even use the international fund liquidation system (SWIFT) settlement, which caused Russia to increase trade in China.</p>

<p>The main trading country to take care of China is not good. In May, South Korea's exports growth rate was -15.2%year-on-year, and it continued to decline by 0.9 percentage points on the basis of April. In May, Vietnam's exports fell 5.9%year -on -year, and it has declined for four consecutive months.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted analysts saying that in the past 12-18 months, the sharp tightening of global monetary policy, as well as recent pressure on the Western banking industry, has brought anxiety to the road of recovery in China and the world.</p>
<p>In May, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the tenth consecutive time. After the interest rate hike, the Federal Fund interest rate increased to 5.00%-5.25%, which was a new high since 2007.</p>
<p>After the interest rate hike in May, the Fed Chairman Powell said that the interest rate cut is not suitable now. He believes that inflation will decline, but the speed will not be fast, and it takes time to decline.</p>
<p>"If this prediction is generally correct, then the interest rate cut is inappropriate, and we will not cut interest rates." He further stated that if the demand is weakened further, there are more signs of softening in the labor market, so we may consider the interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Federal Reserve ’s interest rate hike is to curb inflation, but after continuous interest rate hikes, it must be maintained at a high level, making the cost of borrowing enterprises and individuals higher, suppressing the needs of major global markets.</p>
<p>Foreign trade data also shows that foreign -funded enterprises are not good in China. In the first five months, foreign -invested enterprises imported and exported 5.1 trillion yuan, a decrease of 7.6%. In contrast , Increased by 13.1%, the import and export of state -owned enterprises was 2.76 trillion yuan, an increase of 4.7%.</p>
<p>Other data also confirms the predicament of foreign capital in China. According to data from the Chinese Bureau of Statistics, the total profit of foreign companies, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan business-investment enterprises in China in January to February reached 35.7%.</p>

The picture shows a press conference held by the Taiwan Executive Yuan at that time.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany) on June 1, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美贸易倡议签署协定-中国批美掏空一中原则/a-65803608">"Taiwan and the United States 21 Century Trade Initiative"</a>After completing the first batch of signing in the United States, a number of Taiwanese media called it "a historic moment"; Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen said the next day that this was since the United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) have broken diplomatic relations in 1979. Established the most complete and comprehensive trade agreement.</p>
<p>Sam Michel, spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative Office, said: "Thank you Taiwan's partners for helping us achieve this important milestone and look forward to negotiating in more trading fields."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美談判21世紀貿易倡議-中國不滿/a-65674861">Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed strong opposition to this</a>It is said that the United States must not have an agreement with "sovereign meaning and official nature of business in Taiwan in China", and the so -called "initiative" is just the guise of the United States under the guise of economic and trade cooperation, "a" command stick "to hit the bone marrow in Taiwan."</p>
<p>As China and the United States exacerbate and the argument between the two parties on Taiwan, does the "Taiwan -American 21st Century Trade initiative" help Taiwan to get rid of China dependence and return to the stage of economic and trade? Or is its diplomatic achievements not true?</p>
<p>DW sort out the three of the questions worthy of attention:</p>
<h3>1. Political gold content is greater than economic benefits?</h3>
<p>There are 12 issues of "Taiwan -American 21st Century Trade Initiative". The first batch of topics signed on June 1 covers 5 of them, including convenient trade, good legal operations, domestic regulations for service industry, anti -corruption and SMEs, and and small and medium -sized enterprises. It has not involved issues such as "market openness" and "tariff reduction". It has been questioned by the outside world and the content gap between the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and limited benefits.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tomas University in the United States, told DW, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美21世紀貿易倡議首次會談-雙方談了什麼/a-62283581">The current negotiation process</a>It is to ensure that "the two sides can talk about relevant regulations before promoting free trade." Therefore, it is now determined that the initiative is not very effective. "It seems too fast" should be concluded until later.</p>
<p>In response to Taiwan's suppression of Beijing, it is difficult to join the dilemma of the international multilateral trade organization. The Economic and Trade Negotiation Office of the Taiwan Executive Yuan also issued a statement on the 2nd that the "Taiwan -American 21st Century Trade Initiative" can be used as a path map to promote the trade agreement. Add "Cross Pacific Partner Comprehensive Progress Agreement" (CPTPP)](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英國加入cptpp-下一個是台灣/a-65176941)Essence</p>
<p>However, some scholars expressed doubts about this and criticized it as "idiots to dream." Liu Danian, director of the Regional Development Research Center of the Chinese Institute of Economics, told Taiwan media "Tai Bao" last month that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳洲总理-不太可能支持台湾加入cptpp/a-63810588">I am afraid it is a bit barely helping Taiwan to join CPTPP "</a>Because the United States has withdrawn itself and is unwilling to return to the agreement.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-09T08-16-00Z/62004325_401.jpg" />The Economic and Trade Office of the Taiwan Executive Yuan stated that the initiative will help Taiwan to join the CPTPP. The picture shows Deng Zhenzhong, the general negotiator of the agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台美貿易倡議進入尾聲-媒體為fta鋪路/a-64417376">As for whether this can be signed for FTA for Taiwan and the United States</a>Liu Danian also poured cold water, saying that the current US policy is unwilling to sign the FTA with any country or region. Therefore, unless the US government turns, the outside world should not have such expectations.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhichao, Deputy Secretary -General of the China Economic and Financial Association, recently published an editorial in Taiwan's "United Daily". The United States is unwilling to pay specific actions to support Taiwan to join the international trade organization or sign FTA with Taiwan. " The conference "was worried that Taiwan was scared to the guests, so he did not let the Taiwanese party" enter from the main entrance ", but only" can drink in the side of the side and be addicted. "</p>
<p>However, at the political level, Ding Shufan, an honorary professor of the East Asia Research Institute of Taiwan Politburo, believes that signing the "Taiwan -American 21st Century Trade Initiative" can help soothe Taiwan's "isolation effects" in international diplomacy and economy. He said, "If the United States is willing to sign a FTA effect with Taiwan", even if it is not a real FTA, it is expected to achieve a "demonstration" effect that allows other countries to consider the imperfection of the United States and sign a similar agreement with Taiwan.</p>
<h3>2. Help Taiwan reduce dependence on China?</h3>
<p>Under the strong opposition of Beijing, does Taiwan and the United States sign a trade initiative to imply that we must further stay away from the Chinese market and choose the side stations between China and the United States? Ye Yaoyuan analyzed to DW that the initiative "to a certain extent" helps Taiwan to reduce its economic dependence on China, but it will reduce the items of trade according to the items of trade.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyuan said that in recent years, China's labor costs have risen and cross -strait relations have been tight. In the past, the advantages of foundry assembly have gradually weakened. Therefore, in terms of certain products, "" The dependence of cross -strait has been declining year by year "](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/台灣水果出口中國剩17-日本成最大市場/a-64122060)The signing of Taiwan and the United States initiative only "accelerate"; but for other products that still depend on China, Taiwan must choose "whether to eat China or the US market."</p>
<p>Taking agricultural agriculture, aquatic products, alcohol and other items as an example, in recent years, China has repeatedly repeatedly used unqualified testing and incomplete registration information, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/反制佩洛西访台-中国禁止更多台湾食品进口/a-62693063">prohibiting Taiwan -related products from importing</a>; Even if Beijing denies it, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/解讀中國禁台石斑魚兩岸關係如何影響農水產/a-62120210">But the outside world generally interprets it as a "political means"</a>Essence Ye Yaoyuan told DW that this also shows that compared with the US market, the Chinese market is susceptible to political factors and has high risk; in response to such products, Taiwan can pass through the trade agreement and "transfer mutual dependence on the Chinese market to the mutual dependence to the Chinese market to The United States "" pulls out of China from China. "</p>
<p>*<img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-09T08-16-00Z/18106526_303.jpg" />##### "Lying Gun" in the Political Vortex of China and the United StatesThe General Administration of Customs of China announced on February 26, 2021 that the import of Taiwan pineapple was suspended from March 1. The China State Council said that this is because "the pineapple that has been imported in Taiwan has intercepted the quarantine harmful creatures since 2020", and was worried about a serious threat to mainland agricultural production and ecological security. According to Chinese media reports, mainland China is the most important place for Taiwan's fresh pineapple. The Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party legislators have accused Beijing of "politics discredit". President Tsai Ing -wen expressed his high -profile statement "Topping farmers and eating pineapple together", and said that Taiwan's "all domestic pineapple, about 10 % of exports on the other side."</p>

<h3>Mainland China is prohibited from importing meat from Taiwan</h3>
<p>Zhu Fenglian, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of Mainland China, said on January 27th that the land side strictly prohibited the input of meat products produced or traded in Taiwan. Taiwan has been opened since January, which has been imported from Lickebamine and imported from 3 months old. Zhu Fenglian said that the mainland is strictly forbidden to import meat products containing Lake Dopamine. In addition, Taiwan also has a high -pathological bird flu and other episodes, which is the risk of preventing the epidemic.</p>

<h3>Chinese vaccine cannot come to Taiwan</h3>
<p>The Taiwan MAC said on January 27 that Chinese vaccines are limited by relevant regulations in terms of donation, business models or other methods, and cannot be imported to Taiwan. A spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Mainland said that Taiwan does not use Chinese vaccines mainly due to political obstacles.</p>

<h3>TSMC breaks the supply of Huawei</h3>
<p>On May 15, 2020, the US Department of Commerce stipulated that from September 15th, all non -US chip manufacturers, without obtaining licenses issued by the US government, can no longer provide Huawei with products that use American technology and equipment. This has led to the leader of the semiconductor and chip manufacturing industry. From September 15th, it will no longer supply chips to Huawei and its companies.</p>

<h3>Mainland China Resisting Taiwan Golden Horse Awards</h3>
<p>At the 55th Golden Horse Awards ceremony in 2018, a Taiwan director made a speech with Taiwan's independence. Gong Li, who served as the chairman of the jury, was therefore refused to come to the stage award, and the award -winning filmmakers in the mainland also collectively missed the ceremony dinner. In August of the following year, the National Film Bureau of the Mainland officially announced the suspension of mainland Chinese films and personnel to participate in the 56th Golden Horse Award. The 57th Golden Horse Awards in 2020 also rarely have mainland movies.</p>

<h3>85 ° C volume into the controversy of unification and independence</h3>
<p>During the transit of Los Angeles in August 2018, Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen purchased coffee at the 85 ° C of the Taiwan brand chain coffee shop and signed on a mascot pillow. 85 ° C has been attacked by a large number of netizens in mainland China, and its ordering page of multiple ordering apps in China has also been removed. The company had to come forward to say that "the position that firmly supports the 1992 consensus has never changed."</p>
<p><a href="javascript:void(0);"></a> <a href="javascript:void(0);"> </a> <a href="javascript:void(0);"></a> <a href="javascript:void(0);"> </a> <a href="javascript:void(0);"> </a>From a political perspective, Ding Shufan believes that the signing of initiative with the United States is not the problem of "choosing or not." "Instead of Taiwan must do this", because whether or not this initiative is signed, Beijing will continue to suppress Taiwan's international international internationally. In status, "opposing Taiwan's joining various economic and trade organizations." "No matter what, Beijing will be unhappy," he said.</p>
<p>Ding Shufan takes the "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partner Agreement" (RCEP) as an example. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/rcep正式生效-中国与亚太多国调低关税/a-60307337">China as one of the member states</a>It is resolutely opposed to the addition of Taiwan. Unless Taiwan "in politics", it means that Taiwan must "abandon its own political subject status and completely become another Hong Kong." Hong Kong has applied to join RCEP last year, and is expected to formally approved as one of them in the middle of this year.</p>
<h3>3. Equivalence in the agreement? Taiwan has to follow the rules of the United States?</h3>
<p>Deng Zhenzhong, the general negotiating representative of the Taiwan Economic and Trade Council, accepted an exclusive interview with Taiwan media "The World" magazine in March, saying that the Taiwan -American initiative was like "a set of progressive trade norms" and "allowing countries to compete freely in a fair and fair environment."</p>
<p>However, compared with Taiwan, the United States' provisions in the business law and trade system are more complicated, so the argument that the Taiwanese side must "follow the rules of the United States" and let the United States "give it". The Taiwan Affairs Office of the China State Council has also approved the agreement to "do political transactions in economic and trade coats", which may weaken Taiwan's core industrial advantages and overall economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>In this regard, Ye Yaoyuan held a positive position and believed that the matter should be interpreted as the "laws and regulations" that the two parties must first complete before the trade was further launched. He said that because US regulations are complicated than Taiwan, some production chains and production processes in Taiwan do not comply with US norms. "If this part (regulations) are processed before product exports, it can be accelerated (relatively speaking Product) The process of exporting to the United States. "</p>
<p>Liu Danian said that Taiwan's primary task is to seize the opportunity and put forward more needs to the United States that meet the interests of Taiwan. For example, to enhance the toughness of supply chain and deepen information exchanges, it will not be reduced to the initiative. Taiwan is not very beneficial, but the United States has given Taiwan's "placebo" such as "placebo".</p>

<p>Online videos show that dozens of police officers wearing riot shields and batons Police pushed a group of angry local residents outside the Nagoya Mosque, Yunnan, and threw items to them. Related videos were quickly deleted by Chinese social media platforms. The local government issued a notice on May 28, demanding that those participating in the conflict "immediately stop all illegal and criminal acts."</p>
<p>Many local residents were reportedly arrested by the police. People who live overseas who live overseas told the Voice of Germany that the Chinese authorities are still urging those who have participated in the conflict, and vowed to remove the dome and spire of the mosque according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Maju (transliteration), a well -known Hui activist living in the United States, said: "Local residents still resolutely resist the government's plan to demolish the important structure of the mosque.</p>
<p>The Nama Ying Mosque is not the first Islamic religious place to face local dismantling. In the past few years, the dome and the spire of the mosque in Ningxia, Gansu, Henan and even Beijing have been demolished by the local government, and replaced them with the Chinese roof.</p>
<p>This is part of the Chinese government's "Sinicization" Islamic Program. The plan aims to eliminate the "external influence" in religion and ensure that religion is consistent with the traditional values stipulated by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>DavidStroup, a Chinese political lecturer at the University of Manchester, said: "Many of Xi Jinping's speech stated that he regarded foreign religious ideology or tradition as a threat, and Islam is a very concerned."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-09T09-23-00Z/65774350_401.jpg" />China passed the 5 -year plan of Sinicization Islam in 2019, emphasizing that it is necessary to ensure that Islam is "compatible with socialism"</p>
<h3>China Five -Year "Sinicization" plan</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Chinese official media "Global Times" in January 2019, China passed a law that was designed to "Chinese" Islam in five years in that year, emphasizing that it is necessary to ensure that Islam is "socialist with socialism. Allow".</p>
<p>At a government meeting in September 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated the necessity of ensuring "healthy development of religion". Xi Jinping said in an article published by the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency: "It is necessary to do a good job in the ideological field of ideology and carry out in -depth cultural and relief projects."</p>
<p>In September 2022, the former chairman of the CPPCC Wang Yang, a member of the new leadership team of the China Islamic Association, needs to "deeply promote the Chinese Islamic Chineseization" and "listen to the party's words and follow the party's political position at any time." Essence Hannah Theaker, the historical and political lecturer of the University of Plond Meyscene, pointed out that some mosques in China were demolished and others were merged. This was part of the reduction of the total number of mosques.</p>
<p>Tike said that the Chinese government has also closed many religious schools and institutions, while strengthening ideological control of religious leaders. She told Germany's voice: "These measures are also highly harassed with the mosque community and the non -Han community (especially immigrants)."</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Forced assimilation</h3>
<p>Some overseas Hui Muslims told Germany that many Chinese Muslims could no longer maintain a lifestyle that conforms to traditional Islamic doctrines.</p>
<p>A Hui Muslim Muslims living in Malaysia said: "The Chinese government starts from destroying Muslim religious places and forcing us to assimilate into the religious norms they have established."</p>
<p>Straipp, the University of Manchester, added that Beijing's Sinicization Movement is essentially trying to establish a CCP's approved version of Islam, making the national community a "carrier of party and national values."</p>
<p>Straip told Germany: "We may see an Islamic version approved by the state, which is supervised and dominated by the party's request."</p>
<h3>The re -education camp in the exile Victoria population</h3>
<h3>Beijing to promote "redefining" Islam</h3>
<p>Many activists believe that the Hui Muslims have few room for virginity to resist Beijing's "redefining" of Islam. Ma Ju said that although the local community has some resistance, their resistance is usually very weak. Local governments usually suspend the demolition plan of the mosque, they will not give up completely. ****</p>
<p>He said: "Although the Chinese government will not completely eliminate Islam, they will try to destroy the social cohesion of the Chinese Muslim community, as they do to other organizations and communities."</p>
<p>Sterape believes that due to the lack of synchronization of the Sinicization movement across the country, the Muslim community rarely has the opportunity to organize large -scale mobilization or resistance.</p>
<p>He told Germany's voice: "The plan was first launched in Ningxia, southern Gansu, Yunnan, East China, and Qinghai, just like the community was sinicized, no pre -warnings or opportunities for them to organize resistance." Strapp believes The movement in Beijing may lead to underground Islam.</p>
<p>He warned: "The state will determine the limit of religious freedom and the scope of due scope, which is worrying, because the authorities may mark anything that does not meet the national ideology as potential extremeism, and will not meet the prescribed religious speech It is regarded as a potential hotbed of terrorism or Islamic principles.

In a specific social environment in China.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were science and studies, and today there are college entrance examinations. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution and the resume of the college entrance examination, in June and July of each year, they are fresh graduates and repeat students in high schools. Ten years of cold windows are bitter, and one test is determined. The college entrance examination seems to have become one of the most "ritual sense" of the whole people in China. It is said that the parents of candidates in a city sent their children to the examination room and put on cheongsam, which is looking forward to his son who can "win the flag". Even the police turned on the green lights to go to the wrong test room, opened the road with a motorcycle, and sent candidates to the corresponding test room in time. To be honest, such a scene is unimaginable in the United States or other Western countries. Why do Chinese society value the college entrance examination so? And as a mechanism for further studies, what should be improved and improved? In this "Zhou Jia has something to say" column, Professor Zhou Xiaozheng and I came to talk about the topic of the college entrance examination. There is also Ms. Lilifeng who joined our discussion this time. Ms. Qian was a college student in the 1990s. She graduated from the Department of Economics of Jiangnan University and obtained the MBA degree from the University of Macau. She is currently an independent writer of the media and one of the sponsor of the "civilized living room" of the media.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Tokyo, 9th) Despite being opposed by the opposition party and human rights groups, the Japanese government amended the "Entry and Exit Management and Refugee Identification Law" today, and it will allow the government to deport the country many failures to apply for refugees in the future.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-09T10-02-07-00-00/000000.png" />Prior to this amendment, regardless of the person who applied for a refugee, he could stay in Japan before the result was released. However, as long as she has to apply for shelter three times, "unless there is a reasonable reason", the Japanese government can deport them.</p>
<p>Japanese Minister of Justice Saito said that the revised law will "protect those who need to be protected, while strictly deal with those who violate the regulations."</p>
<p>Saito mentioned that "many people abuse the application of shelter to avoid being deported." It is not really to escape the danger and persecution.</p>
<p>Last year, about 1,500 people applied for asylum in Japan, but Japan only passed 202 applications, but based on humanitarian considerations, 1,760 people were allowed to stay in Japan. Japan also accepted more than 2,400 refugees who escaped Ukraine with different aid structures.</p>
<p>Since 2021, the 33 -year -old Sri Lanka female Wishma Sandamali died in Nagoya's detention center, Japanese immigration detention conditions have been continuously reviewed.</p>
<p>Sanda is not a refugee who applied for asylum. It is reported that she sought police protection due to domestic violence, but was detained because of the expiration of the visa and died in the detention center. Her family subsequently claimed more than $ 1 million to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>According to reports, Santa Marley constantly complained that she had stomach pain and other symptoms, and activists said she did not get enough medical care.</p>
<p>The lawyer of the Sanda Mali family told AFP yesterday that the revised law "is equivalent to (let the Japanese government) have a switch, which can be executed by expelled those who seeks asylum."</p>
<p>He said: "The Japanese refugee review system cannot play a role." Officials will quickly refuse to apply, and sometimes there is no chance of interview.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) On Thursday (June 8), the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously adopting a bill of "ending the status of Chinese developing countries". The bill requires Secretary of State to take policy actions to cancel China's position in "developing countries" in international organizations.</p>
<p>At the end of March this year, the House of Representatives in the United States had been in favor of 415 votes, and the results of 0 votes were passed through similar bills.</p>
<p>Members who support the Act believe that if China maintains the status of "developing countries", China can allow China to enjoy privileges and special treatment in some organizations and treaties.</p>
<p>The voting results of the Foreign Relations Committee paved the way for the review of the Senate. It is unclear when the Senate will review the relevant bills.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-09T10-09-00Z/65558560_404.jpg" />Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin: Is China a developing country and can not be said to the United States</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to the US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee on Friday at the news meeting on Friday. The appreciation of development achievements is affirmative, but the drunkard's intention is not wine. It is to take the status of developing countries that deprives China as a card to curb China's development. "</p>
<p>He said: "As the status of the world's largest developing countries, China has sufficient factual basis and a solid foundation for international law. It is not a bill of money in the US Congress. China is a legitimate right to enjoy it as a developing country. It is not that politicians on the US Congress can be canceled by moving their mouths. "</p>
<p>He also said: "As for the" Chinese use of developing countries to escape international responsibility ", the US member claimed to be advised that the United States does not have to worry about it. The contributions they have made are far more than most developed countries. "</p>
<p>Wang Wenbin also emphasized whether China is a developing country and can not be said to the United States. The United States cannot kill China is still the basic national conditions of a developing country, nor can it stop China's firm pace of national rejuvenation. As the United States hurts China to put on the hats of "developed countries", it is better to take off the hat of bullying over the bullying overbearing overbearing hat.</p>
<p>More reading: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国自民党申请叫停中国发展援助项目/a-51568913">The German Liberal Democratic Party applies for the suspension of China Development Aid Project</a>There is no clear consensus on the definition of "developing countries". According to the division standard of the World Bank in accordance with the division standards of the per capita national total income (GNI), GNI exceeds $ 13205 (2022 standards, updated on July 1st) as high -income economies (developed countries), which is lower than this standard. It is divided into three types: medium high income, low -low income and low income, all of which are developing countries. In 2021, China's per capita GNI was $ 11880, ranking 68th in the world. China also believes that China has not yet reached the threshold of developed countries.</p>
<p>In addition, the WTO (WTO) generally accepts any country claiming that it is a "developing country". Therefore, some countries and regions that have complied with "developed countries" have complied with "developed countries" because they insist that they are "developing countries", so that they have the right to enjoy preferential treatment in the WTO.</p>
<p>China has become the second largest economy in the world, and its economic capacity accounts for 18.6%of the global economic aggregate, second only to the United States. Because of this, the US Congress believes that China should be regarded as "developed countries" and is treated the same as the status quo of the United States.</p>
<h3>The consistency of the two parties in the United States on the issue of Chinese issues</h3>
<p>Although there are many confrontation split attitudes for many issues in the United States Congress, taking a stronger stance on China is one of the few attitudes in the Parliament of the United States in Congress. Reuters pointed out that parliamentarians have proposed dozens of bills aimed at strengthening competitiveness with China.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also consistently through oral voting through oral voting through the "Taiwan Protection and NDATIONAL Resillence Act", which aims to prevent China invading Taiwan in 2023, requires the Washington government Preparation plan.</p>

<p>Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager. Some workers sent a confrontation scene in Douyin <a href="https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA1p7MwZLcIxN-nQUiu8yogLIDKf2PS7Cxw7e6pYJABIY?modal_id=7228898852244376847&amp;relation=0&amp;vid=7228898852244376847">Video</a>Essence</p>
<p>Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.</p>
<p>Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to Wuli Industrial Zone was also the same. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?</p>
<p>It should be asked why!</p>
<p>Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?</p>
<p>As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. <a href="http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm">Company Branch Committee</a>". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.</p>
<p>In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?</p>
<p>With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.</p>
<p>It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor <a href="https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html">Xi Jinping once scolded</a>Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".</p>
<p>What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?</p>
<p>On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.</p>
<p>However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.</p>
<p>According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.</p>
<p>So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?It seems that the people who may be responsible for the release of China Industry.com are precisely some people who are "mediocre and peaceful stalls, peaceful peace, and mixed days." These people only care about publication, and do not care about the lack of missing missions in the living incidents such as Jiaxinguan Plant. They do not care whether the exaggerated achievements have happened in the reports issued.</p>
<p>Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[<a href="http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html">Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality</a>"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.</p>
<p>In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".</p>
<p>In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.</p>
<p>The good situation of enterprises ".</p>
<p>The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".</p>
<p>For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.</p>
<p>The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.</p>

<p>Traveling to Turkey for the second time was three months after the country occurred in the country. One evening in May, the plane landed on Izmir, the coast of the Aegean Sea. This is the third largest city in Turkey and the western town. Because the location is far from the earthquake in the east, it is not affected by the strong earthquake. Before going, although Turkey will hold a general election a week later, it still underestimates the popularity of the wave of elections.</p>
<p>At that time, President Recep Tayyiperdoğan faced a powerful challenge from the opposition. From Izmir Airport to the hotel, I saw the big and small election billboards -buildings and roadside, everybody, everywhere. In terms of quantity, Erdogan and the opposition basically divided into autumn. Put down the luggage at the hotel and go to the nearby seaside Avenue to find a restaurant, and see the three or five locals holding the brand of supporting Erdogan to leave, and realized that this was just participating in the Erdogan election rally. People.</p>
<p>The competition between Erdogan and the leader of the opposition people's alliance, KelmalkılıçdaroğLu, is in a state of heat. A few days ago, they visited Izmier to attend the rally, and Supporters meet. Early the next morning, I was awakened by a big horn in the hotel room the next morning, and it was obviously not from the fixed mosques tower, because the sound was far away. After going out, I saw a promotional car printed with Erdogan's head. It turned out to be a cruise city and built uninterrupted terrain. It seems that Erdogan has made a lot of Turkey, the most secular city of Izmir. effort.</p>
<p>Walking on the streets of Izmir, you will find that many shops and restaurants have the heads of the Republic of Türkiye, Mustafa, MustaFakemalatürk. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Kemal led the Turkish National Movement to establish a government in Ankara with its outstanding ability, and then liberated the entire territory. The Turkish Republic was established, and comprehensive reforms were launched after governing, making Turkey a modern secular country. In 1934, the Turkish Parliament awarded him "Atturik" as his surname, which means "the father of the Turkish".</p>

<p>In Turkey's most secular Izmir, the heads of the founding father everywhere are not surprising. After a few days of observation, I found that almost all the bus door of Izmir was printed with the Kamal statue above the door of the bus, which was a bit amazing. There is also a Memorial Hall of the State Father here. It is an important meeting of the former residences where Kemal lives in Izmier every time I came to Izmier during his lifetime. The house is not very large, and it has completely retained in history. Now it has become a patriotic education base -I saw that several classes in the class were brought to the teachers. The children should be very curious about the founding father. Stop, so lively.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-09T10-19-37-00-00/000183618_piclink.jpg" />The Father of Izmir recovered the scene of Kermal's planned prospects for Turkey (photography: Zichuan)</p>
<p>As a large country spanning Eurasia, Turkey has a long history of history, and has a profound influence in regional and even global. Ephesians near Izmir were one of the earliest settings of the ancient Greeks in the Aegean Sea and later became the second largest city in ancient Rome. The ruins of this port city are now one of the largest and most complete ancient Greek Roman sites in the world.</p>
<p>It is difficult for this ancient city site with a history of more than 3,000 years to personally. Near the site is the legendary former residence of the Virgin Mary, and one of the seven miracles of the ancient world. At present, only one stone pillar is survived after being spliced. Standing here with Shi Zhu, the explanation of the tour guide in the ear, closed his eyes, as if on the long river of history.</p>
<p>I have been to Istanbul half a year ago after a terrorist attack in the city center. I decided to go according to the original plan after careful understanding of the situation. The entire itinerary is just to see the security check when the plane is plane. Everyone's small -bearing chassis is forced to consignment, and there seems to be no other. Several regions in the center of Istanbul were turbulent, and they also encountered passers -by who were passionate and active. At the same time, the depreciation of Liche has caused the low level of consumption, and there is no harm for tourists.</p>
<p>As the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul retained many brilliant relics. The famous St. Sophia Cathedral was born in 537 AD. At that time, the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine Empire. As Istanbul changed its hands in history, the Ottoman Empire was changed to the mosque; No longer a place of religious. And all this was subverted by President Erdogan in 2020 and restored it to Saint Sophia Mosque.</p>
<p>As a mosque, St. Sophia, the door seems to be in line with long lines, free of ticket costs, but you must take off your shoes when you enter the visit. All women must wear headscarves. I have watched some related documentary films taken before 2020. At that time, although it was necessary to buy tickets as a museum, the surface was not the green carpet now, and it was not just one floor on the ground. Ordinary tourists would never have the chance to appreciate the artworks preserved upstairs. And exquisite murals.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-09T10-19-37-00-00/000183619_piclink.jpg" />Inside the Saint Sophia church who was changed back to the mosque, women must wear headscarves (photography: Zichuan)</p>
<p>The change of Saint Sophia from the museum is only one of Erdogan's many controversial measures. Erdogan, who served as Mayor of Istanbul in the 1990s, jointly established the Justice and Development Party AKP from 2003 to 2014. It was also in 2014 that he became the first president of the Republic. After a false alarm of military coup in 2016, Erdogan, after that, through a series of constitutional reforms and re -election in 2018 to make his power monopoly.</p>
<p>Over the years, the policies implemented by Erdogan have become more and more religious and conservative. At the same time, he vigorously implemented infrastructure construction to provide a large number of jobs for the bottom, winning the hearts of the people's hearts, especially the east tend to be conservative. But at the same time, facing high inflation, Erdogan did not accept the suggestions of economists to increase interest rates and increase borrowing costs to increase inflation to cool down, but constantly reducing interest rates -he believes that doing so will stimulate manufacturing and exports. At present, the inflation rate of Turkey has reached 44%, and the cost of living people is increasing day by day. Turkey, who has just experienced the great earthquake, urgently need blood transfusion, but Erdogan has increased the salary of civil servants in order to win votes, send money to retirees, and provide free natural gas to ordinary families. These methods are poured on inflation.After two rounds of voting, Erdogan won the election with a total 52.16%voting. The opposition leader Kellecha Dal Oudo's voting rate was 47.84%. And in my third largest city in Turkey, the most secular Izmir, Klesmuro won 63.3%of the overwhelming victory. Erdogan's vote rate was only 31.5%. Essence When the people always miss the Izmir of the Father Kelly, Erdogan's conservative style could not get the support of most people after all, and no matter how much billboards and publicity cars were running, it would not help. From a nation's perspective, the opposition has won in the coastal area, and the votes from the inland are Erdogan's main force.</p>
<p>For a strong leader like Erdogan, such a result is difficult to satisfy it. A report released by the British "Economist" magazine in the Turkish election believes that Erdogan's victory will lead to Turkey's continued alienation of Europe and the United States. The report successfully predicted that Erdogan was re -elected with a weak advantage, but his leadership of justice and Development Party AKP were still the most party in parliament. The failed to win the people's alliance that challenged Erdogan also means that Turkey returns to the orthodox economic route and seek to reconstruct the connection with Western organizations such as NATO to bubble.</p>
<p>Erdogan said in his victory speech that "only Turkey is a victor", but at the same time, he did not forget to attack the opposition and the country's LGBT community. According to media analysis, Erdogan's re -election will only continue Turkey's human rights and freedom of speech to continue to go downhill, and it is also facing severe challenges in terms of economy. After he took office, the Turkish li La depreciated sharply again, and the pound was currently exchanged for about 26 miles.</p>
<p>The general view is that the inflation rate of Turkey will be kept at a high position for a long time, causing its attractiveness to investors to maintain a weak state, and the economy is difficult to recover. In any case, nearly half of the voters chose Erdogan's opponents. After all, many people have suffered from high inflation in recent years. In addition to those experts who hype finance, foreign tourists may be the biggest winner of the whole thing. The continuous depreciation lira will only make this tourist country favored by more people in the global tourism market. No, I am already planning the next Turkish trip.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) New York Lawyers Steven Schwartz(Steven Schwartz)This week apologized to the judge because he submitted a statement using ChatGPT to help find the writing information.

<p>He accepted the commissioned case was a passenger who took the Columbia Airlines aircraft in 2019. The man believed that he was hit by a metal dinner plate on a flight to New York. Schwartz was commissioned to be reported. The airlines required to be withdrawn on the grounds that they were over time.</p>
<p>When writing case documents, Schwartz used ChatGPT to collect similar cases that have occurred. He chose several examples of supporting cases that still have timeliness as the argument. These include cases of Iranian Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Egypt Airlines. However, neither Colombian airlines nor trial judges cannot find these cases. After that, Schwartz had to respond to admitting that ChatGPT fabricated everything.</p>
<p>Last month, the judge said: "The court is facing an unprecedented situation ... The six cases submitted seem to be a fake judicial judgment." Lawyers involved may face punishment.</p>

<p>On Tuesday (June 6), in a document that was submitted to the hearing, Schwartz expressed deep apologies to the court for his deep regrettable mistakes. He also mentioned that this is the first time he has used ChatGPT, and a child who has been in college recommends this AI to him.</p>
<p>He wrote: "In the legal study of this case, I thought that ChatGPT was a reliable search engine. But now knowing that this cognition is wrong." He also added that he never wanted to mislead the court.</p>

<h1>Why am I optimistic about Apple Vision Pro</h1>
<p>Creator: KEVIN ROOSE</p>

<p>Description: People may think it is too expensive and ugly, and I have always been skeptical of virtual reality, but Apple has a successful history of turning niche products into mainstream products. People have always accepted new things. And change. Jim Wilson/The New York Times Apple launched the Vision PRO virtual reality head wearing equipment at the Global Developer Conference on Monday.</p>

<p>我承认，苹果周一推出 <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20230607/apple-vision-pro-headset-try/"> 融合数码与现实世界的Vision Pro头戴设备</a>At that time, my original idea was: Wow, this thing looks weird.</p>
<p>It's not just me. Social media's response to VisionPro is not friendly. The suspect laughed at the equipment like a ski board goggles, a high pricing ($ 3,500), and laughed at Apple's high -profile publicity (the company said that VisionPro announced the advent of the "space computing" era). Someone compared it with the robot Wall-E, and some people compiled the paragraphs of watching virtual reality pornographic works on Twitter.</p>
<p>I know. Over the years, I have always been skeptical of virtual reality. I have always wanted to know that when the quality of the equipment is continuously improved, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/technology/virtual-reality.html">why this technology has not become the mainstream</a>Essence I always have skepticism of the Yuan universe promoted by Zuckerberg, and that thing has more "personal conquest", not "actual market demand". If someone asks me before the press conference on Monday, how to look at Apple's hybrid head wearing device, whether it is like the arrival of the first generation of iPhone, marking the beginning of a huge, overwhelming platform change, I will give negative Answer.</p>
<p>But I watched Apple's Vision Pro demonstration on Monday and read the trials <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23750003/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-the-best-headset-demo-ever">universal</a>Give <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/first-impressions-yes-apple-vision-pro-works-and-yes-its-good/">front</a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-vision-pro-i-tried-the-new-mixed-reality-headset-f49a8811?mod=hp_lead_pos5"> evaluate</a>Later, I now feel that this may be a big event, or even the initial signs of a revolutionary new computing platform.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>There are many reasons why VisionPro may fail. People may feel that it is too expensive, too ugly, and too isolated from the world. Personal developers developed well -developed and useful smartphone applications are much easier to write applications for device writing for them to be tied to the user's head. Users who have never really reached a significant scale with obvious significance. Apple may find that Meta has found out what has been discovered so far when entering the product of productive forces based on productivity (referred to as VR) applications: not many people in the world are interested in reading emails in VR.</p>
<p>But I can't rule out such a possibility: Although it is limited to use -for example, you need to carry related battery packs with you -but Vision Pro may be successful.</p>
<p>Is it expensive? Yes. But <a href="https://twitter.com/BetterCity/status/1665831710112530432">the first generation of many equipment</a>It's expensive. The "PRO" in this product's name implies that a model that is not too expensive and more oriented to consumers may be coming.</p>
<p>Is it happy and impressive to use it? The early trials of the product seemed to think so that although they did not use it for too long, and they were a group that was quite excited about new things. The real test will be when users can buy the device -early next year (according to Apple), that is, when people begin to integrate them into daily life.</p>
<p>I admit that I am willing to be open to Vision PRO, partly because of some reason for the technical columnist's "one dynasty was bitten by snakes and was afraid of well rope for ten years." In 2013, I before the first generation of Apple Watch released <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/02/does-anybody-really-want-an-iwatch.html">I wrote an article</a>Confidently declare smart watches a stupid idea. I laughed at their appearance, scolded them as expensive toys, and boldly declared that Apple's large investment in such products was crazy. Except for young and rich Silicon Valley nerds, I couldn't imagine who would use it. (Apple is now the number one watch brand in the world. It is estimated to sell 40 million yuan each year. I wear one now, and many of my friends and relatives are also worn.)</p>
<p>Obviously, my prediction of Apple Watch is an extremely ridiculous mistake. The reason is the following.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>First, I underestimated the market expansion capabilities of Apple to turn niche products into mainstream products. In 2013, there were other smart watches on the market, but there were not many people buying it, so I concluded that there would be no more people buying AppleWatch. I looked at the bulky and ugly smart watch in the market at that time, and believed that those who were willing to wear them on their wrists every day -nerds like me -it was not a market that was enough to make products bigger.</p>
<p>But I ignored the reason why Apple was Apple because it repeatedly proved that it could turn the niche products that the nerd liked by the willpower into what everyone wanted.</p>
<p>It was a testimony of the company's well -known product development and marketing capabilities, and it was part of the reason why I did not want to easily exclude Vision PRO's opportunity.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are several good virtual reality and mixed reality head wearing equipment on the market, and even some good applications. But these devices are not made by Apple, and they are not as seamless to the entire apple ecosystem like VisionPro. At the moment you can open it, you can integrate all the communication records, iMessages, and iOS settings on this hybrid head wearing device on the iPhone. May After the second time, throw into the new toy in the storage room?</p>
<p>In 2013, another mistake I wrote an article in Applewatch was that I forgot that human behavior is not fixed. What do we think about what is regarded as fashion and what is acceptable to society is always with the new The emergence of technology changes.advertise</p>
<p>Our assumption is that those who watch watches at dinner may try to avoid looking at mobile phones, which will be more polite and disturbing others. In other words, there are more people who use it, and the previous taboos do not exist.</p>
<p>The same thing may also occur on the mixed reality head wearing equipment. Of course, wearing VisionPro today may make people feel uncomfortable. But in the next few years, if you have one -third of your colleagues wearing this device to participate in the ZOOM meeting, if you see someone watching VR movies every time you take a plane, you may not think that this device is stupid and stupid. It's right.</p>
<p>Apple has the ability to enter a certain product type at the right time. In 2007, iPhone was not the first smartphone, or even the first touch screen smartphone. IPAD is not the first tablet. But as far as these two types of products are concerned, Apple has brought them excitement and sexy they have never had before. Apple let other companies first make some high -cost mistakes, and then concentrate their strength to create excellent products.</p>
<p>The same thing may also occur on Apple's Vision Pro. Meta, MAGICLEAP and other companies have invested billions of dollars in basic research and development of virtual reality and hybrid reality heading equipment. These companies have learned lessons from the failure of early equipment (such as Google glasses) and conducted lessons. Improvement makes the current header equipment more attractive. But they have not achieved great success in business.</p>
<p>This may be because virtual reality and augmented reality are not fundamentally ideal, so the market for such equipment is destined not to be large.

However, due to the existence of legal gray areas, the German government has limited power to prevent such knowledge from being transferred.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) in Germany has officially launched military training programs with China in the past. Military exchanges technology and tactical experience are common, and it is also common for retired soldiers to bring their unique skills to the private sector.</p>
<p>However, these specifications have now received more attention because they involve China. According to the two ZDFs of the "Mirror" magazine and the public radio company Germany, several German retired Air Force pilots have taken a generous remuneration to China to provide training for their pilots. It is reported that the German security department and intelligence department believes that these retired pilots are likely to leak the secret tactics of military professional knowledge, the German federal army and NATO, and may even simulate the scene of attacks there, which may be right. China is ready to attack Taiwan.</p>
<p>German Defense Minister Pestorius met with Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu on Saturday on Saturday that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/退役军官在华培训战斗机飞行员-德国防部长喊停/a-65827712">he called on China to stop letting retired German fighter pilots with training to China</a>Essence Pestorius said that Li Shangfu's response to this was very reserved: "He did not deny it, but it faded its meaning from his perspective."</p>
<p>In a statement of the German Federal Parliament member Marcusfaber, in a statement issued to the Voice of Germany, he called on "the Ministry of Defense must end up this approach". The statement said, "" For those who are in contact with security related to work for German countries, they need to tighten the rules urgently. "</p>

<h3>The gray zone of the law</h3>
<p>Providing training for Chinese pilots does not violate any law in Germany. This legal gray zone has limited the German government in preventing such knowledge from the transfer of knowledge.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the German Ministry of Defense told Germany that retired soldiers and retired government staff can basically use their professional knowledge freely. They must abide by the "traceability" service obligation, report their work, and "keep the things he or she knows". The Ministry of National Defense will conduct a "conflict inspection of interests". If there is a conflict between interests, they may not be allowed to engage in the work.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense of Germany is worried that Chinese pilots accept not only basic flight guidance, but also information about NATO tactics and combat capabilities. However, it is unclear whether this will constitute a behavior that violates confidentiality.</p>
<p>The South African Testing Flight Academy (TFASA) mentioned in the "Mirror" reported in a statement to the Voice of Germany denied that it endangered the national security of any country. A communication consulting company located in London, a TFASA, said: "All training content and materials are non -confidential content, all provided by the public source or customers themselves."</p>
<h3>China hiring NATO retired pilots may be traced back to nearly ten years ago</h3>
<p>Observer pointed out that hiring NATO retired pilots to train the Chinese Air Force may be traced back to nearly ten years ago, that is, as early as the European Union, the EU qualitative China as a "institutional opponent" or the US national security strategy claims that China is capable and desire to "reshape the international order" to reshape the international order. Before "the only competitor".</p>
<p>However, China has a long history in the successful use of foreign technology to accelerate national strength. The progress of the West in academic research, industry, technology, and intellectual property rights has corresponding objects in China. Su Ziyun, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security (INDSR), told the Voice of Germany, "For the PLA, cooperating with Western retired pilots enables them to improve their theory, which is basically the secret of stealing Western military exercises in Western countries."</p>
<p>Not long ago, news about the British and American retired pilots also provided training for the Chinese Air Force. Like Germany, the British Parliament is now considering tightening the law and supervising the issue. Last year, it has become an Australian citizen <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/路透社涉培训解放军前美军飞官-曾与飞行学校签约/a-63729234">Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Dugen</a>(Danielduggan) is arrested in Australia and may be extradited to the United States. He was accused of signed a contract with TFASA to perform training tasks in China, and he was suspected of conspiracy, weapons trafficking and money laundering.</p>
<p>Du Gen denied any improper behavior, saying that his allegations were due to political motivation, because since his contract ended, US -China relations have deteriorated.</p>

<p>Description: In addition to suppressing the Uighurs in Xinjiang, the authorities have also demolished or forcibly transform mosque and churches across the country. For the residents of the Hui people of Naguka and Shadian town, the transformation of the mosque foreshadows that the government will more comprehensively suppress their lifestyle. Lam Yik Fei for the New York Times 2019, Arabic language on the outer wall of a mosque in a small village in Yunnan, China. As part of government operations, mosque across Yunnan is being closed or transformed.</p>

In the loudspeaker, the paragraph of the Chinese Classic is played. The woman wearing a headscarf took the noisy children from the school. Arabic decoration is coated outside the house.</p>
<p>The Mosque Mosque is towering on all this. The 70 -meter -high white building has a jadeite dome and four mission towers. For decades, this mosque has always been the pride of the Hui people who live here (ethnic minorities who believe in Muslims).</p>
<p>Last month, it also became a scene of conflict.</p>
<p>In the early morning of May 27, when the authorities drove two heavy aircraft into the yard in the mosque, a group of residents conflicted with hundreds of police officers sent to surveillance and demolition projects and riot equipment. The police blocked the mosque and sprayed pepper water to the protesters, and the residents threw water bottles and bricks at the police.</p>
<p>Through the description of the witnesses in the interview and the videos posted on social media, we can understand these rare conflicts. They show that they may sometimes appear more turbulent in the Chinese Communist Party's strengthening of religious control operations.</p>
<p>Since Chinese leaders Xi Jinping came to power more than ten years ago, the CCP in the name of political security <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20180926/china-vatican-agreement-appoint-catholic-bishops/">demolition</a>After the Christian church, I was packed <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20161129/china-takes-a-chain-saw-to-a-center-of-tibetan-buddhism/">the residence of Tibetan Buddhists</a>And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/zh/2019/11/16/world/asia/xinjiang-documents-chinese.html">close Uyghur Muslims into the detention camp</a>Essence But it also hit some groups that have received less attention, including the Hui people. The proportion of Hui people accounts for less than 1%, and the Han nationality with the most population in history is good.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of China has a planned manner <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20190923/china-islam-crackdown/">Close, remove, or forcibly redesign the mosque in the Hui people of the Hui people across the country</a>The characteristics of Arab architecture such as the dome and Xuanri Tower have evidence that foreign countries have harmful influence on Chinese Islam. The resistance is limited. Nagu's mosque and another large mosque in Shatian Town nearby are one of the only large mosques in China.</p>
<p>However, local officials announced that they planned to demolish the dome of the two mosques and rebuilt the Xuanri Tower in the style of "China".</p>
<p>"We regarded this top as our dignity and freedom. At that time, we chose freely," said Mr. Hui Mena in his 30s, because he was worried about government retaliation, he asked reporters to only give his surname. Like many people in the town, his family helped the recent renovation of the recent renovation of the mosque. Xuan Li Tower was added that time. "Now it means that my rule is on your freedom choice."</p>
<p>The mosque of Nagu and Shadian is particularly important in the history of the Chinese government and Islam that is always conflicting and sometimes coexisting. Yunnan Province, where Nagu and Shadian are, are the provinces with the most ethnic minorities in China, and most people say that the Hui people who speak Mandarin and are known for Muslims have lived in all parts of Yunnan for several centuries. Nagu's mosque was built in the 14th century with a traditional Chinese courtyard style. Muslims in Yunnan are prosperous due to trade with Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Later, the CCP officials after the power regarded religion as a counter -revolutionary forces and began to crack down on it, especially during the ten -year political turbulence period (1966 to 1976), known as the "Cultural Revolution" (1966 to 1976). Muslims in Shadian had a confrontation with the government. In 1975, the army suppressed the local area and razed the town to the ground, causing as many as 1,600 civilians to die.</p>

<p>After the "Cultural Revolution", as China opened to the world, the government had apologized for that massacre, supported the reconstruction of Sandian, and allowed locals -many of them was the first time to travel abroad -built now this. Arabic -style mosque, the largest mosque in southwestern China. The large mosque of the Shadian Mosque is based on the Prophet Mosque of Saudi Arabia, which can accommodate 10,000 people. Officially promoted it as a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>The Najiaying Mosque about 140 kilometers away from Shadian also became larger and the architectural style has changed during this period, becoming an Ajun religious training center. The government did not intervene when the locals stamped the dome to the mosque since the 1980s and add other Arab special signs. In 2018, the local government set it as a cultural relic.</p>

<p>"These mosques are a symbol of mistakes that they have made mistakes during the Cultural Revolution."(https://wcfia.harvard.edu/people/ruslan-yusupov)explain. Especially the mosque of Shadian, he said that it was "both about violence and recovery of the state support."</p>
<p>But in recent years, the government's restrictions on Islam have begun to become more and more, especially in <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140303/c03kunming/">2014 attacks</a>After that, the attack on civilian incidents at the Kunming Railway Station at the provincial capital of Yunnan Province caused 31 people to die. The Chinese government said that the attacker was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-court-sentences-three-men-to-death-in-train-station-attack-1410531644?mod=fox_australian">once lived in Shadian</a>Uyghur division molecules.</p>
<p>Officials no longer publicize Shadian. Residents said that in Nagu, the authorities banned female teachers from wearing headscarves at school. After the official strengthened the control of education, a volunteer group there no longer provide free tutoring in the mosque.</p>

<p>"Because of these places (in the local Muslims), occupy an absolutely authoritative position, they have to leave the two mosque to the final process," Yusubov said.</p>
<p>For local Hui residents, the transformation of the mosque foreshadows that the government will suppress their lifestyle more comprehensively.</p>

<p>A woman in her 30s who also surnamed Na ("Na" is Nagu's surname) said that she often played and learned in the mosque after he was a child. The neighbors and relatives who have visited university in other parts of China returned to Nagu after graduation, because they like the devout atmosphere of the town, you can teach Muslim values to their children here.</p>
<p>Ms. Na said that if the demolition of the dome is an isolated thing, she can accept: "Our faith is in the heart, it is just a building." But she was worried that the government would not stop there, especially when she saw the authorities adopted the toughness of hardships. After the means.</p>
<p>"The first step is the transformation of the style," she said. "In the second step, he allows each of our buildings to have Arabic, there are at the door, and the roof is also the same. Like the mosque, the Han nationality said on the onion top. Let's write. "</p>
<p>In the face of opposition, the authorities did not give up. A few hours after the conflict started, the police once withdrew from the mosque before prayer at noon. However, the local authorities issued a notice the next day to condemn the "serious cases of seriously obstructing social management order" and promised to "severely crack down." A few days after that, local officials have broadcast the notice loudly in the loudspeaker many times (including late night).</p>
<p>On the social media platform that has been strictly reviewed in China, the comments of Islam have surged, including commentators from the government.</p>

<p>Nagu's residents are still in and out of the mosque, but security measures are tight, and a drone flew over the top. The plainclothes policeman came to the reporter of the Times and sent her out of the town with a car.</p>
<p>The Shadian authorities are also in a high degree of alertness. Officials blocked the Times reporter at the train station, but agreed to bring her to the Daqing Mosque.</p>

<p>"We, for example, the Qur'an, he must have passed it over in our Saudi Arabia, but after in China, it has to make a specific explanation of the development of our socialist society." Said on the square in front of the mosque.</p>
<p>"The government's request to advocate these socialist core values and these positive energy should be integrated with the Gulan," he said.</p>

<p>Li Hengjian claimed that officials were not interfered with religious freedom, and the transformation plan would only be carried out without the consent of the locals.</p>
<p>He also said: "Patriotism is the highest belief in education."</p>
<p>Back to Nagu, the crane stopped in the yard of the mosque after a few conflicts. Mr. Hui residents mentioned earlier said that demolition seems inevitable. But he hopes to allow residents to retain other freedom they are unwilling to compromise. As far as he is concerned, it includes the right to impart religious beliefs to children.</p>
<p>"If you have no ability to protect your bottom line, then you are not the bottom line for others," he said. "He can trample your bottom line again and again."</p>

<p>• Most of the time in 2021, the National Archives has been urging Trump to hand over the materials he took away -according to the Presidential Archives Law, these materials are regarded as government property -Trump in 2022 15 boxes of materials were handed out in January. It was found that these boxes were equipped with high -sensitive materials with confidential labeling, which prompted the Ministry of Justice to conduct an investigation.</p>
<p>• In August last year, the federal agent visited the Malara Hall and conducted a special search and found the materials that Trump could not hand over -a few months ago he received a subpoena, asking for returning All confidential documents.</p>
<p>• The Ministry of Justice has repeatedly questioned Trump's degree of cooperation in recovering these documents, and said that more than 100 documents including confidential labels have been recovered. "No further materials were found.</p>
<p>• Trump is still facing other criminal investigations. These include Smith's survey of Trump's efforts after the election failure, and how these efforts will lead to attack on the parliamentary building on January 6, 2021, as well as a prosecutor in Georgia The crucial survey of the election of the virgin states.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) According to the latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics on June 9, the consumption prices of Chinese residents in May this year only increased by 0.2%compared with the same period last year, which was slightly better than <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/4月通胀继续放缓-中国经济复苏堪忧/a-65603825">April's negative increase of 0.1%</a>Essence At the same time, China's industrial producers' factory prices decreased by 4.6%compared with the same period last year, 0.9%from the previous month, reaching the largest decline since 2016.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that, in view of the at the same time declined with the price of consumer prices, the Chinese economy is facing a lot of <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/世界苦于通胀中国要担心通缩吗/a-65359964">currency tightening risk</a>Essence</p>
<p>Although consumers can benefit from falling prices in the short term, from the long -term period, currency tightening will lead to [economic weakness] at the macro level.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/5月中国官方pmi不如预期-工业尤其堪忧/a-65779681)The decrease in corporate profits or even lost losses, thereby forcing enterprises to reduce salary and even layoffs.</p>
<p>In view of this, many economists have called on the People's Bank of China to use monetary policy means to stimulate the economy. Analysts estimate that China will cut interest rates as soon as next week, and it may reduce the bank deposit reserve ratio in the next few months.</p>

<h3><strong> "National Government" rich, "people's livelihood" lack of money </strong></h3>
<p>Liu Yuanchun, a well -known economist and president of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, specially emphasized at the Lujiazui Forum "Pujiang Night Talk" on June 8th to reduce interest rates to reduce the financing pressure of private enterprises. He pointed out that the current cost of lending in private enterprises far exceeds state -owned enterprises, resulting in most new circulation currencies and loans only circulate within state -owned enterprises, government institutions, and financial systems. He quoted the concept of "common prosperity" that Chinese President repeatedly mentioned, and called on individual households, private enterprises, and small and medium -sized enterprises with a "accounted for 61.1%of the proportion of middle -income people, to increase the direct financial support for them. means". Liu Yuanchun pointed out that the total number of middle -income groups with an annual income between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan has reached 400 million. Properly solving their demands is one of the focus of promoting common prosperity. "</p>
<p>Liu Yuanchun's point of view also echoed Sun Liping, a well -known scholar of Tsinghua University. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/客座评论中国经济处于通缩之谜/a-65389215">The latter said in April this year</a>Although China's currency supply has been increasing this year, it is facing risk of tightening currency. The main reason is that "the market that looks like enough in the market has flowed to high -end manufacturing, government departments, large infrastructure projects, etc. ', The "people's livelihood" part that is linked to the people's daily life has not received enough currency inflow. "Sun Liping believes that to solve the current currency tightening problem, the key is to open up the dual structure of" national economy "and" people's livelihood ". At least the focus of finance should be sinking into part of the "people's livelihood". Do not blindly increase the risk of "stagnation" caused by currency investment.</p>
<h3><strong> Long -term structural problem </strong></h3>
<p>George Magnus researcher at Oxford University China Center(<em>George Magnus</em>)6月9日在接受德国之声专访时则指出，中国结束"动态清零"防疫政策后，其经济复苏的力度并未达到外界的预期。"中国消费者现在尽管愿意为休闲、餐饮、旅游等小额项目多花一点钱，但是在房地产、汽车等大额项目方面并非如此。而在投资以及出口贸易方面，则都有些令人失望。"</p>
<p>马格努斯分析指出，中国消费者的信心不足，很有可能和房地产市场不景气有关，同时也和个人收入低迷有关。此外，经济总体债务水平过高、人口老龄化、过于依赖 <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/调查结束清零后德企对华投资未见起色/a-65860474"> 投资</a>And <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/再度令人失望-中国5月外贸数据大幅滑落/a-65847680">Export Trade</a>Structural problems are also affecting the long -term growth prospects of China's economy. "The previous clear zero -epidemic prevention has exacerbated this trend and enlarged the oscillation of the economy."</p>
<p>The expert who has been studying China's economic issues believes that, given that the real estate industry will become weaker in the future, China urgently needs a new engine of economic growth, "But I can't see anything to replace real estate for a while. So I predict that in the future ten in the future ten The annual growth rate of China's economy can remain at a level of 2%to 3%at best. The government's economic decision -making will still have a significant effect. "</p>

<p>On the eve of the 4th anniversary of the 4th anniversary of the Hong Kong Governor of Hong Kong, Pengding Kang, the Chinese version of the "Hong Kong Diary" with the theme of Hong Kong's sovereignty transfer in Taiwan. During the online sharing conference on Thursday (June 8), Pengding Kang said that he wanted to publish a private diary and borrow the experience of Hong Kong to tell the world that the CCP's commitment to Hong Kong people was just to control Hong Kong people.</p>
<p>Pengding pointed out that when the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred, he had thought about whether China was credible. At that time, it was believed that if China was on the issue of Hong Kong, it would lose the trust of the world. However, Beijing's commitment to violate the "one country, two systems" and "50 years unchanged" have written in the "Sino -British Joint Statement", which has turned Hong Kong into a police society, proving that China is not trustworthy.</p>
<p>Peng Dingkang: "We are thinking if we can trust China or not to really trust China. Unfortunately, the answer cannot be believed in China. I don't think it was easier to China at that time, but it was Xi Jinping's high -voltage era. It must not be. They violate their promises, but not only in the Hong Kong issue, but in any way. "</p>

<p>Pengding Kang said that before the return of returning, he said that he had discussed the rule of law with officials in Beijing. The other party believed that the rule of law in China was the rule of law and was refuted by him. It can be seen from his experience that the Communist Party of China is a totalitarian party that has never been reforming and does not understand the free society and the rule of law. He also specifically mentioned that around 2012, the CCP had conceived Hong Kong, which was ready to enter the Xi Jinping era.</p>
<p>Pengding: "Xi Jinping was afraid of the CCP's loss of control and was afraid that the CCP's control over civic society began to decline. I think at that time, they decided to suppress Hong Kong. I think Beijing wants to see a Hong Kong without Hong Kong people. It is not a police regime, and what will it be. So I hope people can learn from Hong Kong elec in this book. "</p>
<p>He described that Taiwan, like Hong Kong, is an open and free society. It is called on Taiwanese people to use Hong Kong experience as a mirror to see that the CCP promises that Hong Kong's last end.

Earlier, a PLA ’s J-16 fighter also had over the South China Sea and approached a U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft at a close range.</p>
<p>Cheng Xiaonong, a scoreer in the United States, pointed out in the program "Asia I Want to Talk" in this station that in an article published in Hong Kong 01, in an article titled "My Ship ordered to Hit your ship", the signal used by the Soviet Navy when the Soviet Navy met the U.S. military.

This is the international hegemony.</p>
<p>Cheng Xiaonong: "The CCP deliberately did this only one purpose, and wanted to force out of the United States. Use the conflict of force to confirm the international waters that I want to occupy.</p>
<p>The United States has jointly performed the task of crossing the Taiwan Strait with the Canadian Navy. "This is absolutely purposeful, and even a trained war behavior." Song Guocheng, a senior researcher at the National Political Customs Center of Taiwan, was annotated under the show.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T11-44-00-04-00/000004.png" />Song Guocheng, a senior researcher at the National Guan Center of Taiwan Politburo, said that China's provocative behavior is "empty porcelain" and "sea forced ships at sea".(Screenshot)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/hcm-06092023102924.html/5b8b570b8aa0.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T11-44-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> Song Guocheng: China's "touching porcelain" is a quasi -war behavior </strong></p>

"Song Guocheng said.</p>
<p>Song Guocheng believes that China is doing military gambling and confront the United States with enthusiastic nationalism. It requires the sacrifice of dedication, dedication, and no rational estimation. He said that the CCP has not yet understood it, and the United States has the ability to destroy China: "I think the CCP is stupid. The United States is now fully prepared, deployed well, and all preparations for the CCP war.

<p><strong> China has faced the most "stormy waves" in the past seventy years </strong></p>

After provoking the trouble, it cannot be retracted, because the retreat will destroy the legitimacy and legitimacy of the entire Communist Party. For the CCP, it has really entered the most dangerous stage in the 70 years of ruling in 70 years. ","</p>
<p>"Now it can be summarized in eight words: internal and external forced and shaken by rivers and mountains." Song Guocheng pointed out that China ’s domestic economy has declined, two million cities have closed down, youth unemployment is high, salary has declined, foreign exchange loss, foreign capital retreat, and retreat of foreign investment. The domestic crisis has erupted many points; coupled with the continuous deterioration of the external environment, the G7 Hiroshima Summit and even NATO not only limited the collective security in Europe, but also slowly entered the Indo -Pacific region to form alliances with the United States. China is facing unprecedented pressure. He said, "It is now very afraid of overseas forces caused the color revolution. In the previous white paper revolution, Xi Jinping felt the stress and immediately announced the unblocking."</p>
<p>Song Guocheng said that the deepest fear of the Communist Party of China was to enter the back of the Soviet Union, under the persecution of foreign countries at home and abroad, which means that the Communist Party collapses and destruction. Therefore, Xi Jinping's stormy waves are nothing more than a sense of crisis of internal and foreign delineation and shaking in Jiangshan.</p>

Some analysts believe that the "three -headed carriage" that drives the Chinese economy is weak, and the Chinese economy has actually entered a shrinkage.</p>

<p>China's consumer demand has continued to recover. Under the stable market supply, the inflation rose for the first time after three consecutive months.</p>
<p>In May this year, Chinese residents' consumer price index(CPI)The year -on -year increased by 0.2%, consistent with expectations, but the decline in the previous month expanded to 0.2%.</p>
<p>Benefiting from abundant food supply, food prices decreased by 0.7%month -on -month, eggs and pork prices fell 1.3%and 2%, and fresh vegetables fell 3.4%.</p>
<p>However, the industrial producer's factory price index that reflects the cost of corporate costs has declined for eight consecutive months, down 4.6%year -on -year, and the decline is the largest since February 2016.</p>
<p>According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the price of international commodities declined last month, and the demand for markets at home and abroad was weak. In addition, high bases all affect the performance of upstream production prices.</p>
<p>Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said that after the epidemic, the international community originally expected that China would drive the global economic recovery, but things were contrary to their wishes.</p>
<p>Qiu Dasheng: "Although it is said that private consumption has increased at a relatively low base last year. However, imports are basically very weak from the beginning of the year to the present. In terms of export, it is not bad in January, and it will slowly weak. not good."</p>

(Qiu Dasheng is exclusively provided, the shooting date is unknown) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gf-06092023095139.html/m0609gf-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T11-51-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Candidates of financial scholars who graduated from Shandong University said that the "three -headed carriages" that drive the Chinese economy not only exported to the downturn, but also to be optimistic about investment and consumption.</p>
<p>Commander: "In the case of oversupply in the industry, there are basically no fields of making money to invest. Even if there is, it is a low -level duplicate construction, that is, only some state -owned enterprises, the instructions from the Ministry of Finance and the SASAC, will this go like this. To do it, it is basically impossible for private enterprises to invest in these fields. Investment growth will be very weak and even negative growth. It is impossible and unrealistic to rely on investment to drive China's (this year) economic growth. "</p>
<p>In the first quarter of this year, the economy has improved, but the commander said that the Spring Festival that stimulates the economy has passed. It is the off -season of China's consumption, internal demand is weak, and the domestic product of industrial products is blocked. When the supply is greater than the demand, the price is basically not available. The prospect of economic growth in the second quarter was dim.</p>
<p>Commander: "In the case of a sharp depreciation of the yuan. (The people's) purchasing power is not as good as (put money) to stay in the bank better, and there can be some interest. Relying on consumption to drive China's economic growth in the second quarter, it is not possible. Too realistic. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T11-51-00-04-00/000004.png" />Commander of financial scholars (pictured) believes that China is gradually entering the shrinkage and will continue to deteriorate.

<p>On June 8th, the six major Chinese state -owned banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China lowered the deposit interest rate again. Some analysts believe that this helps to lower the cost of debt, and it may also promote the people to reduce savings and stimulate consumption. It is expected that small and medium -sized banks will follow up in the future.</p>
<p>However, Taiwanese economist Qiu Dasheng is not optimistic about this, especially the epidemic has led to a sharp decrease in the income of Chinese people.</p>
<p>Qiu Dasheng: "Even after the epidemic, private consumption has some recovery, but the strength is not strong. In the past few years, there are many problems in China's real estate market. Phenomenon."</p>
<p>Recently, China's currency credit has grown rapidly, and the decline in prices has triggered a discussion about whether the Chinese economy has entered. A report released by the People's Bank of China on May 15 shows that the current Chinese economy has not shrank, but financial scholars are estimated that China has actually entered a shrinkage.</p>
<p>Commander: "Enterprises that support the entire Chinese macroeconomic, including many top 500 companies, can only reduce production scale without improving. If the price of production is reduced and the price cannot be available, more people will cause more people If you are unemployed, the demand of the people will be further reduced. I am afraid that the product demand of industrial producers will be more weak, forming spiral currency tightening. "</p>
<p>Commander warned that China's shrinkage may gradually deteriorate and last for a long time.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Chinese diplomats have frequently met with Europe with Europe in recent weeks, trying to persuade EU officials to cancel trade restrictions on Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The European Commission stated last month that the committee is considering taking restrictions on eight Chinese companies because they "directly support Russia's military and industrial complex."</p>
<p>According to sources, Chinese diplomats have threatened to take revenge measures if they implement these restrictions on this matter for this matter.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to the media's comment request that China will "resolutely safeguard the rights and interests of normal trade in Chinese enterprises."</p>
<p>It is reported that Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang will visit Germany later as planned as he is planned. Hese Powell, head of the European Union's foreign affairs, may also visit China in July. Rotal fronts have brought new complexity to these interviews.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador to the European EU Fu Cong stated in an interview with the Chinese EU website last month that he hoped that the EU would provide evidence to prove that Chinese companies bypassed European sanctions on Russia to support Russia.

<p>These teenagers are forced to take the steps every day in such facilities and are forced to participate in pro -China propaganda lectures and psychological counseling. These facilities also have close surveillance and punishment systems, including separate detention. It is reported that as of April 30 this year, a total of 871 young prisoners participated in the plan, of which about 70%were related to protests in 2019. Some of them are only 14 years old.</p>

She and former Hong Kong Legislative Councilor Luo Guancong, and former Hong Kong Vice Chairman Zheng Jialang formed a preparatory committee, organizing a series of cultural and artistic activities with Hong Kong people from all over the UK.

Xu Liming believes that life and politics are inseparable. Many parents in British Hong Kong people want to let the next generation understand and inherit Hong Kong culture through these activities, and remember the history of Hong Kong people.</p>
<p><strong> Overseas inheritance and promotion of Hong Kong culture </strong></p>
<p>Xu Liming said: "We often say that life is politics. Before in London, 61 Hong Kong people organized a meeting. Everyone had a clear consensus, that is, to do both. Choose. The point is that we can win if we do n’t go out to march. We must pass on our own history. Whether it is our life experience or our beliefs, everything we do is to save on the details of life, and then After your own thinking, then participate in the substantial struggle. "Liu Jiawen explained that in the real environment of the United Kingdom, it is necessary to attract local people with cultural activities, and then explain the political situation of Hong Kong from shallow to deep in order to let them know the Hong Kong community.</p>
<p>Liu Jiawen: "Because Britain itself is already a country with mature democracy and politics, the British in this generation may not be very concerned about politics, and the voting intention may even be lower than Taiwanese and Hong Kong people. Promoting political issues, there is actually no one to ignore it. So why the "Hong Kong March Cultural Festival" must be packaged to be very leisure and culture, that is, I hope to use this packaging to make it easier for locals and non -Hong Kong people to accept it.

<p>However, people in Hong Kong in various places also face different degrees of difficulties. Some representatives of people organizations in Taiwan and Hong Kong reported that because of their status problems, many people in Taiwan and Hong Kong have faced many problems, so they have strong centrifugal power and difficult to condense. Some people have to feel that they may not be able to settle in Taiwan in a few years and have to return to Hong Kong. Therefore, they are also worried about political risks, but their activities in Taiwan and Hong Kong are pace. The people in Taiwan must control the risks of activities in order to allow more Hong Kong people to participate safely.</p>
<p>Xu Liming said that after many Hong Kong people who moved to Britain found a job, they gradually established their own living circles in the local area. After the epidemic, Hong Kong immigrants with low political risks are easier to return to Hong Kong to visit relatives, so they are more self -protection and make them hold activities to organize activities. More and more difficult.</p>
<p>However, Liu Jiawen believes that the biggest problem is between the discrete Hong Kong people and the remaining Hong Kong people, because they do not understand each other: "Hong Kong people who may still be in Hong Kong will feel that the Hong Kong people who leave will no longer feel that they will no longer be left. Again everything in Hong Kong; overseas Hong Kong people may feel that Hong Kong people staying in Hong Kong are yielding. I think this biggest misunderstanding actually requires time and communication to resolve. This is indeed a problem. "</p>
<p>She believes that as the Hong Kong Government continues to narrow the freedom, the Hong Kong people who have received the information will become more and more difficult. Differential Hong Kong people "goal. She is planning the next action with other Hong Kong people, hoping to try to resolve misunderstandings between Hong Kong people.</p>

<p>In the past few days, a Ukrainian teenager has been waiting in the attic, and on the streets of the flooded town in her flood, she is in place with her 83 -year -old grandfather and two other elderly people. Escape the flood brought by the collapse of the catastrophe dam.</p>
<p>However, according to the trapped persons and their desperate Ukraine rescue workers, Oleshki's rescue progress has progressed slowly. This is a town occupied by Russia. It is separated from Hermone and the pre -war population is 24,000. They It is said that the Russian army is seizing the ship of rescue personnel. It is said that soldiers will only help those holding Russian passports.</p>
<p>A volunteer Jacoslav Vasiliyev said, "Russian soldiers stand on the inspection station to prevent (rescue staff) from approaching the most serious areas of affected and take away the ships," and added, "They are afraid of the destructors, they, they, they Doubt everyone. "</p>
<p>Therefore, the 19 -year -old Yaktarina Bart and her three old people just waited, and thousands of people were considered to be trapped by the flood in the flood of 600 square kilometers (230 square miles) in the Hulson area. Officials We said that about two -thirds of the flood areas are located in the territory occupied by Russia.</p>
<p>The people in the attic have no electricity, no tap water, no food, and Yaktarina Bart's mobile phone is out of power.</p>
<p>Yaktarina Bart said in a brief telephone interview, "We are worried that no one will know the news of our death," her voice is trembling.</p>
<p>Yaktarina Bart said, "Everything around us has been drowned," she also said, "I still haven't saved it." She added that her grandfather of the stroke was almost no medicine, and she was with her. The woman is the grandmother of her neighbor, and she cannot act alone.</p>

<p>Victoria Meroorova-Paka said she has been in contact with relatives trapped in flood areas in Germany.</p>

<p>The details of Ukraine occupied by Russia are often unclear. The Associated Press cannot independently verify reports of the detained ships or only Russians have been evacuated, but this statement is consistent with reports from Russian independent media.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast to the Ukrainian control territory that has collapsed and flooded. The authorities there were actively evacuated civilians and transported emergency supplies. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Zelei went to the area to evaluate the loss. Riskov told reporters that Russian President Vladimir Putin "has no plan" to visit the affected Moscow occupation zone.</p>

<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the beginning of last year, the region has suffered huge suffering, and sometimes even suffering from ruthless artillery and missile attacks.</p>
<p>The most recent disaster began on Tuesday. At that time, the dam at the dam of Khahofka Hydropower Station, which is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) at the upper reaches of Aleishki, collapsed, causing the flood to pass through the Dieber River and pass through the front line of the war.</p>
<p>Officials said that more than 6,000 people have been evacuated from dozens of overwhelmed towns and villages on both sides of the river, but for this area where tens of thousands of people lived, the real scale of the disaster was still unclear.</p>
<p>At least 14 people were killed in the floods, many people were homeless, and tens of thousands of people did not drink water.</p>
<p>The flood destroyed the crops, the mines were transferred, causing extensive environmental damage, and laid a foreshadowing for long -term power shortage.</p>
<p>Ukraine said that Russia bombed the dam with explosives, and Russia accused Ukraine with missile attacks to destroy the dam.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a drone from the Associated Press flew over the dams of the dam. No typical bombing traces or shell scars were found. Most of the dam itself was overwhelmed. Therefore, it is difficult to rule out any situation. The dam has also been weakened due to the negligence of the Russians. For a few weeks, the river has been underwriting it. Since the invasion of February 2022, it has been under the control of Russia.</p>

<p>The Japanese government called on families and industries in Tokyo on Friday (June 9) to save electricity in July and August to ensure that the power supply during the summer power consumption was stable, but no digital targets were set.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that last summer, the Japanese government demanded electricity nationwide. According to the forecast of the Japanese Ministry of Industry in May, the electricity demand in most regions this summer is expected to not be more tense than last summer.</p>
<p>However, the Ministry of Industry still decided to require the Tokyo Capital Circle, which is required by Tokyo Electric Power Corporation to ensure that the electricity consumption for two months is maintained in the "reasonable range", because the power reserve ratio is expected to be lower than 5%, which is close to the required required for stable supply. 3%ratio.</p>
<p>If the heat waves in ten years have occurred, it is estimated that the power reserve ratio of the Tokyo Capital Circle in July and August is 3.1%and 4.8%, respectively. The electricity reserves ratio in other regions will be estimated to be more than 5%.</p>
<p>The ratio of power reserves below 3%will face the risk of power deficiency or power outage.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Chengdu is a good place. In recent days, this sentence has been intentional in the Chinese public opinion field. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/国企领导牵手门为何发酵如此快/a-65859788">A section of Chengdu fashion district Taikooli Street shooting video fire all over social media. </a>The length of the video is only more than ten seconds, but tells a love story that wants to say: a middle -aged man in a pink T -shirt and a young woman in a pink skirt holding hands to go shopping in hand. Be careful to persist.</p>
<p>Reality beyond imagination. On the day of the video release, the romantic street shot turned into anti -corruption textbooks. The public account of the WeChat public account of CNPC Beijing Project Management Company stated that Hu Jiyong, the person involved (man), was removed from the executive director, party committee secretary, and general manager of the global project management company, and was verified by the company's disciplinary committee. The woman involved was dug out by netizens. She was a subordinate of Hu Jiyong and an employee of a technical department.</p>
<p>Although Ms. Dong is a "ordinary employee" in a state -owned enterprise, she has been showing off her wealth on social media, and she has hinted that her underground conditions. For example, a message says: "5.20 can't show love, so send a bill of 430,000 a day a day in advance." She then added: "Love is not necessarily happy, but it is very happy to spend 80,000 per month. Obviously, these consumer consumption and show off their wealth still cannot make her happy, but they still have to come out to show off their love.</p>
<p>As a result, the happiest is "eating melon people". Nothing is more happy than looking at the ugliness of the power. The middle and senior cadres of a state -owned enterprise monopoly group are the most suitable onlookers. The bigger "melon", <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察张高丽在哪里/a-60006252">For example, Zhang Gaoli, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee Zhang Gaoli sexual assaulting tennis general Peng Shuai</a>, The authorities do not let it, many people dare not forward it when they see it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-09T13-51-00Z/17665334_404.jpg" />The author of this article, the time review writer Changping</p>
<p>For the authorities, this is a "corruption case" who came to the door, just showing the fierce popularity of anti -corruption operations. Although "occurring or unreasonable relationships with many women" has become the "fine tradition of our party" in the mouth of netizens. However, at the same time, Xi Jinping demanded that "play a unique role of women in social life and family life, and play a unique role of women in promoting the virtues of the Chinese nation family and establishing a good family style." "Playing Primary Three" within the scope allowed by the party is the great achievements of the upper and lower minds, benefiting the country and the people. Ms. Dong's boring showing wealth makes people both angry and unyielding, but some netizens also watched her figure, feeling "which cadre can help this temptation!"</p>
<h3>"The Petroleum Feeling Flowing in the Three Generations of Oil"</h3>
<p>Netizens found that Ms. Dong's richness is not just because of the "Primary Three" -paces who are only relying on "Primary Three" to get rich and get rich? She comes from the "Petroleum Family" of "New China" and is one of the protagonists of the "greasy three generations of petroleum people". In Jinyi jade, she also has her own anxiety. She wrote on social media: "Classmates gathering makes me even more envy. I don't have the power to blow up, starting with the end of the struggle of others. Freedom, but no matter how hard I can work hard to be as good as my father, "," Everything shrouded by the shadow of the mountains is sad. "</p>
<p>This leads to the most valuable discussion in this public opinion, that is, the "three generations of state -owned enterprises" story often reported in the media in the media often reported in the media. There are not only three generations of petroleum people, but also three generations of railway people, three generations of water supply people, three generations of power people, three generations of tobacco people, three generations of bankers, three generations of postal people, third -generation taxi people, four -generation taxpayers ... For example, "Three -generation tobacco inheritance With Watching "," The Petroleum Feeling Flowing in the Three Generations' Blood "...</p>
<p>One generation occupies the position of high -income monopoly industries, and it must be packaged into patriotism education that "moves China". How many children of the bottom family want to help Miss Dong share some "shadows of high mountains"!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-09T13-51-00Z/45047947_401.jpg" />The parents of the time review believers believe that the most valuable discussion in this public opinion is to reveal the bottom of "the oil feelings flowing in the three generations of oil" blood "</p>
<p>Netizens remembered the story of "two generations of courier people": Beidiao rider Qian Qian has been struggling for 20 years, supporting his son Qian Kun University graduated, but it is difficult to find at work. In the end, the father and son became colleagues and took takeaway together. Compared with the structured social injustice, personal struggle is like an egg hit a high wall.</p>
<h3>"Walk with me on the streets of Chengdu/Tiananmen Square"</h3>
<p>The 34th anniversary of the "June 4th" of this public opinion carnival is the 34th anniversary of the "June 4th". In today's Chengdu Taikoo Li, probably no one will remember that at the Cui Jian Chengdu concert in April 1990, Cui Jian shouted, "I hope the gunfire we heard last time was really the last shot!"</p>
<p><strong> Yanshen Reading —— <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察屠杀发生不止一次/a-65819533">Changping Observation: More than once in the massacre</a></strong></p>
<p>A woman who should also be on all media headlines disappeared silently -on June 3, 2023, a brave protestallability of the "Sitong Bridge protest" occurred in Beijing: a woman was in the "Bird's Nest" "(National Stadium) The slogan of the American flag waving on the outer tower is called, calling on" we should be loyal to the correct values, not which political party is loyal. "</p>
<p>Another woman should also be on the top of the hot search for a long time. She is the wife of Ms. Bi, the wife of the well -known blogmine. Mr. Ruan Xiaohuan published a series of articles that criticized the CCP regime. In February 2023, the authorities were sentenced to seven years in prison for inciting subversion of the state power. The second trial was originally scheduled to be completed by May 22. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/编程随想妻子贝女士希望二审公正公开/a-65719245">Ms. Bi called her husband and published information through Twitter accounts, hoping to get the attention and support of netizens. </a>On May 30, Ms. Bei lost contact with the outside world. On June 7, her Twitter account @Ruanxiaohu32309 was canceled. It is reported that she was taken away by the police and controlled by the police.</p>
<p>A Beijing singer Zhao Lei has been on the Internet. Some netizens said that the video of state -owned enterprise leaders this week finally equipped this good song with the best picture. Therefore, this song is popular again. The song sang: "Walking with my street in Chengdu/until all the lights are extinguished, you will not stop/you will hold my sleeve/I will put my hand into the pants/to the end of Yulin Road/sit down/sit down/sit down.

The main reason for advocating the unwillingness to enter the battlefield is "dissatisfaction with social inequality" and "unwilling to fight for those who have vested interests", whether the "patriotism" driven by the official is gradually "losing to the livelihood considerations and considerations of the livelihood of the general public. "Dissatisfaction with the status quo" is worthy of further observation.</p>
<p>The Chinese community network has recently appeared a popular post that expressed "unwilling to fight for the country". The content wrote "If I war, I won't go, and I won't let my children go." The poster said: "I am a person who grows up at the bottom of society. No one remembers us during the peaceful period. It is difficult to think of us when it is difficult. Everyone is difficult, everyone is responsible. For the same treatment, who loves and go, I won't go anyway, and I don’t let my children go anyway. "</p>
<p>This post has aroused heated discussions on the Chinese community network and caused many netizens to resonate. Some people support the postponers' bottom levels without participating in the battle. Some people think that they must strengthen social welfare to talk about whether they participate in the war. "War" is the excellent quality of the Chinese, "if there is a war, call back"; the mainstream view generally believes that "the danger signal of the patriotic feelings is worthy of everyone to be vigilant." Analysis of posts on the Internet said that the reason for this phenomenon is that the people's hatred of selfish selfish and rich, as well as officials' corruption and abuse of law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>Wang Xinxian entitled "<a href="https://ws.mac.gov.tw/Download.ashx?u=LzAwMS9VcGxvYWQvMjk1L2NrZmlsZS9kOGY2NDY5ZS00YmUxLTQ1Y2QtOTllMy0xZThmNTcxOThmODMucGRm&amp;n=MDPov5HmnJ%2fkuK3lnIvlpKfpmbjmsJHnnL7mlL%2fmsrvkv6Hku7vlj4rovL%2foq5bop4Dlr58ucGRm">Recently, the political trust and public opinion observation of the people in mainland China</a>"The article wrote that recently in mainland China has questioned urban management and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察比城管更厉害的农管来了/a-65536214">agricultural management law enforcement</a>Public power such as expansion of public power and retirement Jin Rui decreased in government trust. He observed that: "Due to the highly centralized decision -making decision of the Party Central Committee, the situation of dissatisfaction with the public's dissatisfaction directly point to the Party Central Committee."</p>
<p>The article also analyzed that according to the surveys of international institutions in the past, the Chinese people have a high sense of social security, but in recent years, with the economic downturn, the rise of unemployment, the phenomenon of the epidemic prevention and control, and the epidemic prevention policy The sense of social security of the people has declined sharply. Under the anxiety and conflict of social psychology, "patriotism" even lost to reality.</p>
<p>The author also pointed out that the Chinese government is extremely sensitive to a slightly unfavorable speech and "infinitely outlines." For example, Xiao Guo Cultural talk show actor Li Haoshi (House) mentioned that "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/长平观察两条感觉受到侮辱的野狗/a-65730016">excellent style, can win the battle</a>[<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被指冒犯解放军-脱口秀演员被警方立案调查/a-65638312">Accused of being investigated by the offending the PLA</a>The official media also made a big tart. Wang Xinxian believes that although the current social incidents in mainland China will not be challenged immediately and obviously to the CCP's rule, it will impact the political trust of the people and also laid an unpredictable foreshadowing for future social governance.</p>
<h3>DW Conflict Zone: What is the plan for the European Union if Beijing attacks Taiwan?</h3>
<h3>Cooling for "Wu Tong Taiwan"?</h3>
<p>In recent years, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has continued to heat up. Although the Beijing authorities claimed that they would do their best to strive for peace and reunification, they did not want to abandon the martial arts options. Chinese military aircraft and warships frequently move in the Taiwan Strait. The United States Central Love Bureau (CIA) and other parties are worried about China's force to attack Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan stated that on Thursday (June 8), the J-11, J-16 fighter, bombardment-6 bomber, oil transportation-20 and early warning of various types were discovered. In the air defense identification zone, the Taiwan National Army started the defense system. This is the latest large -scale military aircraft disturbance operation in China.</p>
<p>Although the posts of "unwilling to fight for the country" on the Internet did not indicate why the war was, Taiwanese media and analysts immediately thought of the Taiwan Strait War and evaluated the "anti -war text" on the Internet to reveal the true voice of the Chinese people on the Internet. Essence</p>
<p>In early May, the Taiwan Central News Agency quoted the article "Nikkei Asia", the president of the China Branch, Nakakzer II, pointed out that the Chinese Internet is an eye -catching phenomenon, that is, the debate ban on the unification of Taiwan's unification of Taiwan seems to be lifted; The view that is different from the current wind direction or even taboos has been allowed, that is, it is unrealistic or even dangerous to decide to forcibly unify Taiwan.</p>
<p>The analysis of the article believes that related discussions have always existed on the Chinese network and have not been deleted by the Chinese censorship agency, which clearly shows that the Chinese authorities have accepted this cautious position. "It can be said certain that Chinese leadership high -level intends to spread it, at least to a certain extent."</p>
<p>The Central News Agency quoted that the Japanese authorities said that although the Chinese authorities did not rule out martial arts Taiwan, it was very difficult for Chinese military and security experts to know from past experience. Therefore, it is necessary to temporarily calm down the public opinion boom aroused by the wolf propaganda.</p>

<p>Description: When the Saudi Arabia Minister of Foreign Affairs visited the country this week, Saudi Secretary of State Broskel said that Saudi Arabia still maintains a strong security partnership with the United States, but cooperation with China may also be strengthened. Military experts believe that with the continuous improvement of the security threats composed of Iran and the focus of the United States to the Indo -Pacific region, the Middle East may adjust the security structure and foreign policy. Although China's influence in the Middle East will focus on the field of energy, economy, and diplomatic, the United States also needs to beware of China's future in the field of military security.</p>

<h3>Sad incident</h3>
<p>In view of the security threat of North Korea's ability to develop nuclear weapons to South Korea, in 2016, the South Korean government decided to deploy the US Sad anti -missile system (Thaad). Because its radar has the potential ability of China, it is considered by China to affect its land security. After opposing invalidation, Beijing has taken multiple countermeasures against South Korea, including the prohibited Korean media and artist performances, tourism blockade, etc. These measures also caused Sino -South Korean relations to cool down rapidly.</p>

<p>Because the land that deployed the Sad system was replaced by the Seoul government to South Korea's Lotte Group, the retail giant became the goal of China's official and civil retaliation. For a while, consumers resist Lotte, demonstration protests, and even suppliers to interrupt the supply. Dozens of Lotian supermarkets were "ordered to suspend business." In addition, sales of Korean brands such as Samsung Mobile, Qia Automobile also plummeted. Chinese travel agencies have removed from South Korea to make the South Korean tourism industry impact.</p>

Because the prevention of (epidemic prevention) that affects production and trade has been eliminated, and travel has become smooth. In addition, the savings in Chinese consumers can create a new wave of consumption.</p>
<p>However, the latest survey made in the German Chamber of Commerce (AHK) in China shows that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/调查结束清零后德企对华投资未见起色/a-65860474">the optimistic emotions of German companies in China are fading</a>Essence More than half of the interviewed companies believe that compared with 2022, which is severely bound by new crown epidemic prevention measures, this year will not improve, and business may stagnate, even worse than last year.</p>
<p>The article published by the "South Germany" wrote: "The Chinese export industry, which was once stable as Taishan, is being weakened by global demand. According to the latest data released by the China Customs General Administration, China’ s exports in May were surprisingly decreased by 7.5%year -on -year. Imports have fallen by 4.5%. It must be reminded that China ’s economic metropolis in China was in the urban stage in the same period last year, and the economic data at that time had fallen into the bottom of the valley."</p>
<p>The article wrote: "These have increased pressure on the efforts of national and party leaders Xi Jinping's efforts.(JensHildebrandt)Point out: ‘need to take targeted measures to stimulate consumer confidence. ‘So far, Beijing has been avoiding a large scale to stimulate economic growth. A report issued by Rongding Group pointed out that this is also related to local finance. A large amount of finance consumed during the epidemic prevention period, coupled with the lack of tax revenue, the finances in many places have been exhausted, and at the same time accumulated huge local debt. Therefore, these provinces urgently need new funds from abroad, and they send officials and delegations to overseas to attract new investors. "</p>

Components. And those companies that rely on Chinese components to develop business in other places are looking for suppliers outside China .... In addition, China is used as an export point for other markets. Now No longer attractive. Therefore, new German companies no longer consider entering the Chinese market. "</p>

'The biggest gap to form is the biggest gap. The United States, there are almost all the situations there. 'Telair said. However, he believes that Germany is expected to increase by 5%of China's exports this year.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Hong Kong, 9th) As the new data shows that the US labor market has further tightened, investors will once again optimistic about the US Federal Preparatory Council (FED) meeting next week to suspend high interest rates. Most of the Asian stock markets have raised their response today.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-09T14-32-06-00-00/000000.png" />Market sources expect the Bank of the United States to suspend interest rate hikes this month, prompting the stock market this month to rise most of the time. Lido also includes the U.S. -field resolution to increase government debt upper limit. If the outside world expects that it will be true, it will be the first time that the Fed will stop the interest rate hike loop last year.</p>
<p>However, Canada and the Australian Central Bank raised their interest rates unexpectedly this week, cracking down on market confidence. The dealers are concerned that the Fed will follow up anyway.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the number of people who first applied for unemployment in the United States last week that the United States announced yesterday increased to a new high since October 2021, and it was much higher than the analyst expectations, making investors more believe that the Fed will suspend interest rate increases by July.</p>
<p>Non -agricultural employment data announced last week was interpreted as a strong one on the laborer market, which was enough to suggest that the US economy was in a good state; on the other hand, it was weak enough to make the Federal Standards suspended interest rates.</p>
<p>The US stock market's three major indexes closed yesterday, of which the S &amp; P 500 index entered a bull market. The Asian stock market has risen today.</p>
<p>The Tokyo stock market has raised 2.0%, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets closed up 0.5%, and Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta's stock markets also received red. But Wellington, Bangkok and Manila's stock markets were hacked. The Singapore stock market is closed in a flat disk.</p>

<p>As Tesla's chief executive Musk stepped on Chinese land again, recent foreign companies' executives visited China very dense, causing attention. The executives of these giants express a signal in an appointment, that is,: they are very optimistic about the Chinese market and will continue to develop their business in China. As we all know, due to the tight relations between the United States and China and China's strict zero -zero policy, foreign investment in China has continued to slow down in recent years. Since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has declared welcoming foreign capital. On the one hand, through the amendments to the anti -spy law, foreign companies have limited foreign companies to obtain Chinese information, which once again triggered concerns about foreign investment in China. What opportunities do these giant executives see? How should the Chinese government interpret the repeated attitude of foreign capital? What is the phenomenon of the differentiation of foreign investment in China in the past few years? This program will discuss the above topics. The guests who participated in the discussion were Qin Peng, an economist in the United States.</p>
<p><strong> Foreign executives are optimistic about the Chinese market? </strong></p>
<p>At the end of May, three years later, Musk, CEO of Global electric vehicle company giant Tesla, once again visited its largest production center-China. Musk was received by China's official high specifications. It is said that Musk said that Tesla is willing to continue to expand its business in China and oppose the US -China economy's decoupling. He also said that the interests of the United States and China are inseparable as a conjoined baby.</p>
<p>Musk was one of the first American company executives that returned to China since China adjusted and relaxed the epidemic policy in December last year. In March this year, Beijing held a high -level forum in China. At that time, Apple's CEO Cook attended the forum. Pfizer and CEO of Clean also attended the association.</p>
<p>In addition, the 19th Global China Summit of JP Morgan opened on May 31st in Shanghai. A number of multinational enterprise executives including JP Morgan Chase, Starbucks, Ford, and other multinational enterprises participated.</p>
<p>These international giant executives said that they will continue to be optimistic about the Chinese market and even increase investment in China, saying that the US -China economic decoupling is unrealistic.</p>
<p>On June 5th, Zhou Qiang, director of the Marketing System Construction Department of the Ministry of Commerce of China, said that this year China will continue to expand market access and further cancel or relax access restrictions. At the same time, investing in China ’s annual investment promotion activities to attract foreign capital.</p>
<p><strong> Investment or suppression? The Chinese government's table is different </strong></p>
<p>Although Chinese officials have continuously claimed to reduce the threshold and attract foreign capital, they have different expressions and say one set.</p>
<p>Recently, the relevant Chinese departments have used foreign consultants and consulting work in China as the target of crackdowns. They assault the practice of searches, detention and arrest of relevant personnel, and once again arouse concerns in China to carry out business in China.</p>
<p>Japan's Anstela Pharmaceuticals, Deloitte, Mesi Smart Group, Bain, and Kaisheng Rongying and other well -known companies have been suppressed at intensive this year. The above -mentioned international information companies help foreign companies to evaluate investment risks before investing in a Chinese company.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the April Affairs Amendment, which exacerbated people's anxiety because the law expanded the definition of spy behavior. Employees of foreign companies in the China department may be convicted because of normal business activities, such as collecting information about competitors, markets and industries, and being used as spies. The law is expected to take effect on July 1 this year.</p>
<p><strong> Foreign investment in China presents a differentiation trend </strong></p>
<p>As the Chinese government expands the anti -spy law, the prospects of foreign investment are even more dim. In view of the new restrictions on the US Biden government's preparations for investing in the United States, the relationship with the increasingly tension with the United States may also restrict foreign investment.</p>
<p>The BBC BBC reported that China ’s international revenue and expenditure data shows that Chinese foreign direct investment in 2022 decreased sharply by 43%year -on -year to 190.3 billion US dollars, significantly lower than US $ 334 billion in 2021 and 253.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. It is the lowest level since 2017. International revenue and expenditure is a common indicator for various economies to track foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>According to data from the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization, the Economy of the Seventh -Kingdoms Group, including the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, and Italy in 2021, the total investment in China was only 16.3 billion US dollars, which was less than US $ 24.7 billion in 2020. And the peak of $ 35.3 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>The BBC report also said that foreign companies' profits in China are worrying. According to data from the Statistics Bureau of China, the total profit of industrial enterprises above designated size from January to February was 887.2 billion yuan, a significant decrease of 23%year-on-year, of which foreign companies and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan business investment enterprises decreased by 35.7%, the largest decline.</p>
<p>Hua Ganglin, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said that the global anti -risk capabilities of SMEs and US -funded enterprises are relatively weak, so many of them have been closed in China during the epidemic. Coupled with the strict control of this year, it is even more difficult to enter China's field inspection. New decisions of new or expanding production and investment are even more difficult. Few new companies have entered China.</p>

<p>The Ending China ’s Developing National StatusAct was approved on June 8th. The bill requires the U.S. administrative department to promote policies, and in future treaties and international organizations, they oppose the treatment to China's "developing countries" status. The bill also instructed US Secretary of State to seek to change China's status to "developed countries" through existing treaties and changes in organizations.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin expressed dissatisfaction at a regular press conference on Friday (9th), criticizing "the United States wants to impose a hat of developed countries to China", and deprives the status of Chinese developing countries as "curbing China's development of China's development.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-35-00-04-00/000002.png" />Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, on June 9, 2023 at a regular press conference, expressed dissatisfaction with the US Senate Foreign Committee passing the "End of China's Development Countries" (screenshot of the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-06092023103927.html/kw0609e.jpg">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-35-00-04-00/000003.png)</a>American senators who support the above bill believe that China as the second largest economy in the world, whether it is economy or military scale, is obviously no longer a developing country, but China has long used this identity to obtain in the multilateral agreement for a long time Unfair advantage. Continue to define China as a "developing country", which will only weaken the fact that the Communist Party of China pose a threat to the United States.</p>
<p>In fact, as early as the end of March this year, the House of Representatives of the United States had adopted a similar "PRC Is Not a Developing CountryAct". After the Senate Foreign Committee's proposal was passed, the next step was to wait for all the Senate to review.</p>
<p><strong> How will Brinkeak handle China's "developing country" status? </strong></p>
<p>Li Hengqing, Director of the Institute of Information and Strategy of the United States Non -Government, predicts that the bill will be successfully passed and signed by President Biden to take effect. Next The status of Chinese family, which will first involve China ’s conference fees and corresponding responsibilities.</p>
<p>"China's developing countries (status), its paid fees and responsibilities shall be the responsibility of developing countries, so it is much lower ... As the second largest economy, China must be carried out according to its economic income(contribute)distribute. China(GDP)Only a little lower than the United States, we should share more international responsibilities. "Li Hengqing said.</p>
<p>Li Hengqing believes that, in addition to the special support projects in China in government organizations may be canceled in the future, the US State Department's USAID (USAID) will also take action: "I know, USAID will give Chinese agriculture a lot to China every year. Funding is free, the biggest of which is agriculture. Once it becomes a developed country(status)In the future, these will not be given again, and it will also ask it (China) to make dedication to pay for other countries. "</p>
<p>China used to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a "developing country" to enjoy various preferential treatment. However, the WTO does not have a specific framework to define "developed countries" or "developing countries". In this regard, Li Hengqing believes that because China has not fully fulfilled its commitment to enter the WTO, the current World Trade Organization has been named. The latest Indo -Pacific Economic framework in the United States is targeted at China, and it has actually replaced the WTO.</p>
<p>For the so -called "developed countries" and "developing countries", the international community has no specific definition and unified consensus. Xia Yeliang, an economist in the United States, believes that on the one hand, China spends trillions of dollars to spread coins. On the one hand, the polarization of the rich and poor in China is seriously differentiated, and the economy is severely distorted. There is no need to continue to provide funding from China in the past.</p>
<p>But he also pointed out: "One thing should still make the international community know that China is not a truly developed country. It also has hundreds of millions of poverty -stricken areas and poor people."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-35-00-04-00/000004.png" />U.S. Secretary of State Broskere (Associated Press Picture), which will be visited in China recentlyAccording to the US "Politico", a person familiar with the matter disclosed that US Secretary of State AntonyBlinken plans to go to Beijing as soon as possible next week. This will marked that US officials have visited China for the highest level of China since the visit of the Secretary of State Mikepompeo in 2018. It is reported that the U.S. State Department is still determining the details of Brosky's visit to China. At present, neither the United States and China have not confirmed the news.</p>
<p>Li Hengqing believes that China mistakenly thinks that the United States is trying to please Beijing: "The reason why the United States wants to continue to establish communication channels is to hope not to wipe the guns. Victory. "He pointed out that the basic strategy of the Biden government is that the relationship between the two countries" fight without breaking ":" Always fighting but not broken, now I hope to achieve this, but this is what China does not want to see. "</p>
<p><strong> "Do not seek other countries to choose a border station" US reduction in response to China's threshold </strong></p>
<p>On Thursday, Brinkee said in a question at the joint press conference with Saudi Foreign Minister Ferra that the United States does not require other countries to choose a side station between the United States and China. In this regard, the response of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin is that China is more concerned about how the United States does.</p>
<p>In this regard, Xie Tian, a professor at the University of South Carolina, said: "Of course, Brinken said so to reduce some pressure on US diplomat partners, don't make them feel like being rebelled or left the United States. "</p>
<p>Economist Xia Yeliang believes that although the United States does not require countries to stand in teams, in the face of the Russian -Ukrainian war and the Taiwan Strait, many countries are naturally on the side of the selection: "If China (if) fights in Taiwan, what will the world think? I think I think it is Most countries oppose force to attack Taiwan. This is also a natural form. You said that it is not a standing team, it is also a standing team. "</p>

<p><strong> Wang Juntao: The Chinese Communist Party's suppression of the white paper movement will be born in a group of professional activists </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-37-00-04-00/000002.png" />Wang Juntao, the chairman of the National Committee of the China Democratic Party.(Independent Chinese Pen Club)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/sc-06092023100612.html/738b519b6d9b_72ec7acb4e2d65877b144f1a.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-37-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Wang Juntao, who currently serves as the chairman of the National Committee of the China Democratic Party, has participated in the democratic movement of China in 1976 and 1989. After the White Paper Movement in China last year, he also carried out overseas response activities of white paper sports in the United States.</p>
<p>In an interview with reporters, he talked about the same points in his mind that the CCP ’s anti -democratic movement and white paper movement:" In fact, the resistance movement under any totalitarian system may be different. But the final result is the same. That is, after you and the totalitarian political game, the totalitarian system may be absorbed in the middle of totalitarian politics, or rejection or suppression. Adopt a way to suppress. "</p>
<p>In November to December last year, there were white paper campaigns in many parts of the people protesting the authorities' dynamic clearance policies in China, and some people shouted the slogan "Xi Jinping stepped down, the Communist Party stepped down". After that, although the Chinese authorities have liberalized the control measures of the new crown epidemic, they have also traced and arrested many white paper sports participants. Wang Juntao believes that the CCP's arrest will create a group of activists: "In fact, many visitors in China have been closed several times and became social activists, which is also because of the arrest of the Communist Party. The suppression of exercise will be born in a group of professional social activists and political activists, which are the same as June 4th and other sports that have been suppressed by it. "</p>
<p>Wang Juntao also said that although the social foundation of the 1989 democratic movement is more complicated and extensive than the white paper movement, the two movements were generally found their own venting mouth through the movement. He said: "If you look closely, many people have been angry with the white paper revolution for a long time. Many things have made them go to the streets, and for a moment, they have found something in common. Why are everyone together, because it is all those who have demands acting. "</p>

He said: "Dictatorship is a simple and rude work, and democracy is a relatively technical category. The reason why the Communist regime is anti -democratic and anti -humanity is actually simple and rude, as long as you consider your own small governance group."</p>
<p>Fang Zheng said that under this simple and rude dictatorship, extreme dynamic zero -zero policy and the suppression of the white paper movement will cause harm to the people, but in the view of the CCP, "the loss of the people's interests and freedom The deprivation of life and the infringement of life are not within its consideration. Similarly, the suppression of the June 4th is the same, and the killing of a few people is not within their consideration. This is the arrogance of the power of arrogance of the ruling regime. "</p>
<p><strong> Feng Congde: The Chinese Communist Party has not changed substantially. </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-37-00-04-00/000005.png" />The leader of the 89th Student Games in the California Bay Area, Feng Congde.(RFA Information) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/sc-06092023100612.html/97513b2d-2386-44f9-96bf-d5c10ad2d040.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T15-37-00-04-00/000006.png" /></a></strong></p>
<p>In the view of the 89th Student Games leader who lives in the California Bay Area, when the CCP's senior officials launch the June 4th slaughter and dynamic clearance decisions, there are some differences in the process: "If dynamic clearing zero, now from a limited understanding of a limited understanding, from a limited understanding of understanding Look, it is basically Xi Jinping's dictatorship, but the June 4th slaughter may be a collective decision of the so -called "Eight Old" of the Communist Party of China. In addition to Zhao Ziyang and the other two standing committee members opposed, the old people who listen to the government behind the scenes may be It is the main force to decide the slaughter. "</p>
<p>"Eight Old" refers to a group of CCP veterans, including Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s. Although most of these people do not have a formal position, they have a great impact on the political decision -making of the Communist Party of China at that time.</p>
<p>Feng Congde believes that although the decision -making process of the CCP's senior management in June 4th Likes and Dynamic Cleansing Zero is different, it is only a bit different. The dictatorship to Xi Jinping may be more dictatorship here, and it has become a personal dictatorship. Deng Xiaoping has to listen to the opinion of 'Eight Old ". The entire process of June 4th has a high -level division. Xi Jinping's political opponents are basically cleaned up, and finally Xi Jinping is Xi Jinping. Personal dictatorship. But there is no difference at all, it is a disaster caused by the dictatorship system. "</p>
<p>Feng Congde said that although the Chinese Communist Party's techniques and the international situation have changed, from Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping's CCP, "substantial changes have not changed in my opinion. The fundamental core value and core interests are still consistent, that is, to maintain power. "</p>

<p>According to the Yonhap News Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Chinese ambassador to South Korea on Friday (June 9) to protest the comments of the previous day of South Korea.</p>
<p>Xing Haiming and the largest co -Democratic Party leader in the wild party in the Wild Party on Thursday (June 8) said that the current international situation has evolved in complexity, and China -South Korea relations are still facing external factors. It is hoped that the Korean side can get rid of the interference of external factors when dealing with China. The United States is trying to suppress China, and some people bet that the United States will win and China loses. This is obviously misjudgment and has not seen the general trend of history.</p>
<p>Zhang Huzhen, the first official (deputy minister) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, said in Xing Haiming on Friday that Xing Haiming's statement had "unreasonable provocation" and warned that his remarks may be regarded as a domestic politics to South Korea. The interference violated the Vienna Convention.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on Friday that the current China -South -South relations are facing difficulties and challenges, and the responsibility is not in China. Ambassador Xing Haiming has extensively contacted the Korean government, political parties and all walks of life. It is the responsibility of the Chinese position and the concern of the Chinese position on bilateral relations and common concern. It is hoped that the relevant parties of South Korea will take the proper view and put attention to how to face the problem and achieve the stability and development of Sino -South Korean relations.</p>

<p>According to the Voice of Germany, Wang Xinxian, a special professor of the East Asia Research Institute of Taiwan's Political Science and Technology of Taiwan, wrote in the briefing of the Taiwan MAC in the Briefing of the Taiwan MAC that some "anti -war articles" have recently circulated on the Chinese network and advocated that they are unwilling to fight for the country. Social inequality and dissatisfaction, unwilling to fight for vested interests, and so on.</p>
<p>Wang Xinxian analyzed that the public opinion of mainland China has now declined with government trust, economic downside, unemployment rate, and chaos of epidemic prevention and control have made the public's social security decline. It is not easy to be recognized by the people and laid unpredictable foreshadowing for future social governance.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that although the anti -war text did not indicate any war, the Taiwanese media and analysts immediately thought of the Taiwan war. The Taiwan Central News Agency has previously quoted expert analysis that articles about anti -war have always existed on the Chinese network, but have not been deleted, which shows that the Chinese government has accepted such a view to a certain extent, that is, the unity of military unification of Taiwan is unrealistic. Even dangerous.</p>

The touching deeds of Xu Qinxian, the commander of the Eighth Army, and how Zhang Meiyuan, who became the Chinese Communist Party's June 4th to suppress the "hero" after replacing Xu Qinxian's position, will become a victim of the CCP's struggle within the future. Now to continue to introduce the former commander of the 38th Army at the time, Li Lianxiu, then commander of the Armed Police Force, and the main partners in his headquarters in the Armed Police Headquarters who were unable to execute the June 4th suppression order and were removed from office. That past.</p>
<p>It is emphasized that the March and Eight Army of the year was because the so -called "long live army" from the 38th Army before 1985 to the original number of the 38th Army after 1985 no longer existed. One of the contents of Xi Jinping's content in 2017 was to change the previous 18 groups to 13, announced that in this military -level unit adjustment and formation, based on the 38th Army of the Army, Eighty -two Army. The Military Department is stationed in Baoding City, Hebei Province.</p>
<p>As of 1989, when he entered Beijing to perform the armed suppression mission, the 38th Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army of that year was compiled as five divisions (tank divisions, mechanized divisions, pobic divisions, infantry divisions, artillery divisions), three brigades ( Missile brigades, high artillery brigades, engineering tourism), plus helicopter land Airlines group, as well as anti -chemical regiments, engineering regiments, communications troupes, electronic confrontation teams and other guarantee troops, 86,000 members, belonging to the re -installation group army. Among them, the tank division, mechanization division, infantry division, etc. are all led by Zhang Meiyuan to implement the task of suppressing the suppression.</p>
<p>General Xu Qin, who was replaced by Zhang Meiyuan that year, began to serve as the captain in 1987, and was replaced by Li Jun. And further, Li Junjun replaced Li Lianxiu's position in 1984.</p>
<p>This Li Lianxiu, like Wang Fuxian, who was introduced in the previous article in this column, was the same as Wang Fuyi, a political member of the 38th Army. When he was ordered to enter the DPRK at the beginning of the government, Li Lianxiu's position was already the head of the 38th Army and the 37th regiment. At that time, it was commended by Peng Dehuai.</p>
<p>Li Lianxiu was promoted to the 38th Army's position in May 1978, and was promoted to commander of the Armed Police Force in October 1984. At that time, the armed police were still leaders of the State Council. Prior to the suppression of June 4th in 1989, Li Lianxiu had been awarded the rank of Lieutenant General of the Armed Police.</p>
<p>In the process of writing "Qiao Shi Biography" more than 20 years ago, I interviewed some people familiar with the matter, including those who worked in the Ministry of Public Security and the Beijing Corps of the Beijing Army. According to their memories, in 1989, 6 During the continuous suppression of the day on June 4th to June 4th, the PLA "martial arts" that fired in the city was not an armed police officer under the Beijing Armed Police Force.</p>
<p>At that time, since Li Peng's "martial law order" was released, the Armed Police Headquarters hosted by Li Lianxiu, the Beijing Armed Police Corps, ordered the telephone number of the war -tampered duty class above his detachment to a recording telephone. It can be seen that at the time, the leaders of the Armed Police Headquarters had pre -made a full preparation of the "Sweet Sheep".</p>
<p>On June 3, 1989, the Beijing Armed Police Corps received an action order, asking the PLA forces who entered the city to perform martial arts mission at all costs to complete Tiananmen Square clearance mission on the early morning of June 4. The word "can take any means" in the command.</p>
<p>However, after this order was conveyed, it was questioned by the grass -roots commander and believed that the order was too unsatisfactory. It is required whether the superior is clear whether it is necessary to carry a gun to perform the task. Because before that, the Beijing Armed Police Force did not have a precedent for real bullets when performing a tide task.</p>
<p>The Beijing Armed Police Force feeded the inquiry of the subordinate commanders to the Beijing Municipal Party Committee in accordance with the command procedures at the time, and the answer was ambiguous: according to the execution you understand.</p>
<p>As a result, the troops affiliated to the Beijing Armed Police Force did not exist the fatal weapons in the assault Tiananmen mission from June 3 to June 4, but only held alarm stick and shield.</p>
<p>Afterwards, although in the process of investigating and searching for "motion and riots", the Armed Police Force and the public security system still played an important role, but Jiang Zemin and Li Peng and others both had negative performances on the armed police force and the public security system on the day of armed suppression. Very dissatisfied. At that time, the Thirty -eight Army at that time, although they were awarded because of the suppression, they still strongly questioned the armed police forces that failed to serve as "the pioneer of the road" for the "regular army".</p>
<p>Prior to the "June 4th" incident, the Armed Police Force was named by the State Council in name. In fact, the then Qiao Shi was controlled by the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Committee. Hu Yaobang was the general secretary of the party, because the party inside and outside the party's independence of judicial independence was very high, Hu Yaobang himself advocated the separation of the party and government. Therefore, in order to straighten the relationship, Qiao Shi's leadership of the political and legal system was right in the government system. In April 1986, Qiao Shi also arranged for Qiao Shi to serve as deputy prime ministers in the State Council.</p>
<p>In addition, from the propaganda materials released by the Communist Party of China, it can also be confirmed that the armed police's ownership issues before the June 4th suppression can be confirmed. When the Communist Party of China announced the appointment of the commander and political commissar of the Armed Police Headquarters in 1984, it was said to be "the State Council Decision." However, in February 1990, when Jiang Zemin made a comprehensive cleaning of the leaders of the Armed Police Headquarters, it was renamed "the State Council and the Central Military Commission issued orders."</p>
<p>Before the June 4th suppression, Li Lianxiu, commander of the Armed Police Headquarters, Li Lianxiu's political partner. Zhang Xiufu, the political commissar of the Armed Police Headquarters, was a local public security cadre that was raised by Zhejiang Province of Qiao Shi. Chief of Staff; Zhang Haitian, deputy political commissar and director of the Political Department, was the deputy political commissar of the 39th Army before 1985.The author has disclosed the above content in the book "Biography of Qiao Shi". In the future, those who are familiar with the matter will introduce more related content to the author. More than ten years ago, a mysterious person told the author through a friend of us that he knew more about General Li Lianxiu in the June 4th incident. For details, see the related articles, content of the independent commentators on the Internet. Not big in and out.</p>
<p>The relevant article of the Caotang Ju Shi said: Before the "June 4th" in 1989, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Security were basically paralyzed. The attitude has long been revealed. Li Lianxiu was the most senior spokesperson at the time and the most prestigious Old Army of the Si Ye. At that time, he was in charge of the National Armed Police. At the time of the crisis, Deng Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun did not dare to act lightly.</p>
<p>Caotan Ju Shi disclosed that one of his friends who worked in the second chief of the General Staff were born in the Thirty -eighth Army. At that time, the highest organs of the Military Commission took a few people to the Armed Police Headquarters as an opportunity to contact their important positions to monitor the Armed Police Commander Li Lianxiu. , You can "cut first and then play".</p>
<p>In his article, Caotang Jushi said: On the eve of June 4th, Xu Qin, the 38th Army commander Xu Qin first met his boss during the cure in Beijing, that is, the first 38 army commander Li Lianxiu. During the meeting, Li Lianxiu explicitly warned Xu Qin before the soldiers must be complete before the soldiers, and should not act lightly, suggesting that Beijing Deng Xiaoping violated the regulations, privately used the soldiers to "violate the law and disciplinary", and also informed the opposition from other generals in the army and Zhao Ziyang did not agree to use the use of the army. The inside story of force suppression ...</p>
<p>Whether the content of the article of Shangcaojunjushi is completely true, and after Jiang Zemin came to power, it is an indisputable fact that the political cleaning of the Armed Police Headquarters is not arguing. We introduced the four "ambiguous stances and negative performances" led by Li Lianxiu earlier. After Jiang Zemin took over the position of the chairman of the Military Commission of Deng Xiaoping at the end of 1989, he immediately asked Li Lianxiu and other cadres to be dismissed within three days in the appointment and removal of the cadres of the Armed Police Headquarters in early 1990. Back to the original unit to report. However, their original units have no position, so the four cadres have since been ended in political life. At that time, except for Li Lianxiu's older, the other three were only in their fifty years. This method of processing itself is embarrassing to be the secretary of the Political and Legal Committee Qiao Shi. Soon, Qiao Shi's confidence was relieved, and then the actual power of Wang Fang, the Minister of Public Security Wang Fang.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the outside world saw that Jiang Zemin promoted his relatives in Shanghai to the commander of the Armed Police Force, but did not notice the special background of a deputy commander and a deputy political commissar who was promoted at the same time.</p>
<p>Before the "June 4th" suppression, Wang Wenli, chief of staff of the Armed Police Headquarters, came from the Pingjie District of Beijing Weijing District. This person has been the secretary of Ye Jianying in the past for a long time, and has a deep relationship with Ye Jia. After the "June 4th", Jiang Zemin all withdrawn the commander, deputy commander of the Armed Police Force, all the political commissions, and deputy political commissions, and the chief of staff Wang Wenli not only did not withdraw, but was ordered by Jiang Zemin to be promoted to the first deputy commander. This move has not only successfully entered the power of the Ye family who will be disgusted with the Yang family, but also gives many older secretaries and children a lot of comfort.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jiang Zemin also promoted Xu Guibao, the second political commissar of the former Logistics Department of the Armed Police Headquarters, and directly promoted it to the Deputy Political Commissar of the Armed Police. The background of this person is the former secretary of Li Xiannian's office.</p>
<p>After Li Lianxiu was removed from office, he was collected by the Beijing Military Region because of nowhere to go. After nearly 30 years of "retired cadre", he died in Beijing on November 10, 2019 at the age of 96. One year and two months later, his older level Xu Qin died in Shijiazhuang, Hebei.</p>
<p>In addition to the partner of this year and his partner at that year at that time, he was dismissed because of poor execution of suppression missions. At that time, at least two of the Chinese Communist Party's field system were "not determined and determined to be determined" to perform the suppression mission. The main military and political leaders of the Eighteenth Army.</p>
<p>In this column, this article quoted a paragraph of Liu Asia: the Beijing -Tianjin area is the political and cultural center. People in Beijing are very concerned about politics. The army is not living in vacuum, but also cares about politics. Everyone is a small politician. However, at a critical moment, the more I can't use the Gyeonggi troops. The typical example of the June 4th "38th and 28th Army in the Beijing Military Region ...</p>
<p>The system of the 28th Army had been revoked as early as 1998. Interestingly, if it is judged on the standpoint of maintaining the CCP's regime, then this former 28th Army can be described as a shame and humiliation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. From April to May 1949, the troops were ordered to launch the Kinmen battle, resulting in one of the biggest defeats of the Chinese People's Liberation Army after the Civil War of the KMT. More than 9,000 officials and soldiers who boarded Dajinmen were covered.</p>
<p>In November 1969, the army changed to Houma, Shanxi, and belonged to the Beijing Military Region. After the army was changed in 1985, he was restructured into the 28th Army of the Army.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia records: 1989 <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6">June 4th Incident</a>On the eve, the 28th Army of the Army was ordered to enter <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC">Beijing</a>Execute martial law mission, in <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%A8%E6%A8%A8%E5%9C%B0">Muya</a>Conflict with demonstrations. The group army is also <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B%E6%B8%85%E5%9C%BA">June 4th Qing Dynasty</a>The Group Army, where the Liberation Army lost the most equipment and personnel, lost a total of 76 vehicles, including 34 <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A3%85%E7%94%B2%E8%BF%90%E5%85%B5%E8%BD%A6">Armored Military Vehicles</a>Essence At 5:00 pm on June 4th, the 28th Group Army was withdrawn. The 28th Army became the only martial law forces in the process of the June 4th suppression process that did not reach the designated position. But it is also praised by the conscience as "the only troops without blood."According to Liu Asia, the 28th Army opened to Tiananmen Square on the morning of June 4. The previous night was stunned, and many troops had already captured. The masses stopped the Twenty -eighth Army in Muyidi. He Yanran, the commander of the 28th Army, looked forward to the armored car and said, saying a word: "The green yarn tent everywhere." What do you mean, you see the people have the same as the blue yarn account. Isn't this used as a devil? ... The political commissar also came: "100,000 youths and 100,000 troops." The two were still making poetry there. Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing called the Air Force Wang Hai, and sent helicopters to shout them: "Go forward!Regardless of everything!" He Yanran didn't listen at all, and told the political commissar. In the future, you go to the military court, you go to me. Later, Vice Chairman Liu was very angry and said four words: the turtle did not look at his head.</p>
<p>The different saying of related words related to Wikipedia was that He Yanran was not dealt with by military law at the time, but was just relegated to deputy commanders of the Anhui Military Region.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T16-59-37-04-00/000000.png" />The Chinese authorities have ordered Tibetans to live in the land of colleagues in western China to make a land for the construction of a hydropower dam, forcing them to leave the farmland they need to make a living. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06092023101022.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T16-59-37-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Screenshot of the Voice of Tibet <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-06092023101022.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-060920231022.html/@stream</a>Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, Tibet sends out to invite you to look at Tibet with me. Six miners who have disappeared after the Tibet Mine Cage accident have been unknown. It is understood that in recent years, the mining activities on the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau have increased sharply, followed by pollution and degeneration, which has led to the death of animals. After two years of sentence, Tibetan monk Sonan Garcuo, who had poor health, was released from prison recently. He was imprisoned for "sending money" to the Dalai Lama. In addition, Tibetans in western China were ordered to free up the land to build a hydropower dam. The first stage of the project is expected to start in early June. According to reports, the Chinese authorities have been difficult to improve foreign tourists from Nepal to obtain a Tibetan tourist visa. New rules require face -to -face interviews and fingerprint recognition. In this episode, we will understand these situations together.</p>
<p>Search and rescue personnel are looking for six workers. They disappeared during the crane crash accident during the construction of a Chinese -funded copper ore, copper multi -metallic ore open -air field drainage roadway related vertical well project in Tibet, and disappeared. Essence</p>
<p>On May 14th, the accident occurred in the copper multi -metal mine in the Dragon Dragon Mining Area, Jiama Township, Mozhu Gongka County, Lhasa. China Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. owns 50.1% of the subsidiary.</p>
<p>Six disappeared miners worked at Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group Co., Ltd., a Tibetan Dragon Copper Branch of Zijin Mining Group, and were responsible for project construction. Their names and racial identities have not been announced.</p>
<p>Zijin Mining Group stated in a statement submitted to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on May 15th that after the accident, the dragon copper industry launched an emergency rescue plan and reported the incident to the relevant government departments.</p>
<p>The company said that the dragon copper industry had been discontinued and was investigating the incident, which "caused six employees in Xingwanxiang to lose contact."</p>
<p>The statement said: "The company will continue to pay attention to the incident and fulfill the information disclosure obligation in a timely manner."</p>
<p>Zijin Mining Group has not released any updates, nor does it have an attempt to provide more information.</p>
<p>Researcher at the Tibet Policy Research Institute of India said that the Zijin Mining Group has three locations in Tibet, which has generated nearly half of the company's income.</p>
<p>Since 2006, with the opening of the Golmud-Lhasa Railway line and the planning and promotion of the Chinese government, the mining and mineral exploration of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have increased sharply.</p>
<p>What follows is the increase in pollution and the destruction of the pasture, which prompts Tibetans to protest the harm to the environment and local livestock.</p>
<p>A Tibetans from the area now exiled overseas in the area said that the Chinese government started mining activities in Gyama Valley, Meldrogunkar, Meldrogunkar, in the 1980s, and developed valuable resources such as gold and copper. It is used to produce products that are conducive to the Chinese economy. The source who did not want to disclose his identity also said,</p>
<p>"But this is the cost of the relocation of the Tibetan herdsmen who has degraded the environment and the migration of Tibetan. Forcing Nomads to settle down is a policy that the Communist Party of China has implemented in Tibet for many years."</p>
<p>The person also said that the increase in mining activities also caused environmental pollution and water pollution, and led to the death of animals drinking water. This Tibetan pointed out at the same time,</p>
<p>"For many years, Tibetans in the region have been protesting, many people have been detained, and many people have been imprisoned."</p>
<p>In March 2013, a catastrophic landslide occurred at the operation site of Jiama Copper Gold Mine, causing 83 people to die, most of which were Chinese migrant workers, which caused people's attention to the losses caused by Tibet mining and industrialization.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Tibetan insiders, a Tibetan Buddhist monk who served his sentence to the Dalai Lama and his temple abbot had been released and returned to the temple.</p>
<p>Sonan Gycuo was arrested by the authorities while on vacation in Chengdu on April 3, 2021. Sources said that after serving two years of imprisonment, he was released from Mianyang Prison near Chengdu, Sichuan Province, southwestern China on May 23.</p>
<p>They also said that on May 25, Sonan Garcuo returned to Gelden Temple in Aba County, Sichuan, because of his poor physical condition in prison.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities arrested Johgon, his sister, Ji Ram, and another monk of Gelden Temple, because they were suspected of managing Rosonitomei through the temple to the Tibetan biography of exile in Dallanda, India Buddhist spiritual leaders Dalai Lama and Gelden Rinpoche send money to support.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities believe that it is illegal to contact Tibetans with other exile Tibetans, and it is particularly sensitive to any connection with the Dalai Lama. The Beijing authorities believe that the Dalai Lama is a divisionist and attempts to destroy China's sovereignty by promoting Tibet independence.</p>
<p>The three were sentenced to different sentences, but Ji Renlam was released in April this year. A source who refused to disclose his name for security reasons said that after being discharged from the hospital, Zeren Lam sought treatment in a hospital in Chengdu due to his weakness.</p>
<p>Let Johgon still served his sentence after being sentenced to three and a half years in July 2022. He also strongly opposed the Chinese government's "patriotic education" campaign. A source who understands the situation previously told Radio Free Asia that during the movement, China and Tibetan officials they trusted forced Buddhist monks and nuns to accept the concept of Tibet and China.</p>
<p>When he was young, he became a monk when he was young, and learned Buddhism at Gelden Temple. He obtained Gesai's degree and was a senior degree in Buddhist philosophy. He has served as the head of the Gelden Temple and the deputy director of the Religious Management Committee, and has become a mentor of the other people of Gelden Temple. During the person in charge of Sonan Garcuo as the head of Gelden Temple, the temple had faced the problem of politics, but under his leadership, the temple successfully spent those difficult days. The monks did not suffer much suffering. Essence</p>
<p>China firmly controls the turbulent Tibetan Autonomous Region, restricting Tibetan political activities and the cultural and religious identity of peaceful expression as Buddhists. Tibetans often complain about the discrimination and human rights behavior of the authorities, as well as policies they mean to eliminate their nation and cultural identity.</p>
<p>According to two Tibetans who understand the situation, the Chinese authorities have ordered Tibetans to live in the land of land to build a hydropower dam in Western China, forcing them to leave the farmland they need to make a living."The land confiscated by the Chinese government is a farmland. This is a living by Tibetan people. The authorities have warned the Tibetans not to show any form of condemnation."</p>
<p>Tongren is located in Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China.</p>
<p>The Chinese government's infrastructure and development projects in these regions have caused frequent confrontation with Tibetans. They have accused Chinese companies and local officials improperly seizing land and disturbing the lives of the local people. Many incidents caused violent suppression and protests to be detained, and exert great pressure on the local people, asking them to obey the government's wishes.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter said that the local authorities will complete all the basic requirements of the region within 10 days after the notification date of the notice within 10 days after the notice date.</p>
<p>Another exile Tibetan said that the authorities had begun to confiscate the land, but they had not discussed the compensation issue of the residents who were forced to migrate. The Tibetan who refused to disclose the name for the same reason, said</p>
<p>"In the notice of land acquisition issued by the Chinese authorities, it mentioned that those who need to take out the dam construction area must be prepared to leave. They must not conduct any other construction in the area. Get compensation. "</p>
<p>According to two travel agencies operating in the capital of Nepal, the Chinese authorities have implemented stricter visa regulations and conditions for foreign tourists who want to visit Tibet through neighbors Nepal.</p>
<p>The Chinese government often prevents foreign journalists, non -governmental organization staff, diplomats and foreign Tibetan citizens enter Tibet. International tourists must obtain Tibetan entry permits to enter Tibet, although obtaining permits is usually not a complicated process.</p>
<p>Many foreign tourists get travel permits in Nepal, which is a common starting point for those who plan to visit Tibet.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to enter Tibet from Nepal must organize a group before obtaining a Chinese group visa issued by the Chinese embassy of the Chinese capital of the Chinese capital in Nepal. After obtaining a group visa, you can receive the "Tibet Tourism Certificate" issued by the Tibet Tourism Bureau and arrange travel according to the scheduled itinerary.</p>
<p>Travel agencies said that according to new procedures, foreign tourists planning to enter Tibet from Nepal must arrive in Nepal one week before completing the visa application, and the visa will only be issued to groups with at least four people. Another report of the independent monthly "Tibet Review" said that at least five people were required.</p>
<p>Travel agencies say visa applicants must personally interview and provide fingerprints at the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu. Five days after the background investigation, a Chinese group visa was issued for the approval tourists.</p>
<p>Thamel Tours and Travels, headquartered in Kathmandu, said individual tourists must provide more detailed personal information, such as the school they are studying, and indicate that they intend to visit Tibet.</p>
<p>Another travel agency in Kathmandu told Radio Free Asia that only one foreign applicant who applied for a visa through the agency was rejected under new procedures.</p>
<p>Earlier, foreign tourists did not need to go to the Chinese Embassy in Nepal to apply for a visa to the Tibet. The travel agency arranged a group visa and issued within two days after the application. The "Tibet Review" states that the visa issued may allow only one foreign tourist to go to Tibet because the applicant on the list has not been verified separately.</p>
<p>Three years after the area was closed for three years due to the new crown virus epidemic, the Chinese authorities re -opened the Tibet Autonomous Region to foreign tourists in April this year.</p>
<p>On March 31, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China issued an announcement that China Travel Agency was urged to comply with new regulations and strictly supervise tourism activities through group supervision to promote the country's tourism industry after the new crown virus epidemic.</p>

<p><strong> Tags: Exaggerated misleading </strong></p>
<p><strong> Read after one minute </strong></p>
<p>Seven major industrial countries held in Hiroshima, Japan in late May(G7)The summit mentioned in a statement that countries have concerned about China ’s“ economic coercion ”in other countries in the field of trade. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded that China was the victim of the United States' economic coercion, especially the economic sanctions imposed by the United States, "affecting nearly half of the world's population."</p>
<p>The Asian factual verification laboratory found that the figures mentioned in China's official statement exaggerate the facts. Despite the extensive sanctions in the United States, the number of people affected by it is far from half of the global population.</p>
<p><strong> In -depth analysis </strong></p>
<p>After the G7 summit, leaders of various countries released a joint communique on May 20, which pointed out that all member states will coordinate their actions to curb China's potential "economic stress".</p>
<p>The G7 initiative to curb China's "economic coercion" has long been out first. Therefore, before the announcement of the bulletin, Chinese Ministry of Foreign A spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to the relevant issues at a press conference on May 12. He said that the United States is actually the real economic coercion. Wang Wenbin quoted media reports that "the United States has imposed unilateral economic sanctions on nearly 40 countries in the world, and nearly half of the world's population has been affected."</p>
<p><strong> What sanctions did the United States impose? </strong></p>
<p>US sanctions can be divided into two categories: comprehensive sanctions and sanctions against specific objects.</p>
<p>Senior Researcher of Peterson International Institute of International Economics Gary Hef Bauer(Garyheuf builder)Tell the Asian factual inspection laboratory: "'Comprehensive' sanctions usually refer to measures for interrupt trade flow (imports and exports) and capital flow, which may include freezing and confiscation of assets." This is a typical economic sanctions in most people. That is to implement a wide range of trade ban on a country. For example, the US sanctions on Cuba continue to implement. It can also target key departments or products of a country's economy, such as restrictions on the Russian energy sector after Crimea was annexed by the Cremlin in 2014.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T17-16-30-04-00/000002.png" />In 2014, Ukraine protesters called for sanctions against Russia.

The well -known example of the recent US sanctions includes Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue, who has suppressed freedom of speech;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T17-16-30-04-00/000004.png" />Lin Zhengyue is a public politician who is particularly sanctioned by the United States.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-09T17-16-30-04-00/000006.png" />Vladimir Putin is a public politician with a specific US sanctions.

<p>If a country is only targeted at some people and institutions, instead of being comprehensive sanctions, ordinary people rarely suffer from extensive suffering.</p>
<p>"Named sanctions on several Saudi and Chinese officials have almost no effect on most of their country people." David Portwin, a senior political scientist at the School of Public and International Affairs of Princeton University, told the Asian factual verification laboratory: "Usually targetedness is targeted The sanctions intend to pass a kind of information, not to produce specific economic effects. "</p>
<p>Comprehensive sanctions are not. The United States usually causes high inflation to a country, and isolates the sanctions economy from global supply chain through strong hindering foreign investment. Therefore, it is reasonable that comprehensive sanctions have affected the national population of sanctions and should be reasonable. For example, the Demare's example of the US sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf of 1990 and the sanctions on Iran when the new crown epidemic broke out, which caused a serious shortage of medical supplies and medical equipment.</p>
<p>Hef Bauer said, "For(North Korea, Cuba or Iran)Comprehensive sanctions will definitely worsen the living conditions of ordinary people, so the impact on ordinary people is heavy. "</p>
<p><strong> Does the US sanctions have affected the world's population? </strong>Even with targeted sanctions, Demare pointed out: "As of 2022, Washington has implemented about 70 sanctions plans for more than 9,000 individuals, companies and economic departments." The targeted sanctions database maintained by foreign assets offices Simple statistics confirm more than 9,000 goals mentioned by Demare. As of June 6, 2023, a total of 5,353 entities (enterprises and companies), 4,540 individuals, 740 ships and 377 aircraft were included in the list.</p>
<p>After the overall sanctions and targeted sanctions are summarized, although the affected people are not small, they are far from half of the world.</p>
<p>Hefbauer said: "The" half of the world's population 'is a serious exaggeration. The only major country that has been comprehensively sanctions is Russia. Compared with it, the sanctions on China are relatively light. %Of the world's population is affected by substantial sanctions. "</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Asian factual verification laboratory found that claiming that the current US sanctions have affected half of the world's population an exaggeration, and it is likely to be for political purposes. Although the current sanctions are indeed extensive and as a tool for US foreign policy, the number of directly sanctions or affected people is far less than half of the world's population.</p>

<p>The standard of the overall trend of the stock market and the Pur 500 index finally rose 26.41 points or 0.6 % in the overnight (Thursday). The longest bear market area.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Dow Jones Marketdata, the standards and the Pur 500 Index are in the bear market area of 248 trading days. It is the bear market since the stock market ended 484 trading days since May 15, 1948. Two "long" bear markets.</p>
<p>If it does not include this bear market, in the past, the average bear market lasted an average of 142 trading days. From the lowest point of the bear market to the completely evacuated bear market, it takes an average of 164 trading days. Although it has been separated from the bear market, the standard and the Pur 500 index are still 10.5 % lower than its record closing level set on January 3, 2022, that is, 4796.56 points.</p>
<p>Regarding the difference between the bear market and the bull market, the general use of market participants is to increase from a recent low of 20 %, which marks the beginning of the bull market. On the contrary, if the indicator falls 20 %, it means the beginning of the bear market. In other words, the stock market is either in a bull market or in a bear market, and there is no gray area in the room. The stock market needs to move 10 % or 20 % in the opposite direction to change the state. For the current turning point, many market participants dare not assert that the US bull market is about to begin.</p>
<p>Wu Zhuoyin, a senior economist in the Asia -Pacific region of French Foreign Trade Bank (Natixis), said in an exclusive interview with the Lianhe Zaobao: "From a macro level, it is currently not too early to conclude that the US asset prices return to the bull market. In the pace of interest rate hikes, although the United States inflation began to be controlled, if the data is not as expected, the Fed still has the opportunity to raise interest rates at 25 base points during the year after the hike raising in June. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-09T21-55/000000.png" />Wu Zhuoyin: In the next few months, interest rates have been on, or any single company's profit is not as good as expected. There are risks to increase the opportunity to adjust US stocks. (Provided by the respondent)</p>
<p>Wu Zhuoyin said: "In addition, the trend of U.S. stocks is mainly driven by a small number of large -scale science and enterprises, and the differentiation of differentiation with other companies is becoming more and more obvious. Therefore, the interest rates will rise in the future, or any single company's profit is not as good as expected. There are all. The risk of making U.S. stock adjustment opportunities. "</p>
<p>In an interview, the executive director of the Overseas Chinese Bank Investment Strategy, Vasumenon, also said in an interview: "At present, it is uncertain that the standard and the Poole 500 index have been separated from the longest bear market since 1948. . Although the index has risen by about 12 % so far this year, and investors' optimism of the United States has begun to explode, a large part of the total return of the stock market is Nvidia, Google's parent company Alphabet, and Apple (Apple), etc. A few large technology companies, that is, the boom of artificial intelligence. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-09T21-55/000001.png" />Huasu Mei Nong believes that the boom of artificial intelligence may last for a while. (Provided by the respondent)</p>
<p>Therefore, Huasumi Nong believes that the whether the standard and the Poole 500 index can further rise depends on the performance of technology stocks. Whether the bull market of technology stocks is sustainable is still to be observed. According to past experience, low interest rates and US bond yields are likely to be beneficial to technology stocks. And the boom of artificial intelligence may last for a while. However, investors should still be cautious.</p>
<p>Shi Jianming, the wealth management director of online transactions and investment banks SAXO Greater China, also said: "Although we have been leaving the bear market in technology, the actual data describes different stories. Economic data and our point of view are that Although it does not deny the current momentum of the market, in addition to the trend that may continue to rise in the U.S. market, it may also be the horizontal trend. After all, the macro environment in the future has become more challenging. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/zaobao world/2023-06-09T21-55/000002.png" />Shi Jianming: Among the 11.8 % rebounds of the Standard and the Pur 500 Index this year, more than 80 % are because of seven stocks, including: Metaplatforms, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Nivine. (Provided by the respondent)</p>
<p>Shi Jianming said: "From the perspective of past experience, the Standard and the Pur 500 Index have increased by an average of 9.7 % in a year after leaving the bear market in 26 bear markets (1929 to 2023). However For those, each market cycle is different. In the current market cycle, the market rebound is very narrow, because of the 11.8 % rebound range of the Standard and the Poor 500 Index this year : MetaplatForms, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia. In addition, the valuation of the US market is still at the highest level since 2022. Investors will focus on more defensive investment portfolios and carefully manage management carefully The downside risk of the investment portfolio may benefit more. "</p>
<p>However, Chen Xiyang, chief investment officer of Tiger Broker Singapore, said in an inquiry of the "Lianhe Zaobao" that the worst tight cycle of the global central bank has almost passed. The global market also rebounded from the longest bear market since 1948. The major stock market fluctuations that people see in 2022 are now normalized.</p>
<p>Chen Xiyang said: "With the slow growth of global growth, energy and commodity prices have begun to adjust. Although the yield curve inverted display shows that the mid -term decline may be coming, from the perspective of the strong employment market in the United States, the Fed should be Design for economy 'soft landing'. "</p>
<p>Recently, the US debt limit crisis was resolved at the last moment, but at least three banks in the US banking industry have closed down to form a crisis. Chen Xiyang believes that this is not so easy to resolve.</p>

<p>He said: "Although the possibility of systemic risks in the US banking system is unlikely, the US real estate industry is expected to continue to constitute risks to small and medium -sized banks. In other words, we continue to see opportunities in value and quality risks. Bringing more tough performance. Generally speaking, considering factors such as 'soft landing' scene, interest rate touch and liquidity, it seems to be beneficial to risk assets. "</p>
<p>In any case, the current rebound of the United States is indeed concentrated in a few technology stocks. Whether their rebound will expand to a wider range of US stock markets remains to be observed. What the market is to see is a clearer inflation, interest rate and economic trend. As long as these problems are unclear, the only thing that can be certain is that market fluctuations will continue, and investors will still be careful.</p>
