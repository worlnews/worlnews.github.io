 In the past few years, several LGBTQ groups have been announced by the government for pressure.
(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The "Beijing Comrade Center" (north of the north), which was established for 15 years (north), issued a statement on its social media account on Monday (May 15th), announcing that the center will terminate the operation. After the news came out, many Chinese netizens left a message under their posts to contribute to the organization's contribution to the Chinese LGBTQ community in 2008, and also lamented that they would like group.
Andy (pseudonym), who has long promoted the LGBTQ community movement in China for a long time, said in an interview with DW that it was not surprising that Beitong announced the termination of operations, because in the past few years, several university LGBTQ communities or folk LGBTQ groups were received by the Chinese government After suppression, the LGBTQ society has "no room for doing things." He said: "The North Tong Center mentioned the" force majeure ", which must be the order of the Chinese government to make them unable to continue operation, so I was not surprised by this result."
In 2020, China's largest diversified gender activity "Shanghai Pride Festival" was announced to be suspended without warning on the official website. At that time, speculation was related to the Chinese government's pressure on the host team. 2021, At that time, the accounts that shared the blocked list on WeChat were also stopped.
Andy told DW that he was found "drinking tea" by the local government for holding activities related to the LGBTQ community in the near future and asked what activities he did before, which made him feel that if he continued to do activities in a similar way to do activities In the case, maybe it will start facing the interference of some government Essence He said: "If there are too many participants in the event, it may not work. Recently, I heard that the American consulate is going to do an event and want to invite comrades and friends to participate, but the local comrades did not send the relevant news to the public account of the social media. Because in addition to calling comrades and friends, the organizer of the event is the American consulate. These two factors are inappropriate in the eyes of the Chinese government. "
Lv Xinjie, the "Outright Operation" (OutrichtInformational), the development of the LGBTQ campaign in Asian countries for a long time, said in a DW interview that the various signs of China in the past few years have shown that the end operation of the North Tong Center is inevitable. Many Chinese LGBTQ athletes told her that when an organization cannot operate various activities or has no space to promote affairs, it is very difficult to continue operating. She said, "I feel regretful but not surprised by the news."
同 同: China LGBTQ "Safety Space" 
Lu Xinjie told DW that for the Chinese LGBTQ athletes, the Beitong Center established in 2008 provided a safe space for the community, and had deep ink in terms of consulting, domestic violence and cross -sex equity advocacy. She said: "For the gay movement, it is important to have a safe space, because in the early days of China, when the LGBTQ community office activity, it was stressed in space issues The group can go, and when you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help. This is a very basic service in the gay movement. "
In addition to providing a safe space, Beitong is also a "very stable" role in China LGBTQ athletes. Lu Xinjie added: "When many groups may suffer different pressures, the North Tong Center has always been there, so for Chinese athletes, the North Tong Center stops operations and will make them feel more desperate."
She also mentioned that in the past few years, many Chinese LGBTQ groups, including Beitong Center, intend to terminate operations because they will be concerned as long as they do activities. However, when they want to terminate operations, the Chinese government has repeatedly stopped them from doing so. Lu Xinjie pointed out that the main reason is that the Chinese government believes that once these LGBTQ groups announce the termination of operations, related incidents will cause public discussion. She said: "This is very hard for operators. They can't do things and have to stay there. Now it seems that they have made a decision, but I believe they will find different spaces to continue to promote what they want to do. Work."
Andy also mentioned that because of the earliest establishment of the Beibei Center, the services it launched often promoted LGBTQ institutions in other regions to follow up. He told DW: "In recent years, they have turned to this piece of spiritual consultation, and this field should look very safe. They provide consulting services through friendly psychologists who are friendly to the LGBTQ community, so even if the North Tong Center is closed, these are The service should still exist. "
 Both Andy and Lu Xinjie said that they believed that the Chinese LGBTQ athletes could finally find a way to break through the status quo after working hard for so long and advance the entire movement to the areas that the Chinese authorities are difficult to control.
Where do you go from the Chinese gay movement? 
The LGBTQ organizations across China have been under pressure to be put on pressure by the Chinese government. However, Andy believes that the communication of the LGBTQ community will not disappear because of this, and community members will come up with more and more new activities and communication forms. He said, "On the surface, it feels that the policy has tightened, but this development may be a good reminder for friends of the LGBTQ institution, that is, they need to change their ideas. When the policy has changed, it is more flexible. "
Lu Xinjie also believes that although the termination of the operation of the Beibei Center is a great impact for many people, and the space for LGBTQ exercise can also be more limited, from other perspectives, the LGBTQ movement of China now has lost one of one The clear land is not an absolute bad thing. She told DW: "Now the Chinese authorities are to monitor all kinds of roles they think they will cause social turmoil. Therefore, a specific space will allow the government . If this community becomes a relatively flowing state, I think that in the current atmosphere of China, the LGBTQ movement can produce more appearance, which may not necessarily be bad. "
Both Andy and Lu Xinjie said that they believed that the Chinese LGBTQ athletes could finally find a way to break through the status quo after working hard for so long and advance the entire movement to the areas that the Chinese authorities are difficult to control. Andy said: "There are so many comrades' communities, everyone must have different needs. These things will not continue to operate because of a government policy."

 In 2019, Italy, where debt -owned, became the only country that has developed democratic countries. The only country signed the China Belt and Road Initiative. Critics condemned this plan to buy political influence and predatory "Trojama".
The Belt and Road Agreement in Italy and China will be automatically renewed in March next year. Unless Italy exits before the end of this year, it is not easy to withdraw.
Melonney's Right -wing "Brothers of Italy" won the election last September, and the party was keen to show the Roman authorities' loyalty to the United States, NATO and the European Union.
In terms of whether Melony can get the first White House invitation letter, it is also facing domestic pressure, because political observers believe that the Belt and Road Agreement with a high symbolic significance between Italy and China will become a potential obstacle.
Meloni said during the campaign last year that it was a "serious mistake" to reach an agreement with China. Italy's current Minister of Defense also said that "unlikely" renewed the Belt and Road Initiative.
However, in order to prevent the Beijing authorities from anger the Beijing authorities and the risk of being retaliated by Italian enterprises, the Roman authorities are very cautious about this; under COVID-19 (2019 coronary virus disease) epidemic and Russia suffer from sanctions on the Russian and Ukraine War, Italy Enterprises have been hit.
Meloni said last week that it has not yet made any decisions and said that this situation "must be very careful."

A government source told AFP that Italy would not issue a statement at the G7 summit, but it is expected that without exaggerating the tension, it will discuss how to keep a distance from China.

For example, in the 1989 Tiananmen incident, the impact of the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the persecution of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang, it can be seen that China does not keep up with their promises; now China has frequently disrupted Taiwan with military aircraft ships and cognitive operations against Taiwan. Sri Lanka believes that European countries should take the initiative to take action and respond to China's threatening moves, "because there is no freedom of democracy, nothing is."
The UK has successfully joined the Capital Pacific Partnership Comprehensive Progress Agreement (CPTPP), which is the largest trade agreement involved in Brexit in 2020 after the Britain in 2020. Tellas said that Taiwan ’s application process will be smooth and call on countries to support Taiwan to join CPTPP, because deepening cooperation in the economic and trade fields in the UK, Japan and Canada and Taiwan will inevitably help.
Tellas pointed out that for China's obstruction and threats, European countries should not stand by, not only show support for Taiwan, but also respond to Chinese accountability. The democratic world must work together, "because your future is our future."

Reporter Wang Yun Photography The U.S. Senate Allocation Committee held a hearing on Tuesday (May 16) to hear the report from the 2024 budget of the 2024 budget of the State Council, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Commerce.
Focus on the Chairman of the Foreign Committee of the US and China Competition of the United States and the United States, the President of the US Public House of the United States and the Public Committee of the United States urged to strengthen export control to China * * 
This hearing is the first meeting of the first membership of the US government's budget during the 2024 U.S. government's budget. Austin) and Minister of Commerce Gina Raimondo.
Senator Christophercoons emphasized the significance of the three government members at the same time at the hearing. "At the same time, they actually emphasized that when facing real challenges from China, we need Adopting a joint method to strengthen the national security, diplomacy, development and economic competitiveness of the United States. "
This statement has an extensive response at the hearing on the day. Minister of Defense Austin and several other senators also mentioned that when facing Chinese competition, the United States needs to adopt the power of the "whole government" and jointly the government's various departments.
Budget, still budget 
A problem encountered in the process of the US government's budget in 2024 is that the new House of Representatives of the Parliament proposed a huge budget reduction plan, which brought challenges to the administrative department's plan to deal with Chinese challenges.
 U.S. Secretary of State Broskens arrived at the hearing scene on May 16, 2023 (Reporter Wang Yun Photography) Senior government officials emphasized at the hearing that if sufficient budgets cannot be obtained, it will affect the implementation of relevant policies with Chinese competition.
The Minister of Defense Austin takes the construction of a military ship as an example to illustrate the importance of this budget. "This may affect the $ 9.7 billion budget for improving the construction efficiency of the ship. The second phase of the contract, the construction of the Virginia -class nuclear submarine cannot be started. "
State Secretary of State Brills pointed out that the reduction of budgets may affect the diplomatic goals that have been agreed with the two parties. "More specifically, on the Chinese issue, there are several projects in our budget. Regional influence against China; (budget reduction) will affect us to contact various interests in these places and establish partnerships. "
When the Minister of Commerce Raymond explained this problem, the Ministry of Commerce's Industry and Security Bureau first pointed out(BIS)The importance, "If we return to the situation in 2022, (cut budget) means that we will lack 125 hands, and the work of these people is to verify the user in export control; last year we carried out more than 1,100 in 54 countries. Users verify that most of them are about China. Without these 125 people, we cannot complete these tasks, and American technology will fall into the hands of illegal users in China. "
Budget, or will? 
But the general understanding of some key issues is different. Although the three senior government officials came to the hearing to explain the necessity of budgeting their budgets, some of the senators of government supervisors believed that against countries like China mainly depending on the government's wishes, not budgets.
Senior Senator Lindseygraham, a senior senator in South Carolina, said, "That kind of statement that believes that we have a very strong Chinese policy is nonsense, not to prevent China with a budget. Willing to confront China. "
Graham said, "I have to say that China has intercepted all the topics here!" He emphasized that to fight against China, he should not look at the vacancies on the budget, or how much local diplomats in the United States have. He said, "In my opinion, all we have done in the past two years are just making all bad guys bolder."
But Brinken has previously pointed out that the number of diplomats in China currently in the world is more than 100 more than the United States. In this sense, the United States has deficit in diplomacy. He said that there are many vacancies in US diplomats at present, and 14 diplomat candidates are still waiting for confirmation in the Senate. They have been waiting for a year or longer, and there are 40 in different stages of the appointment process.
Brinken warned that the vacancy of US diplomats will produce vacuum in terms of international influence, and China is filling this vacuum.

Josh Hawley, a US Republican Federal Senator, pointed out that the development scale of the generation AI (Generativeai) is like the Internet, one of the most important technological innovations in human history, and then warned, "This may lead to recruitment Similar consequences of atomic bullets. "
Atman said that the appearance of generating AI is like a "printing machine" and can improve and create work. He emphasized that regulatory measures are essential to risk control, and said Hope to cooperate with the government to prevent problems in new technologies.
Several Congress members and experts may affect the election of the AI system, such as spreading unreasonable messages or manipulating voters, expressing solemn concerns.

 Protestant of tens of thousands of people in Radakh Picture intercept the video uploaded by the people uploaded by the people of Ladaka
Me: There is another point, I wonder if you noticed that the incident of the Internet violent respected incident has aroused the most response, or the most powerful protest is the people in the Himalayas. They rally, march, and emotionally shouting emotionally. Essence Not only Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhist believers, Ladaka has many Muslims, as well as Christians and other religious believers. In other words, not all protesters are Tibetan Buddhists. The historic Ladaka is also a sensitive area itself. It is a sensitive area between China and India today. There are tens of thousands of rallys for Radakhs to protest against the Dalai Lama's stain. Such a large -scale protest is said to have not been in the history of Radakh. This phenomenon should not be ignored.
The significance of geopolitics in the Himalayas is important. In fact, China is very concerned, and China is very concerned about the pickups of the Aima. The "Belt and Road" has long studied Himalayan. I have read related books and articles. China and Nepal, China and India, China and Bhutan and so on. In these areas connected by the border, the influence of Jiawa Rinpoche is quite large. So, have you noticed this before?
What I have observed is that Sina Weibo, which was previously in China, was particularly fierce for the demonization of Jiawa Rinpoche. The click rates of various scolding various comics were hundreds of thousands or more. Ranking is third. But when it was rushing up, it suddenly cooled down, and now it has been cooling. Why is this? In Chinese social media, if the topic of politics is a hot topic, it is impossible to be a hot topic, let alone a sensitive topic related to the Dalai Lama. So I saw that Sina Weibo on April 15th began to cool down, and on April 17th, it was particularly obvious to cool down. These two times are the days when the Ladaka people are protested on a large scale. A protests in the Himalayas.
The Tibetans of Ladaka are different from Tibetans in exile Tibet. Tibetans in an exile community in India are refugees, while the Tibetans of Radak are Indians and have India identity. I also noticed that the Radak authorities have passed a decision to announce that some of the media in India's media and some big coffees. If they do not make public apology to the Garva Rinpoche, which are stigmatized, Radaks will not allow them to enter Waldling them to meet to travel and so on. Is Radak doing so is related to the influence of His Holiness in the Himalayan region over the years? We can see that at each French conference held by His Holiness, the people from Himalayan are the most, and Radakh's traditional costumes are very eye -catching. Last summer, the new crown epidemic in India relieved, and His Holiness went to Radakh and lived for more than a month, and had a good relationship with Radakh's Muslims.
 His Holiness Dalai Lama held a three -day law meeting in Lingcheng Lingcheng in Radakh in July last year. (The picture intercepts itself) Friends: I feel that there are two views of the Dalai Lama in the world: one is to look at the Dalai Lama as a person, and if a person will make mistakes. But the Dalai Lama represented not only individuals, he represents God, this is the second view. And not just a god, but also a perfect god in people's minds. Politics, culture, army, etc. can not explain or solve such a phenomenon.
The Dalai Lama is recognized by the people of the Himalayas a year than the year a year. In fact, it is not just the people in the Himalayas. I have recently attended several gatherings of Western Buddhists. There are many people. They may be suspicious when the stigma of the Dalai Lama was just occurred, but they observed and understood. After that, they thought that the Dalai Lama was not wrong, and it was innocent. In this way, the Dalai Lama really became a Buddha. After becoming a Buddha, he would not die. Even if the flesh is dead, the spirit will not die.
In fact, India has a lot of worries, and they are worried that they are afraid of the Buddhism of the Himalaya, and they are afraid of this. India has a director of a strategic research institute, Radakians, and he does not like the Buddhism of the Himalaya Tibetan biography and wrote a book. Indian political decision makers and military decision makers have this concern. If the Buddhism of the Himalaya Tibetan biography, all the Himalayas such as the border areas such as India, Darwon and other border areas, and some border areas in Nepal will become more and more Tibetan Buddhism, and the power of Buddhism may allow India to India. Feeling trouble. Therefore, some of the decision makers in India have such considerations, that is, the Himalayan region should not be tibetan Buddhism, but they did not consider the stigma of the Dalai Lama this time may bring another effect. Those media in India have no strategic considerations. They may not like the Dalai Lama, mainly because they don't like the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, but they have not taken into account what they will stimulate in the Himalayas after a distorted report. The response, they did not expect.
In fact, people in the Himalayas have not been as close to Tibetan Buddhism in the past. They did not know what religious believers they were, whether they were Hindu or Tibetan Buddhism. As the Tibetans exiled in India for longer and longer, gradually, Rinpoche has increased more temples and monks. After Cheng, there were more monks who returned from the temple from the temple to his hometown. After decades, Tibetan Buddhism has achieved results in India. Some Indian decision makers are unwilling to see it, but they have no way. Since they say that people in these areas are Indians, they should give these people the same rights as all Indians.
This time, the stigma of the Dalai Lama, Indian politics will find that the side effects of the words from the perspective of political perspective are too great. This is not only the case for the Indian government, but also the same to the Chinese government. What happened now? The Himalayan area and the Tibetan community in exile have been unified in a sense, and they believe in the Dalai Lama very much. The Dalai Lama has indeed become a Buddha.
 Tibetans living in Europe protested the stigma of the Dalai Lama. (The picture is taken from Facebook) 
Whether it is some Indian politicians, some media people, or many people in China, they really do not understand the power of faith, and they do not understand the psychology of faith. These people now make a person they should not mess with. If this person does something wrong, then his divinity will disappear. But this person did not do wrong at all, then his divinity would double. We can see: If any country, if you want to eliminate a religion, you will give him freedom and he will slowly weaken, but if you oppress religion, especially in a society like India If you do it, religion will be stronger. Today, a Western scholar and I talked about this incident and these topics. He said, "This is a gift from God to you." He believes in God, so he said that. Of course, Tibetans are very painful and believers are very painful. We saw that Tibetans and believers publicly expressed this pain. We also saw that the Dalai Lama is not human now, but God. Hand Thousand Eyes Guanyin Bodhisattva)!
Hahaha. So the biggest problem is here. Politicians consider this today and consider that one tomorrow. Today, it slipped to the side tomorrow, and the news was also a hot spot and was quickly covered by another hot spot. But Tibetans and people in the Himalayas have been talking about and will not end.
From the perspective of political science, those politicians are unwilling to treat a person as God. But now many people's minds are the Dalai Lama as a martyr, He Becomes AMartyr (he becomes a martyr)!He had nothing wrong, but he was oppressed by many forces. But they were unwilling to see someone like him as martyrs and gods. Especially those who treat him as an enemy are even more unwilling. Because the Dalai Lama becomes a martyr, it will be an eternal existence. From the perspective of political science, those people have failed and 100 % failed. Just as Jesuswas First Martyr (Jesus is the first martyr), the same is true of the Dalai Lama.
Me: You said so well!I feel like this too. That's it. Garva Rinpoche was originally the Guanyin Bodhisattva in our minds. The Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhists regard the His Holiness as the Guanyin Bodhisattva, and at other others, they think of the His Holiness as a person, and he is an old man. In this incident, some people say that the elderly dementia and the elderly are the elderly. Degenerate and so on, and so on, take it for granted. You are so right that after being stigmatized and demonized, Jiawa Rinpoche has become a martyr like Jesus. Jesus suffered, Jesus was crucified, martyrdom, this image was extremely deep and inextricable. Garva Rinpoche has become a bodhisattva that saves sentient beings in this world in the way of being hurt by the world. Now the stains of these people perfectly perfect the image of the Guanyin Bodhisattva of the His Holiness. (Serial)

 The picture shows Kiev in dawn on May 14th, the Ukrainian capital is sounding the air strike alert
(Voice of Germany Chinese) Ukraine said on Tuesday (May 16) that 18 Russian missiles were shot down one night, including six Russian hypersonic missiles "Kinzhal" (dagger hypersonic missile, Kinzhal is the Russian "dagger" "the meaning of). Moscow had previously claimed that the super weapon was unstoppable.
This is the first time Ukraine claims to shot down a row of high -speed supersonic missiles. If the news is confirmed, it will be a high -profile display of the effectiveness of the newly deployed Western air defense system.
Russian President Putin announced the dagger hypersonic missile in 2018 as one of the "new generation" weapons. He often touts the missile to show that Russia's military hardware is world -class and can confront NATO.
More reading: 
The dagger hypersonic missile can carry a conventional warhead or nuclear warhead up to 2,000 kilometers. And only admit that they are launched in a few cases.
"Unbelievable success"

According to Germany, Zaluzi said that the Ukraine air defense forces also destroyed the 6 Kamikaze Drones.
Ukraine Minister of Defense Oleksiyreznikov wrote on Twitter: "The Ukrainian Air Force has achieved another incredible success!Last night, our Sky Guardian shot down 6 Russian dagger hypersonic missiles and" 12 other missiles ... ".
Russia has not confirmed Kiev's statement, and its statement is contrary to Kiev.
Reuters reported that after the missile was blown from the air, the Kiev was shined by the flash, and the fragments were like rain. Kiev Municipal Authority said that three people were injured by fragments.
Earlier this month, Ukraine claimed for the first time, ### Moscow: "Generally, Ukraine claims that the number of missiles intercepted is three times that of our launch" 
According to the Russian News Agency, when asked about Ukraine's claim that all the hypersonic missiles launched by Russia that night, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu refuted.
Sho Gulu said that in general, the number of missiles claimed to be intercepted in Ukraine is "three times the number of launch", "and" they always make the type of missiles wrong, this is why they can't hit them. " Explanation.
Russia claims that its night attack hit all the targets, saying that its long -range precision hitting missiles is the facilities of ammunition, weapons and military equipment provided by Ukraine in the West.
"Dagger" vs. "Patriot" 
The Russian Ministry of Defense also stated that a dagger hypersonic missile destroyed the Patriot's Patriot's air -missile defense system.

Ukraine claims on Tuesday that the air defense system provided by the West has intercepted Russian missiles 100%at night.
At present, a Patriot air defense missile system provided by the United States to Ukraine may indeed be damaged. Two U.S. officials who did not want to disclose their name told Reuters that a patriotic system may be damaged in Russia's attacks, but has not been destroyed. One of the officials said that the discussion of repairing the system is in progress, and it seems that the system does not need to withdraw from Ukraine.
Ukraine denied Wednesday that Russia's supersonic missiles destroyed the Patriot missile defense system in the United States in the air raid against Kiev. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriyihnat told the Ukrainian media: "I want to say, don't worry about the fate of the patriot", he said that it is "impossible" to destroy the system with a dagger missile, saying that this is Russia's propaganda strategy Essence
The Patriot System is considered one of the most advanced air defense systems in the United States. It can be used to deal with aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, usually containing launchers, radars and other support vehicles.
Russia and Ukraine are completely contrary to each other, which also contains a contest of weapon technology. Russian dagger high supersonic missile, against the Patriot missile defense system against the West. Earlier, the ability of patriots to intercept the dagger hypersonic missile is only theoretical. If you can hit all six at a time, it will indicate that it may be a reliable defense method.

The founder of advanced chat robots ChatGPT called on US legislators to regulate the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI).
BBC reported that Samaltman, president of American artificial intelligence company OPENAI, attended the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee on Tuesday (May 16) to testify the potential and trap of ChatGPT.
In just a few months after the development of OpenAI's development of ChatGPT, several such AI models appeared in the market.
38 -year -old Ultraman said the US government should set up a new institution to issue licenses for artificial intelligence companies.
ChatGPT and other similar AI programs can create extremely human answers, but when they answer questions, they may also provide a big wrong answer.
Ultraman, who has become a spokesperson for the AI chat robot, has not avoided ethical issues caused by artificial intelligence and promotes the government for more supervision.
Ultraman said that the potential of artificial intelligence may be as huge as the printing industry technology, but he also acknowledges that artificial intelligence has potential danger.
He also admits the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy, including , Lead to layoffs in some areas.
Ultraman said: "This will impact employment opportunities. We must admit this as well as much as possible."
Ultraman also expressed concerns on the potential impact of artificial intelligence on democracy, and may be used to send targeted error information during the election period.
Companies like OPENAI should accept independent audit 
He made several suggestions on how a new institution for artificial intelligence can monitor AI chat robots, including the issuance or cancellation of artificial intelligence companies.
He also believes that companies like OpenAi should accept independent audits.
Republican Senator Holy said that the AI chat robot may be revolutionary, but this new technology is also like the invention of atomic bombs.
Democratic Senator Bulumon Sar said that the future led by AI chat robots "not necessarily the future we want".
He warned: "We need to use its benefits to the greatest extent rather than its disadvantages. Congress can now make a choice. We also face the choice when social media appeared. We have missed a chance."
Both party senators who attended the hearings on Tuesday obviously supported the establishment of a new institution to monitor the emerging industry of AI chat robots.
However, technological development is changing with each passing day, and legislators still have doubts about whether new institutions can catch up with advanced technologies.

 Czech President Peter Pavili talked to reporters at a press conference at Copenhagen Democratic Summit at Copenhagen Democratic Summit in Copenhagen, Danish on May 15, 2023. Reuters picture Czech President Petr Pavel recently said that China attempts to dominate the world is more dangerous than Russia. He explained that the principle of communication between the Czech Republic and China and Taiwan is "one China and two systems".
Czech Republic's newly elected president as a security threat to China as a security threat Czech President Paeville staged a lecture on May 15th in the 6th Copenhagen Democracy Summit in Denmark. China has no intention of establishing a peer partnership, but attempting to dominate the world. In the long run, China is far more dangerous than Russia.
Ukrainian President Zelegiski and Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen also delivered a speech. Paville alert China has claimed that Taiwan will take all means such as force and other means to unify Taiwan.
 On May 15, 2023, President Tsai Ing -wen invited by the "Alliance of Democracies (AOD) (AOD) to make a speech at the 6th" Copenhagen Democratic Summit "with a video video. (Provided by the Presidential Palace in Taiwan) Paville said that most countries respect the "One China Policy", and the Czech Republic also has its own "No. 1 China Policy." "One system" is different.
Paville emphasized that the Czech Republic is closely related to Taiwan in many fields and share the same value.
Regarding the new federation of the Czech President of Taiwan's policy "one and two systems", Ding Shufan, a honorary professor of Taiwan Politburo, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia and pointed out: "The so -called 'one China' principle," Taiwan has been part of China since ancient times' " The myth has gradually shattered. Two different political systems. "
How can the Czech president define whether the "One Middle School" can be accepted on both sides of the strait? **
Ding Shufan believes that other countries are basically "just do not say". The question is how the Czech president defines "one middle"? In the end, refer to the "Chinese" in culture, descent, and race, or "China" with national sovereignty?
Ding Shufan judged that Beijing would not agree to the saying that foreign countries and Taiwan called "one China and two systems": "Beijing is the most worried about you '一' to define it? . Why does Beijing like 'one country, two systems', because this 'is a' country ', the "People's Republic of China'."
As for whether Taiwan can accept the "one China and two systems"? Ding Shufan analyzed that the Kuomintang recognized that "Chinese" should be acceptable, and the DPP may not be able to accept the "Chinese".
Ding Shufan said: "Talking about the Chinese people have traps, and the Chinese are citizens of the People's Republic of China. This is the DPP most worried, so the DPP would rather talk about Chinese. Standing in Southeast Asia, Chinese are the concept of a ethnic group, like Singapore, like Singapore, like Singapore, like Singapore, like Singapore, like Singapore There are Chinese, Malay, Indians. "
Zhang Mengren, the convener of Foreign and International Affairs of Foreign and International Affairs of Taiwan, was interviewed and analyzed by Radio Free Asia. Pavil was a NATO retirement general and was more pro -Western. For one. Unlike Milošzeman, the former Czech President, who stepped down in March this year, belongs to his relatives. Pavili talked with Cai Yingwen as soon as he was elected president earlier this year, setting a precedent for the "prospective head of state" and Taiwan's president, and expressed his expectations to meet with Cai.
Zhang Mengren also pointed out that Pavier mentioned the "one middle and two systems", and the European Union and the United States have long been implemented. Whenever Beijing protests, the United States and the European Union will clarify that they respect the "One China Policy", but they will make up the sentence "We have our own definition of a China policy."
Zhang Mengren said: "Pavier mentioned the" two systems and two systems "at this time, which is more obvious. Under the principles of the first China, the Taiwan democratic system and the Chinese authoritarian system are clearly distinguished. Especially the recent international relations have clearly distinguished the democratic camps. And authoritarian camp. "
Zhang Mengren believes that the three countries of the Baltic Sea may also take the Czech policy as the benchmark point, and soon follow up the two systems under the so -called "No. 1 China Policy".
Zhong Zhidong, an assistant researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Defense and Security, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia. The Czech and Taiwan Speaker visited each other. The relationship was very good. The newly appointed President Parvi Military was actively faced with the threatening issue.
Scholars: The two systems of the Czech President "One Middle School" are not the same as Beijing's "one country" and two systems 
Zhong Zhidong believes that "One China" and "One Country" are different concepts: "He reflects that the international community has gradually accepted the facts of China and Taiwan. In the past, the policy of China and the principles of one China was under pressure. . One China and two systems separate Taiwan and China. In fact, the United States has gradually separated. "
Zhong Zhidong mentioned that in the past few days, the problem of the so -called 2758 resolution of the United Nations: "China uses the so -called one -China principle and compresses the international status living space of the Republic of China. It is related China's representative rights. The United States and European countries have not clearly stated their sovereignty status. They only acknowledge that there is only one China in this world. This China is called the People's Republic of China. Because in 1971, there was a competition with him from the Republic of China. "
Zhong Zhidong said that the 2758 resolution did not explain Taiwan's positioning.

Liao Daqi, a professor at the Institute of Political Science, Taiwan, was interviewed and analyzed by Radio Free Asia. The Kuomintang called to come to an end. It is amazing that the outside world predicts that Guo is not so easy to serve.
Liao Daqi said: "Guo has no suspense morale and strength in the Kuomintang camp. How do you develop in the future? Basically, it brings a lot of hope to traditional Kuomintang supporters, and brings to the middle voters and young ethnic groups. It is very fresh. This turning point, some of Guo Dong's part, quite dramatic tension, is quite motivated. Taiwan's politics has not seen this for a long time. Politicians are generally known for being selfish. How can it be put down like this now? "
Liao Daqi analyzed that if Guo Dong was determined to win for the Kuomintang, the internal contradictions, frictions, and power of power were greatly reduced. Ke Wenzhe supporters a lot of "blue power". Now that the blue power is consolidated, Ke will slowly be marginalized. Guo Taiming had about 20%of the support and was poured into the traditional supporters of the Kuomintang. Then Hou Youyi's election was strong and optimistic. Lai Qingde had to be more cautious. The room for impact that Ke Wenzhe could move was gradually narrowing and narrowing.

Shi Zhengfeng, a professor at Donghua University in Taiwan, was interviewed by Radio Free Asia. He believed that the election was still a "righteous triangle", and the three were equal.
Shi Zhengfeng said: "The Democratic Progressive Party and the Kuomintang looked down on Ke Wenzhe and believed that Ke was relatively weak. I don't think he has at least 20%or 25%of supporters. Young people who have no special political parties should have a lot of expectations for him."
Shi Zhengfeng analyzed that the Kuomintang's integration was successful. Guo Taiming may only want the seat of the vice president and the president of the Executive President to deal with it relatively well. Following Guo's legislators who came out to support the waist, he would also stabilize Zhu's integration and cooperate with Hou to win the election campaign. The problem is that after these two or three years, although the DPP has declined, the Kuomintang's support has not increased relatively.
Shi Zhengfeng said: "Hou Youyi mentioned 23 million Taiwanese to decide the future of Taiwan. It acknowledged that I was Hua Du and leaned in the middle. I don't know if the voters eat or eat?

 Former British Prime Minister Tras visited Taiwan and delivered a speech Agencence France -Presse Former British Prime Minister Tras(Liz Truss)Public speeches on visiting Taiwan emphasized that Taiwan is a lighthouse of a free society. She calls on Western society to closely cooperate closely at the security level to ensure that Taiwan has the ability to self -defense. When asked whether to consider risks to visit Taiwan, Tras said that China tried to restrict Taiwan's guests. If this behavior is condoned, it will be easier for Beijing to achieve its goals in the future.
* * **
Tellas's speech in Taiwan first mentioned that Taiwan is at the front line of freedom, and Taiwan's threat comes from a totalitarian regime 80 miles away. Chinese leader Xi Jinping issued a unified declaration to send more fighter aircraft to disturb the Taiwan. This threat will not only disappear but also increase.
"The Communist Party of China clearly stated that it is the most direct challenge to the CCP in the current form." Tellas pointed out that Taiwanese are better, free, happier, happier, and happy index than Chinese people. 37th higher than China.
"The reason I came here this week, I want to help ensure that you continue to succeed. To improve the world's understanding of Taiwan's position." Tras has a sharp development of Taiwan's economy and democracy. In addition to semiconductors, there are pearls and pearls. Milk tea marketing world, 90 % of the world's most advanced chips, 60 % of mobile phones, and computer products are from Taiwan. Around Taiwan's shipping routes are absolutely essential for global business.
Xinjiang and Hong Kong are free to be threatened and not allowed to occur in Taiwan. 
Tellas raised the scene that was freely deprived in China, including the 1989 tank entered Tiananmen Square. The "Hong Kong National Security Law" eroded the freedom of Hong Kong people and forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang. Millions were imprisoned. She urged that this situation is not allowed to occur in Taiwan. "If the freedom of Taiwan is threatened, the people of Taiwan will come forward. But you also need the allies of the entire free world to support you. I am one of the allies and you have many friends in the free world."
 Former British Prime Minister Tras visited Taiwan and delivered a speech (Reuters) [] Europe should not sit at Taiwan and suffer threats 
Tellas believes that "the biggest danger of Taiwan in the future is the theory of fate." Those theories advocate that China ’s attacking Taiwan is inevitable, and Xi Jinping is waiting for the opportunity to“ do n’t fight and bend people ”. She emphasized that people in a free and democratic country should not help and instigate such ideas. "European countries are completely irresponsible regardless of whether they are too far away or not the core part of our concern." She firmly believes that this is the core interest of the European people. Freedom and democracy, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will destroy the freedom and democracy of the Pacific Ocean.
She also mentioned that the statement of Chinese ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, publicly denied the independent existence of the Baltic nation, and found that Europe and Asia are inseparable. Tras believes that on the Ukraine issue, China should not allow China to have an influence and forced Ukraine to accept unfair solutions, which should accelerate the process of Ukraine to join NATO. She is also worried that any contract may make it difficult for the allies to defend Taiwan. "All free countries must be committed to a free Taiwan and are preparing to support it with specific measures."
Tellas advocates economic NATO to respond to China's threat 
China's economic sharp strength still has fantasies in Western society. Tellas mentioned that he was engaged in public office experience, not just Britain, but the financial departments of other countries were keen to contact China because they did not want to give up the rich profits and commercial benefits investing in China. But look at Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, bravely resist China's attempt to destroy its business.
For how to cope with such challenges, Tras put forward three suggestions, "First of all, it cannot be relying on the UN Security Council led by Russia led by Putin, nor can it rely on the World Trade Organization(WTO)To ensure that the rules of fair trade are in place, the development of ‘Economic NATO’ is required. "
A country that supports free enterprises should coordinate a mechanism. When technical exports, trade investment, and face -to -face economic coercion, they should use the best practice for China, just like the Cold War should respond to the Soviet export control and coordination committee during the Cold War period.(COCOM)Essence At present, including G7, the European Union, and South Korea, Australia, and other countries that are willing to participate, the trade agreement and economic and trade organizations can be used as the cornerstone of freedom.
She hopes that the United Kingdom and the "Cross -Pacific Partner Comprehensive Progress Agreement"(CPTPP)The main members support Taiwan to join quickly, while preventing China from joining.
Secondly, Tras advocates response to China's economic coercion and needs to work closely at the security level. Existing NATO, "Sifang Security Dialogue"(QUAD)The mechanisms need to be more coordinated, especially to ensure that Taiwan has the ability to self -defense. "In the absence of‘ hard power ’, we ca n’t pretend to be deterrent. If we really want to prevent conflicts in the South China Sea, we need to take military and defense cooperation carefully.”
She thinks this is why "Australia, Britain, and the United States' three -party security partnerships"(Sacrifice), "Global Combat Aviation Program"(Cap)Such an initiative is so important that Aukus announces a plan to provide Australian nuclear-powered submarines; G-CAP will jointly develop the next generation of fighters in Britain, Italy and Japan.
Third, Tras reminds that it must reduce dependence on China from various areas of economic and security cooperation. If Beijing upgrades to Taiwan's aggression, the deduction of substance will be inevitable. If you are not ready for this, then everyone in the free world will feel the economic pain that follows.
At the end of the speech, she particularly emphasized that this week's visit should directly convey the support of the British people to the people of Taiwan, "your future is our future."
Tellas: Can't let China restrict access to Taiwan 
 At the press conference, China criticized China to restrict visiting Taiwan, and he should get up to oppose such bullying behaviors.(Reuters) "I came to Taiwan to be invited by the Taiwan government. I believe that the election government in Taiwan knows what kind of assistance is the best for the people of Taiwan." Tellas emphasized that Beijing tries to restrict Taiwan's guests and restrict everyone to discuss Taiwan. And let the supporters say. These intimidating methods are not only in the UK, but also in Taiwan. Therefore, we must get up to oppose such bullying behaviors. Some media asked whether she would weaken Sino -British relations when she visited Taiwan, and she refuted, "Do we really want China to decide which countries can Taiwan go with the world? This is a very dangerous idea."
The media asked that she had said that the former US National Security Consultant Obelin had said that China would invade Taiwan for two years. Tellas said that Chinese President Xi Jinping had the ambition to win Taiwan, but it was not sure when and how to do it. She believes that Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China are more inclined to not use force. Of course, if necessary, force will be used if necessary. What the free world can do is to let the Chinese government understand that there will be serious consequences of attack, including the export restrictions of economic sanctions and key technologies. She said, "We will ensure that Taiwan has self -defense capabilities, and people have various speculations about the possible date. The only answer is to prepare as soon as possible to ensure that we are ready."
Tellas visited Taiwan in China jumping. 
When Tillas visited Taiwan, many Chinese departments would make high decibels, and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin criticized at a regular press conference that Tellas visited Taiwan just to use the "Taiwan issue to brush the sense of presence". The Chinese Embassy in the UK immediately issued a long statement, thinking that Tellas was provocative, and he was angry with the Taiwan independence forces, trying to provoke cross -strait opposition and confrontation, and exacerbate the tension on both sides of the strait. The PLA did not have too many major actions. According to the Taiwan Ministry of Defense, from 6 am from 6 am to 6 am on the 17th, a total of 9 aircraft were discovered.

 In February last year, Russia's invasion of Ukraine was fully invaded, which caused international condemnation. Several countries' diplomatic representatives in China raised the Ukrainian flag, or showed the image of the Ukraine flag on the poster and light boxes.
Diplomats pointed out: "We and other representative agencies received a photo of the embassies and representative offices from using the exterior walls of the building for" political propaganda "."
The diplomat said that the representative agency did not intend to do it.
Three other diplomats in Beijing confirmed that China issued this photo. Although the content did not directly mention the Ukrainian flag, it was obviously aimed at this.

 The Kuomintang officially announced on the 17th that Hou Youyi, the mayor of New Taipei, was involved in Taiwan President in 2024. The picture shows him attending a situation in November last year.
(Voice of Germany Chinese website) After a long time, the Taiwan party finally launched the presidential election candidate next year. Kuomintang Chairman Zhu Lilun announced on Wednesday (May 17) that the current mayor of New Taipei Hou Youyi on behalf of the party was elected. Zhu Lilun said that Hou Youyi, a police officer, was "the hero of the violent and safe". He believed that he could unite the Kuomintang and "jointly defend the Republic of China and protect the democracy and freedom of Taiwan. "".
Hou Youyi said that Taiwan is currently facing the "international situation in the international situation." He said: "Guarding the Republic of China, the land of the land of love to Taiwan is the only belief in my life, and never change." It is also specifically called by Taiwanese: "The Republic of China is our country, and Taiwan is our puppet. ","
Both Zhu Lilun and Hou Youyi thanked the founder of Hon Hai Group Guo Taiming, and repeatedly emphasized the importance of unity. However, before the middle of the 17th, he had congratulated Hou Youyi through Facebook, saying that he would "keep his promise" and would "do his best to support Mayor Hou's victory."
DPP legislators revealed during the Taiwan media interview that the party candidate Lai Qingde was called on Hou Youyi, reacting bland and stable. Lai Qingde also proposed a "3 -point consensus" response, and one of them called for the nominated candidates of all parties, "It is necessary to ensure that the sovereignty of Taiwan's Taiwan sovereignty is not eroded, and the free democracy constitutional system is not destroyed."
 The DPP announced in April this year that Lai Qingde, the current vice president, was nominated for the president of Taiwan.
Why is he called Hou Youyi? 
At the Kuomintang on the 17th, Zhu Lilun claimed that the decision to recruit Hou Youyi was to consider the opinions of the party's polls and the heads of counties and legislators.
According to the Kuomintang Cultural Conference announced the internal ginseng polls in May, the "mutual comparison of the party" showed that Hou Youyi's support was 40.77 %, and Guo Taiming was 31.77 %; La Lai Qingde 4.97 percentage points, while Guo Taiming lost 5.63 percentage points.
Liu Zhengshan, director of the Political Research Institute of Sun Yat -sen University in Taiwan, pointed out to DW that before Guo Taiming expressed his intention to run, Hou Youyi was already the focus of discussion in the Kuomintang, and his momentum was not sudden. As a "variable", Guo Taiming, unless the support in polls, local chiefs and the Central People's Republic of China has "strong competitive advantages", it is possible to nominate. Next, we must test how party chairman Zhu Lilun integrates; as for Guo Taiming's next step, it depends on whether he can exert its influence within the party.
Now Guo Taiming publicly expressed support for Hou Youyi. Professor Liao Daqi, Professor of Political Research of Sun Yat -sen University in Taiwan, believes that this will bring bonus effects for the Kuomintang. Liao Daqi told DW that it would not only let Stress, it is "unprecedented pressure" to the DPP.
If the outside world cares, is it possible for Guo Taiming to run with Hou Youyi as a vice presidential candidate. Liao Daqi said that from Guo Taiming's attitude, he has always judged that the possibility of "does not rule out"; Tell Dw that Guo Taiming wants "complete power", but what he can do as the vice president is limited, so he believes that the opportunity to form "Hou Guo" is not great.
 On the 17th, the Kuomintang announced the call for New Taipei Mayor Hou Youyi, and the Taiwan people's party also ran through the nomination chairman Ke Wenzhe. The picture shows Ke Wenzhe participated in the Shanghai -Taipei City Forum in China when he served as the mayor of Taipei in 2017.
Expert: Hou Youyi is "Cai Yingwen of the Kuomintang" 
Hou Youyi graduated from the Central Police School of Taiwan, starting from the grass -roots police officer; in 1989, he led his team to attack Zheng Nanrong, a Taiwanese independence person in his lunch and prisoner at the time. Since then, Hou Youyi has continued to rise step by step in the police community, with officials and police chiefs. In 2010, Zhu Lilun was elected as the mayor of New Taipei. He invited Hou Youyi to serve as the deputy mayor and also laid the foundation for Hou Youyi to twice in 2018 and 2022.
Although he has experience in the municipal political region, as a presidential candidate, Hou Youyi Testing from all walks of life. Compared with the Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lai Qingde, Hou Youyi's position in this regard is relatively vague.
At the end of April, Hou Youyi repeatedly mentioned the so -called "cup of water theory", which caused internal disputes in Taiwan. He advocated that "the Republic of China is a cup and Taiwan is water." The two are "symbiosis". What is important is to strengthen self -defense capabilities and national security and avoid "cup breaking water overwhelming."
In early May, Hou Youyi was once again asked about his cross -strait position. He said that he opposed "one country, two systems" and "adhere to Taiwan's own democratic value", but also called "Taiwan independence has no legal basis", so he opposes Taiwan independence. Hou Youyi emphasized that "everything is in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China", and at this stage, the governance of the Republic of China is in the "Taiwan Golden Horse."
 Hon Hai founder Guo Taiming congratulated Hou Youyi to the Kuomintang's call on the 17th through Facebook. (Data photo)
Experts point out that one of the key issues in Hou Youyi's discussion is that the definition of "Taiwan independence" in his mouth still needs to be clarified.
"He opposes one country, two systems, and Taiwan independence. These two will become contradictions if they are not good." Liu Zhengshan, a political scholar in Sun Yat -sen University in Taiwan, told DW that he could judge Hou Youyi on the one hand that he wanted to express it. "One country, two systems", on the one hand, because of the "Republic of China", therefore, "there is no such thing as the so -called whether to change the constitution and re -establish the country." Liu Zhengshan believes that because Hou Youyi did not say clearly, he "gave himself a misunderstanding."
Other experts pointed out that Hou Youyi said to Taiwan's positioning, followed has a difference. Professor Liao Daqi, a Professor of Rongtong, Taiwan, told DW that Hou Youyi said that he was "not much worse than Lai Qingde." He can be said to be like "Cai Yingwen in the Kuomintang", which is not so dark, but he can ask for demands from middle voters."The DPP, Hou Youyi and Ke Wenzhe's discussion on both sides of the strait seem to be increasingly reduced. I think this is also a good thing. Taiwan's consensus will become closer and closer." Fan Shiping told Dw It is the mainstream, and this set of discussion is more reflected in Guo Taiming; the next thing to observe is whether this discussion will be replaced by Hou Youyi in the party, or through Guo Taiming and Ke Wenzhe Choose yourself to promote your position.

Xia Liyan visited mainland China during the sensitive period 
Shortly after the military exercise of the PLA surrounding Taiwan last year, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, ignored the absence of the Taiwan party and led a delegation to visit mainland China. The Kuomintang's press release mentioned that Xia Liyan and Zhang Zhijun communicated with issues such as Chinese military exercises, agricultural product inspection and quarantine issues, ECFA earlier lists, cross -strait increases (resumed small three links), and Taiwanese businessmen's rights and investment guarantee. Xia Liyan claimed that the Chinese people had reflected to the Chinese people who were dissatisfied and worried about the Chinese military in the surrounding waters of Taiwan. Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen stated at the Democratic Progressive Party that at this moment, the Kuomintang still insisted on going to China to disappoint the people; the Kuomintang's approach also passed the wrong information to the international community.

Wang Jinping's "Seeking peace" in CCTV show 
In September 2020, the Kuomintang originally intended to send former Legislative Dean Wang Jinping as the head of the delegation to attend the 12th "Straits Forum" held in Xiamen. However, due to the days before the forum, when CCTV, CCTV reported on the "central video" of social media, reported that Wang Jinping will play the title of "Taiwan Strait's fierce war, this person comes to summon" on behalf of the Kuomintang forum on behalf of the Kuomintang forum. The opposition and the opposition are dissatisfied. The Kuomintang announced the cancellation of participation in the Strait Forum in the form of a party, and also stated that in such an atmosphere, the Kuomintang's return group may cause the cross -strait public opinion.

The attitude of the Chinese government to Hou Youyi 
In response to Hou Youyi recently called "opposing Taiwan independence and opposition to one country, two systems", a spokesman for the China State Council, Ma Xiaoguang, responded on the morning of the 17th: "The system is not a unified obstacle, nor is it an excuse for division." Based on the "1992 Consensus" and anti -"Taiwan independence", they "jointly promote the peaceful development of cross -strait relations."
In this regard, expert Liao Daqi said that the Chinese government originally echoed consistent with the statement of Taiwanese politicians, but they need to reiterate their position. "Fan Shiping believes that this" to some extent refutes Hou Youyi's view to some extent "What China is even more hopes that people like Guo Taiming intend to launch a unified political negotiation with China, but Hou Youyi's statement may mean that he will refuse to develop in this direction.

 The Political Propaganda of the "Notice of May 1st" made by the Beijing Red Council Central Academy of Fine Arts "Gemina Red Flag" in 1967. Screenshots of the network Hello everyone, welcome everyone to listen to "History of the Great", I am the host Sun Cheng. Today, we will continue to carry out historical stories related to the Cultural Revolution history, telling historical stories related to the symbol of the Cultural Revolution.
Just when I wrote the draft of this lecture, my western time in the United States was on May 16, 2023. On May 16, 1966, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China launched the May 16th Notice, marking the official start of the Cultural Revolution. On such a day to tell you the "May 16th Notice", it can be said that it is quite a coincidence. A friend of mine is today, saying to me, "It's a year after a year, and it has been 57 years since the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution." Another friend said to me, "Fifty It has been seven years. "It can be seen that in the minds of many people, the memory of the history of the Cultural Revolution has not disappeared. And in such a scene of the decision and death of millions of people 57 years ago, it can be said that it is really very meaningful.
Then, let's continue that history.
In the previous lecture, we talked about the main content of the May 16th Notice, and clicked this document that marked the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution. It looks like the criticism of Peng Zhen's "February Outline". These criticisms were attacked by Peng Zhen with a very high tuning door, setting all the guilt represented by this outline to Peng Zhen's head, and buckled the "Main Main mistakes of the February Outline". ", Think that this outline" stands on the position of the bourgeoisie "," violates all class struggles is the basic argument of political struggle, "and said it distorted Mao Zedong's speech. The May 16th Notice also believes that the "February Outline" attempts to limit the criticism of Wu Yan to the academic scope. The bourgeoisie's academic "is not qualified to compete with the" proletarian academic "equal competition at all, and only the" overwhelming and elimination ". The May 16th Notice has also raised the criticism of the February Outline to a height that is unsuccessful. "And" future appearance ", even" a top priority to the world revolution. " In other words, the "May 16th Notice" raised the route represented by the "February Outline" to a height of "saving the earth".
So, what do you need to do to the kind of struggle mentioned in the May 16th Notice? In fact, the last few paragraphs of this notice can be said to be the core, and it is repeatedly cited repeatedly by various cultural revolutionary history works. Now, let's listen to these contents.
2. Movement of large -scale political cleaning: the intention of the "May 16th Notice" 
The first half of the third natural paragraph of the "May 16th Notice" requires the party committees of the Communist Party of China to immediately stop the implementation of the February Outline and say:
"The whole party must follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, hold high the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, and completely expose the bourgeois reactionary position of the so -called 'academic authority' of the anti -party and anti -socialism, and completely criticize the academic, educational, and press. , The bourgeoisie of the literary and artistic circles, the publishing industry, the reactionary thinking of the bourgeoisie, and seize the leadership in these cultural fields. "
Judging from these contents, this notice seems to be placing the goal in the academic, educational, pressing, literary and art circles, and publishing circles. "The proletarian cultural revolution." In other words, it seems that this political movement seems to be limited to cultural and intellectuals. But next, the second half of the third natural paragraph of "May 1st notice" turned around and said, saying:
"To do this, we must also criticize the bourgeois representatives in the party, the government, the army, and the cultural fields at the same time. To clean these people, some need to mobilize their positions. In particular, these people cannot be credited to these people To do the leadership cultural revolution, and there are indeed many people doing this kind of work in the past and now, which is extremely dangerous. "
It can be seen from this paragraph that the "proletarian cultural revolution" that Mao Zedong's upcoming "proletarian cultural revolution" is by no means just the people in the cultural world, but at the same time in the CCP, the government, and the army at the same time. Expand cleaning with the cultural world. This paragraph also states that it is not allowed to make these so -called "bourgeois representatives" that will be cleaned and mobilized as "the work of leadership cultural revolution" because "this is extremely dangerous." It can be said that although this political movement is called a "cultural revolution", its substance is far beyond the cultural cleaning, which is a large -scale political cleaning. Moreover, judging from the phrase "the work of not being able to do these people to do leadership cultural revolution", the target of being cleaned also includes people at high.
The second natural paragraph of the "May 16th Notice" is more intense. This content is like this:
"The bourgeois representatives of the mixed party, the government, the army, and the various cultural circles are a group of counter -revolutionary correctionists. Once the time is mature, they will seize the regime. Dictatorship. Some of these characters have been seen by us, while others have not been recognized. Some are being credible and cultivated as our successors, such as characters like Khrushchev. They are sleeping in our body. Beside, party committees at all levels must pay full attention to this. "
This content indicates that those who are about to be cleaned or mobilized are "bourgeois representatives" and "counter -revolutionary correctionists" of the so -called "mixed" of the Communist Party of China and the cultural circles. When the time is mature, it will seize the CCP's regime and engage in the so -called "bourgeois dictatorship". Moreover, some of these people not only "have not been seen yet", but also received credit and were trained into "successors". It can be said that this content depicts a group of people trying to seize the CCP's regime from the party, government and military and cultural circles, and some of them are still in a "latent state". In the words "May 16th", these people are what the CCP calls "Khrushchev who sleeps next to us."
 On September 15, 1966, Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Lin Biao carried out the "Seeing Red Guards" on the Tiananmen Tower. (Wikipedia) Even more "explosive" is the description of "Khrushchev who sleeps around us" in the notice. Khrushchev was the Soviet leader who became the leader after the Stalin's death after his death. His well -known actions in history made a secret report that criticized Stalin in the 20th National Congress of the CPSU in 1956, and severely criticized Stalin's personal dictatorship and personal worship. After that, the CPSU and the Communist Party of China broke step by step, and Khrushchev was defined as a traitor in the official ideology of the CCP, thinking that he had betrayed Marxism -Leninism and Stalin's political route. Regarding these grievances of the Republic of the Soviet Union, we will tell in detail in the subsequent content. Here we just need to understand that in the political context of the Chinese Communist Party in 1966, "Khrushchev" was actually a synonym for "traitor", and "Khrushchev, who sleeps around us" Big vernacular means "traitors who lurk around us."
It is worth noting that before Stalin's death, Khrushchev was at a high position in the Central Committee of the CPSU and became a celebrity around Stalin. After Stalin's death, he denied Stalin. This resume of Khrushchev is actually easily reminiscent of Liu Shaoqi. In the May 16th Notice, the saying "successor" as "Khrushchev who sleeps next to us" is easy to make people think that if Mao Zedong died, would Liu Shaoqi also Like Khrushchev's negation of Stalin, he denied Mao Zedong's political route and personal worship.
It can be said that in the "May 16th Notice" of Peng Zhen and the "February Outline" directly on the bright side, Mao Zedong showed his greater political cleaning plan. There will be a group of people being cleaned in the cultural world, and it also implies that someone is lurking like Khrushchev, ready to deny Mao Zedong's political route and deny the so -called "proletarian dictatorship". The "successor" is used to describe these "Khrushchev", which implies that the goal of this political cleaning will include Liu Shaoqi.
3. CCP leadership collectively press the start button of the Cultural Revolution 
Although there have been so many hints in this notice, Liu Shaoqi, who is responsible for the daily work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, can only be presided over the expansion of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in May 1966 in accordance with the internal procedures of the Communist Party of China. The May 16th Notice. According to Yu Ruxin, a historian of the Cultural Revolution, the record of Qi Benyu, the backbone of Mao faction, Qi Benyu once recalled the process of passing the "May 16th Notice" at the meeting. Qi Benyu, who had attended the meeting, recalled: "Liu Shaoqi, who presided over the meeting, invited members of the Politburo to vote for the meeting and did not objection. After that, Liu Shaoqi told the attendees sitting in the back row. In this way, the attendees also raised their hands, and those who attended and attended the meeting were "consistently passed ', but the latter should not be included in the number of votes."
It should be pointed out that there were 76 people who participated in the expansion meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, including members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the time, as well as the heads of some departments, as well as Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao, and Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,,,, Zhang Chunqiao, Zhang Chunqiao,,,, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Qi Benyu and other hardcore Mao factions, including the "Central Drafting Group". It can be said that these participants include the factions within the Communist Party of China at that time. In the case of Mao Zedong's absence, they voted for the "May 16th Notice" together with Liu Shaoqi's host, and pressed the start button of the Cultural Revolution together. From this point, it can be said that each of these people is the same as Mao Zedong, and they are carrying blood debts to the people who died in the Cultural Revolution.
So, it is worth asking for the approaching of Mao Zedong's step -by -step approach, Liu Shaoqi is really so "honest" and so on the ears? He presided over the meeting through May 16th, would he really capture like this? At this time, Mao Zedong, who is not in Beijing, what kind of political plans do you have inside, how to further advance to his political goals step by step, and how to launch a large -scale political cleaning? In fact, of course, Liu Shaoqi will not be so soft, and Mao Zedong also has more backhand. The "fighting method" between the two of them will soon ignite the fire of the violent Cultural Revolution and involve countless livelihood into the violent flow of political movements.
Thank you everyone, this week, we will see you next week.

 Vladivostak is the largest port city of Russia on the Pacific coast.
(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The official website of the China Customs Department issued an announcement on May 4, saying that "the strategic deployment of the country's rejuvenation of the northeast old industrial base and the promotion of the use of overseas ports to carry out cross -border transportation cooperation in domestic trade, the General Administration of Customs Agency, the General Administration of Customs Agency Decided to further expand the scope of cross -border transportation business of domestic trade goods in Jilin Province "," agreed to increase Russia's cross -border transportation of Russia on the basis of the scope of cross -border transportation business in the original Jilin Province's domestic trade goods The transit port has increased the two ports of Zhoushan Yushan, Zhejiang Province, and two ports of Jiapu Port in Jiaxing.
Public information shows that "cross -border transportation of domestic trade" refers to the business that domestic trade goods are launched from ports in China and through overseas operations to another port in China.
In the announcement of the General Administration of Customs, the content of "Russia's Vladivostak Port has become a cross -border transportation port of domestic trade" has attracted public opinion. Some public account issued a post and asked "Russia's Vladivostok Port to become Northeast China '‘ out of the sea ”?
Once the Chinese Land 
The Russian Vladivostak, formerly known as Vladivostok, was Chinese territory in the Qing Dynasty and the previous Yuan and Ming dynasties. In the 1860 "China -Russia Beijing Treaty", the Qing Dynasty ceded the Russian Empire to the east of the Ussuri River, including Vladivostok. Essence
Today, Vladivostak is the largest port city along the Pacific Russia and is a near -sea transportation center in the Far East of Russia. It is also the largest city and economic and cultural center in Russia in the Far East, and it is also located at the headquarters of the Russian Pacific Fleet.

Land transportation from Jilin greatly shortened the estuary of the Haikou ** 
Said, "Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces have not been out of sea. They have long been transferred from Dalian Port, Liaoning for a long time. After obtaining the estuary of the Russian Far East Port, the land transport distance will be greatly shortened." And Suifenhe and Hunchun to Vladivostok, Russia only about 200 kilometers, the cost of land transportation can be greatly reduced. "
"Caixin" reported that since 2022, China -Russia trade has increased sharply, and the transportation capacity of container ships from the port from the southeast coast to the port of Vladivostok, and the capacity of ship return has increased. "At this time, in September 2022, the Jilin Yichun City Airlines Bureau applied to increase the transit port of Vladivostok as a cross -border transportation transit port of domestic trade goods, and increased Zhejiang's two ports for cross -border transportation ports for domestic trade goods."
The report quoted a senior cargo generation in Shanghai that the goods of Jilin and Heilongjiang used the overseas port to transport the south, "not only reduced the cost, but also conducive to the closeness of China's industrial chain and supply chain between neighbors." The contradiction is that China's major ports transporting goods to Russia have been congested due to rapid rising goods. Although it is close to the distance, it is not easy to transport the goods to Vladivostok. "

Russia agrees to provide Vladwarstok (Vladivostok) to China to transfer, which means that after 163, the Chinese have re -owned the Chinese people re -owned the re -ownership of the Chinese people.

 (Voice of Germany Chinese website) "New Zurich" commented that May 4th is the Youth Day of China, but this year's "May 4th" does not seem to have made young people happy to have a holiday. It has exceeded 20%, which is the highest record since relevant statistics. This article entitled "Xi Jinping's call to the countryside to wake up the pain of pain in the countryside" and wrote:
"Chinese young people use‘ we are the last generation ’on social media, which is reminiscent of the hopeless atmosphere of Western young people in the early 1980s. Protestion. There is no doubt, Essence This situation is likely to evolve into social explosives that threaten the CCP's rule. The younger generation has shown the courage to express dissatisfaction with the system: Essence This time, it is publicly criticized by college students. In China, about 80 college students participated in the protests. Their actions did put pressure on the authorities. Two months later, Xi Jinping announced the cancellation of epidemic prevention measures.
 In November last year, young Chinese people walked on the streets of the mountains to protest the "clearing policy" of the authorities.
If the crisis faced by the younger generation further intensifies, normalized, or a emergencies set off a larger -scale protests among young people, what will happen? The Beijing authorities are very clear that the younger generation hides special risks that affect social stability. In view of this, school education does not allow free thinking and questioning, but to cultivate a younger generation who obeyed command and death. Now, in order to better control the younger generation, Xi Jinping obviously wants to take further measures: he wants to send young people to the countryside.
Xi Jinping has previously emphasized the suggestions for young people to go to the countryside. However, this proposal appeared on May 4 this year's "People's Daily" on the top version of the important position, which has never been before. Xi Jinping issued a warning that young people should take responsibility and prepare for a hard life. Young people should go to the countryside to find a job to revitalize the local economy. Those young people who leave the city and help poverty alleviation in remote and backward areas are worthy of praise. Xi Jinping left Beijing at the age of 16 and began his life in the mountains. Xi Jinping said: 'Seven -year rural life is a good exercise for me. '"
The comments pointed out that at the end of 2019, the China Youth League organization had proposed a plan to allow 10 million college students to go to the countryside to find employment, and Guangdong and Shandong also made relevant suggestions.
"In China, the rural life is not much related to the rural poetry, which means that the prospects are dim. But in order to ensure social stability, the Communist Party still wants to exile the younger generation of the future and educated younger generation of the country to the countryside.
This measure worked in the Mao Zedong era, and it also worked in the Xi Jinping era: dispersing young students to remote mountain villages across the country, and they will not be able to protest. Although they have been used to a large degree of personal freedom in the past three decades, such as freedom of travel. However, the long -term clearance policy shows that when facing crisis, the government can completely force the number of people to give up personal freedom. However, the Communist Party will also pay heavy economic and social costs for its continuous overweight suppression policies. The younger generation's sense of distrust of the government will also be increasing day by day. "
While the government calls on young people to enter the countryside, there are indeed many unbearable urban young people who take the initiative to go to remote areas. "Editorial Network" wrote here:
"The new sacred place for the countryside is the northernmost tip of China's remote mining city: Hegang. This small town near Russia is known as the lowest cost of living in China '. In the past few months, hundreds of each day Young people come to this city. Because even if there is not much savings, they can realize the real estate dream here: less than 80,000 yuan can buy a small apartment, and the heating fee is borne by the municipal government.
However, the cost of low living costs actually requires a high price: the temperature in the winter of Hegang can be as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the recent hospital also takes a few hours of drive. "

 EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell
(Voice of Germany) on During the interview, Joseporrell, the head of the European Union's foreign policy, said that the EU should find ways to reduce Moscow's revenue from refined fuel, saying that the European Union should crack down on India's behavior of transferring Russia's oil processing to Europe.
Brell said, Brussels knows , Then process it into fuel and sell it to Europe. The Financial Times reported that this is the first time Boriel stated that the European Union should take action to prevent this behavior.
Reuters pointed out in its relevant reports that after Moscow invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, India has become a big buyer of Russian oil in the past year. The cheap Russian crude oil has increased the output, profits and competitiveness of Indian refineries, allowing it to export refined oil to Europe and occupy more market share.
"This must be a avoidance of sanctions" 
Borel told the Financial Times that he would mention the matter with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyamjaishankar at a meeting on Tuesday. He said that if diesel or gasoline from India and enters Europe is produced with Russian oil, "this must be a avoidance of sanctions."
The head of the European Union's foreign policy also said: "India buys Russia's oil, which is normal ... but if they use this, they will become a Russian oil processing center and sell the products to us .... .. We must take action. "
 Indian Foreign Minister Su Jesheng said that his understanding of the EU sanctions rules is that Russian crude oil that has been processed in the third country is no longer considered to be Russian products (data pictures)
At a press conference after Boriel and Indian Foreign Minister Su Jiesheng after Tuesday, Su Jiesheng said that his understanding of the EU sanctions rules is that Russian crude oil, which has been substantially transformed in the third country, is no longer considered to be Russian products.
EU Council Vice Chairman Margrethe Vestager said that the European Union will discuss with India on this issue, but it will be accusing the tone with a cooperative attitude.
"We must see who is buying" 
Reuters reports that India's refineries have rarely purchased Russian oil due to high transportation costs. However, from April 2022 to March 2023, India imported an average of 970,000-98 million barrels of Russian oil per day, accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's overall fuel import.
Russia's largest petroleum producer Rosneft and Indian refining giant Indian Oilcorp also signed an agreement to greatly increase the oil grade delivered to India to diversify it.
India's appetite for Russian oil is getting bigger and bigger 
According to the ship tracking data from the French commodity tracking company KPLER, the Reliance Industries and Nayaranergy are the main exporters of refined fuel and Russian oil buyer. These companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' inquiries.
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, India usually exported 154,000 barrels of diesel and aviation fuel to Europe average daily. Data from KPLER show that since the EU has banned Russian oil products from importing from February 5 this year, this number has increased to an average of 200,000 barrels per day.
Brell told the Financial Times that any mechanism that restricts Russian oil flow needs to be implemented by authorities of various countries, suggesting that the EU can target Indian refined fuel buyers. He said, "If they are selling, it is because someone is buying. We must see who is buying."

 A technology personnel is conducting genetic research Associated Press Picture
Tags: false **
One -minute reading: Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin recently said that the Wall Street Journal has disclosed that the US Pentagon has formulated a research and development plan to combat opponents with genes. The genes of the Middle East Arabs are included in the scope of the US military collection.
Asian factual investigation of the laboratory found that there was no evidence that the Wall Street Journal had released such reports. The Chinese network records show that the rumors of the US military's research and development of race -based genetic weapons have been circulating for more than 20 years in the simplified Chinese world. Earlier sources have been publicized by the Russian world since the Soviet era. In response to this allegations, the US State Department responded to the Asian factual investigation laboratory that China had no basis for accusations. Scientific and technological reports and recent statements of the US Department of Defense have also showed that the current technical level of human beings cannot achieve "murder according to specific genes."
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin (pictured from the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China)
Deep analysis: 
On May 10, 2023, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China : "The United States is a country that is widely collected and used in genetic information. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Pentagon of the United States has formulated a research and development plan to combat opponents with gene weapons. Genes are included in the scope of the US military collection. "
On the same day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Essence
Asian facts check the laboratory found that Wang Wenbin's statement has no basis and obviously violates the operating logic of international affairs.
1. "Gene weapon" accusation lacks basis 
The search page of the Asian Fact Inspection Labs on the English website of the Wall Street Journal uses the combination of keywords such as "Genetical Engineered Weapon" and "Pentagon". No relevant reports are found.
Search by the same keywords such as Google, Bingbi, and other search engines cannot find related content.
Asian facts checking the laboratory sent an email to the Wall Street Journal, but did not receive a reply before the deadline.
On Monday, the U.S. State Department said that the Laboratory of the Asian Factation Inspection said that China ’s accusations were not foundable and it was completely wrong.
The State Council said in the reply:
"American genetic research uses genome information to improve human health, not to attack human health, and related research is carried out under the premise of protecting personal rights and privacy;
We cherish the benefits of biotechnology to all human beings, and continue to lead and formulate the norms and rules of advanced biotechnology with partners and allies. These norms and rules meet our values and protect human rights principles;
However, other countries, including the People's Republic of China, are abusing these technologies. "
** 2. On the Chinese network, the US military has collected Chinese genes to make biological weapons for at least 20 years, but it is still a "plan".
Asian facts checking the laboratory on the Chinese network with the "Wall Street Journal", "Pentagon Building", "Asian Chinese, European Arajans, Middle East Arabia" search shows that the US military has collected Chinese genes to create weapons. The less from the official media, such as the article released by the China National Defense News in January 2014 [] To.
The earliest report can be back to Essence The reporter Chen Weimin interviewed a activist named Tong Zeng. The work "The Last Line" declared that the United States and the United Kingdom have been stealing Chinese genes, and the Agascus is likely to be a genetic weapon for China for Western countries. In the interview of the China Youth Daily, there is such a paragraph: "In order to ensure the future dominance of the United States, the U.S. military has formulated a plan to use gene weapons as a secret weapon to combat enemies. Chinese Chinese, European in Europe, and the genes of the Arabs in the Middle East are all collected by the U.S. military. "
Like the "China National Defense Daily" article, the articles of Chinese official media mentioned the Wall Street Journal, but none of them provided the date, title, direct quotation and original links of the report. The interviewees have no specific information such as names, occupations, and only vague claims of "participants".
Asian facts investigation of the laboratory recently believed in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and asked the news about the news and the specific information reported by the Wall Street Journal, but did not receive a reply as of press time.
In fact, in addition to SARS, the rumors of "gene war" and "gene weapons" repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly been repeated in network space during the new crown epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War. According to them, the "plan" of developing gene weapons in the United States has begun 20 years ago, but to this day, it is still only known as the "plan", and the Wall Street Journal has not made any follow -up reports.
3, "gene weapon" and "biological warfare", are the themes of Soviet and Russian information war growth. 
Historical data recorded by the official website of the US State Department showed that since the former Soviet era, , AIDS, anthrax, Ebola, SARS, and new crown virus have all been called biological weapons made by the United States or Western by the Soviet Union and Russia. The "SARS may be a genetic weapon for China" claimed by Tong Zeng's works, similar to Russia's propaganda caliber.
 Screenshot of the webpage of the School of Public Policy of the University of Maryland The report did not show that FSB mentioned information such as Chinese and Middle Eastern people. However, after translating it into Chinese, the communicator joined information such as "Pentagon", "Asian Chinese, European Yalian, and the Middle East Arabia" and other information. The mouth was announced to the world.
4. The weapons of murderers of specific genes cannot be achieved at the current technical level 
British released in 2021 NO TIME to DIE Among them, a gene weapon engineering called the "Projectheracls" is fictional. The nano robot developed by the project to discharge the virus according to a specific DNA encoding. Others with a specific DNA are not affected. This bridge section of "killing by genes" is common in literary works. In April 2022, a popular science website of Cambridge University It is clearly explained that the weapons that are murdered by specific genes cannot be achieved at the current technical level.
5. The United Nations Convention on Biological Weapons has strictly restricted biological weapons 
However, the development of science and technology is thousands of miles a day. If there is no restriction on the use of technology, it is likely to cause out of control. Biotechnology is like nuclear weapons technology. The choice faces is not "can", but "should".
Biological weapons convention, BWC It has made comprehensive restrictions on the development, production, acquisition, transfer, storage, and use of biological weapons in the world, and has established specifications for the peaceful use of biotechnology. At present, there are 183 signing of the convention, and the United States and China are both parties.
In the spring of 2022, when the false information of "the United States established a biological laboratory in Ukraine" flooded the network space, And reiterated again that the United States, as one of the Contractors of the Biological Weapon Convention, has been strictly abide by the Convention.

Therefore, if they want to establish an energy supply chain with Central Asian countries, in order to cope with the war in the Taiwan Strait, the current route of imported from the Malacca Strait may be due to Western sanctions. And restricted.

According to Hong Kong 01, Dai Bing commented on the upcoming China-Central Asian Summit on Tuesday on Tuesday. —Exposed by the Central Asian Destiny Community. "Dai Bing added that at the summit, China and Central Asia will emphasize mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, jointly crack down terrorism, and jointly deepen cooperation in the" Belt and Road ".
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also mentioned on May 8th that the China-Central Asian Summit "is the first major home diplomatic activity in China this year, and it is also the first time that the sixth countries have held the summit for the first time in the first 31 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations."
Zack Cooper, a senior researcher at the Washington Think Tank American Institute (AEI), told reporters in an interview with this station that in the China-Central Asian Summit, Central Asian countries should pay attention to the "Belt and Road" issue: "Central Asian countries I hope to maintain China's investment in Central Asia. China ’s“ Belt and Road ”funds have declined in recent years, so Central Asian countries will ask Beijing to provide more funds and resources. At the same time, members of the meeting will focus on Russia and the members of the meeting. China's power interaction in Central Asia. "
The Broadcasting Corporation reported on the 17th that the stage that Xi Jinping chose was not Beijing, but Xi'an. Xi'an used to be the starting point of the Silk Road. This main road connecting China and Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe is also an important channel for China's economic and diplomatic expansion.
Ten years ago, Xi Jinping, who came to power shortly, proposed the "Belt and Road" plan that revived the ancient Silk Road in Kazakhstan, Central Asian countries.
 On May 16, 2023, the countdown clock showed that the Seventh Kingdom Group Summit will open in Hiroshima, Japan after three days. (Agencelet) [] Scholars: The Qi Kingdom Group Summit will focus on China's harm to global economic security 
At the same time, the Seventh Kingdom Group Summit is about to be held in Hiroshima, Japan on Friday. The outside world estimates that the summit will focus on the issues of China. According to international media reports, this summit will release 6 results documents. The above documents will not only require China to bear the "responsibility of being a member of the international community", but also reiterate the importance of peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait. In addition, the above documents will also mention Ukraine issues, nuclear disarmament, and how to face China's economic stress and improve economic security.
In response to the Summit of the Seventh National Group, Cooper analyzed the Seven Kingdoms Group will focus on exploring China's economic coercion issues and issued a statement. The main information will be to maintain the existing order, so China will be mentioned at the meeting, but I think that there will be more parts of Russia, especially for the Russian and Ukraine War. As for the part of China, the summit should discuss how to deal with China's unfairness. Economic operations and economic coercion, although it may not be named China in the statement. "
Bonnieglaser, Director of the Indian Project of the Marshall Foundation (GMF) in Washington, USA, also said in an interview with this station that members of the Seven Groups are highly concerned about the economic threat of China: " A separate statement will be issued for economic security issues. Although China is likely to not be named, the discussion at the summit and the content of the post -after -to -event statement will show their concerns about China. And discuss specific measures. They will also discuss the issue of overseas investment review. "
Scholars: China-Central Asia Summit is intended to compete with the Seventh-way Group Summit to compete 
For the China-Central Asian Summit and the Seventh Kingdom Group Summit chose to be held at a similar time, June Teufeldreyer, a professor at the Department of Political Department of the University of Miami, told the reporter that this is China ’s intention to compete with the Seventh National Group:" China chose to hold this time to hold it at this time. The China-Central Asian Summit is intended to compete the public's attention to the Seventh Kingdoms Group Summit. China has generally abandoned the impact of the developed countries, that is, a member of the Seventh Kingdoms Group. China will focus more on improving the support of China to China. Including Central Asian countries. "
In this regard, Cooper also has a similar view: "I am not sure that the time for the China-Central Asian Summit is to be finalized before or after the Seventh National Group Summit, but it is worth noting that China often holds diplomatic activities in large diplomatic activities in the United States in the United States. So I would not be surprised if China specially chose to hold a summit at this time, which is likely to be China intentionally to confront the Seventh Kingdom Group. "

The company's party building is not in place, indicating that there is not enough political awareness. In China, political awareness is very important."
Some netizens said: "The People's Liberation Army is too glassy, and people have not named them. They have to put themselves up. So they are afraid of insults, and fight? People have defeated the PLA." Some netizens pointed out: "Now The atmosphere is very confusing, I was reported when I was everywhere, and I insulted it when I was everywhere ... Is everyone who takes a red book ??? Is it a period of the Cultural Revolution? Is it me trapped? "
Who did this talk show "offens"? 
What exactly is China's official red line in this incident? Why is the official media emphasizing that "listening to the party's command, being able to win the battle, and excellent style", each word is "not allowed to offend"?
In fact, this slogan comes from Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In 2013, Xi Jinping said at the PLA delegation at the First Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress: "The building of a people's army that listened to the party, can win the battle, and excellent style is the party's goal in the new situation. "Official media often quoted this passage to describe the Chinese army.
Henghe, a scorching commentator in the United States, told the station that the official movement was to work hard because this talk show actually offended Xi Jinping. "Because now the personal worship of Xi Jinping has reached the point of reaching the peak. For example, in that museum, the tea cup he stared at. Then what he said and the definition of the CCP army, can you use it casually? The most important thing is that he uses this to use this words, and of course it is not allowed. "
Henghe said that the official believes that this talk show is a "disrespect" to Xi Jinping, but it cannot be said directly, so it has to be used as "insulting the PLA". In fact, the CCP has never really respected the soldiers. "Those soldiers who killed Laoshan had no money to go there for decades to sweep the grave for decades. Who cares? There is no such thing. "
Yao Cheng, former Chinese Navy Lieutenant Colonel, also told this station that the CCP severely punished the talk show actor and company, but appeared on the surface to maintain the army's posture and maintain its rule. "The Communist Party now rely on the gun to protect its rule and its own interests. The army is its lifeblood, and it must fall down when it loses the army. Therefore, it must maintain the so -called 'reputation' of the soldiers. ah?"
For example, Yao Cheng said that in the confrontation between the Sino -Indian border, the army of the two sides used stones to fight, and more than 20 people died in India. The official held a national burial, while the Chinese side died more than 40 people, but the authorities secretly buried them. The family members were not allowed look. "How much honor does Chinese soldiers have? To be honest, even dogs are not as good as dogs."
Yao Cheng believes that after the June 4th massacre of 1989, soldiers have fallen extremely high in the minds of Chinese people. Now, soldiers have no sense of honor for their identity. "The current army is no longer the soldiers of the country and the people. It is a member of the SS, and even Xi Jinping's personal watch dog. So this talk show is not accidental."In addition to laughing fruit culture and actor Li Haoshi, the case also caused a chain effect. According to the Chinese Digital Age, on May 16, a Weibo netizen@hwy commented on the topic of the "Xiao Guo talk show performance storm", thinking that it should not be permanently blocked by the artist, and at the same time, a ridicule should be released at the same time. Comment, "Isn't the soldier brother who is a dog brother?" However, this comment was reported by other Weibo users. The netizen was subsequently detained by Dalian Public Security because of "publishing improper remarks involving soldiers on the Internet."
In February of this year, the Chinese talk show actor Chi was touched in North America. The suspected performance of the performance involved the sensitive topic of the authorities and was blocked on the domestic network. In November last year, the Weibo account of the talk show actor Meng Chuan was also banned. The online screenshot of the circulated showed that he protested by the "white paper movement" and praised the students.
These stalks are all expressed exaggeratedly to find the laughter and weakness of society, so the talk show is the easiest to be "taboo".
At present, the control of the Chinese authorities for public opinion is considered the strictest period after the Cultural Revolution. Henghe said that in recent years, the CCP has returned to the Mao Zedong era more and more, and the literary and art circles have returned to the program of "Yan'an Literature and Art Symposium". "Because Xi Jinping missed that era, it was impossible to reproduce the Cultural Revolution, but the control before the Cultural Revolution was his ideal state of Chinese society."
"Things are changing ... " 
May 16 this year is the 57th anniversary of the Cultural Revolution. Regarding this talk show, Yu Maochun, director of the China Center of the Hudson Institute in the United States, issued a meaningful tweet on the evening of the 16th: "things are changing ..."
Henghe said that the rectification talk show is to kill a hundred hundred, indicating that whether it is in the officialdom or in the entertainment industry, "Xi Jinping's authority is absolutely impossible to challenge."

 When the Presidential Office announced the dissolution of the parliament, it stated that La Suo "disbanded the National Assembly in view of a severe political crisis and national turbulence."
The day before, La Suo proposed a defense against his impeachment case. He denied the allegations of corruption and said that his government was amended the contract signed a few years before he took office for the benefit of the country.
Although the Congress Supervisory Committee listened to the testimony of the opposition members, officials and lawyers of La Shun, he stated that impeachment was not recommended in the report. Most members still supported a resolution, accusing La shuttle for allowing corruption contracts to continue.
La Su said in a film: "This is a democratic decision, not only because it meets the Constitution, it also gives power to the people of Ecuador ... decide their future in the next election."
In the same film, La Shu also ordered tax reform, saying that this would reduce the tax burden of Ecuador.
Ecuador's Constitution is loaded in a principle that allows La Shun to request the presidential and Congress elections under certain circumstances. These conditions include when the legislature hinders the government's operation.
The election court must decide to hold the election date within 7 days of the Congress.
Some members said that any dissolution of Congress operations are unconstitutional and they will refuse to follow.

After overnight, Tesla held an annual shareholders' meeting. At the conference, Tesla's various matters for the company, including: board members and shareholders 'voting, long -term planning of various measures, and Tesla's former executives' return to members of the board of directors.

In fact, the date of this year's annual shareholders' meeting was several months earlier than last year. From various news platforms and social platforms, some investors are unhappy about this. They believe that Tesla did not give them enough time to make some matters that need to allow shareholders to vote at the conference.

The first is the members of the board of directors. Tesla's co -founder and former chief technology officer JBSTRAUBEL returned to the nest, and he was also selected as a new member of the Tesla board.

CEO Musk was re -elected as his position in the board of directors. In his speech on shareholders, Musk also announced the start of Tesla's new generation of motor plans. He also believes that the global economy will begin to improve after 12 months.

Another project proposed at the shareholders' meeting is: "Key Person Risk" proposal. This proposal talks about the issue of succession and also requires Tesla to make a clear report on "key figures and behaviors to reduce potential losses." In fact, this proposal is mainly for Musk. These shareholders also require the company to formulate "a clear succession plan or strategy to reduce the impact of Musk once." However, the shareholders of the conference voted to veto the proposal. At the same time, Musk also said he did not resign from Tesla's chief executive.
On the occasion of the Tesla's shareholders conference, 15 of Tipranks's 30 analysts gave Tesla's "buy" rating, 11 rated "holding", and four gave "selling" selling "selling" to sell "The average target price of the one -year period is $ 202.84.

The British Finance Minister Hunter said that it is impossible to make a tax reduction commitment in front of the election that is expected to be held next year. The current top priority of Britain is to reduce inflation.
Bloomberg reported that Hunter wrote the above remarks during the 2023 British Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday (May 17) in London. He emphasized that Britain is trying to achieve the goal of reducing inflation, and at the same time allows interest rates to return to the decline.
Hunter pointed out that the government is currently unclear whether there is any tax reduction space (Headroom for TaxCuts), but he suggested that when it involves tax cuts, he gives priority to reducing commercial taxes. "We must reduce taxes and especially reduce corporate taxes, but the worst tax is inflation taxes."
Affected by inflation, people's nominal currency income increases, but the larger proportion of income will be transferred to government fiscal revenue in the form of taxation. This hidden tax increase caused by inflation is called inflationTax.
Prime Minister Sunak and his Conservative Party have been lagging behind the Labor Party in recent months. Sunak was under greater pressure from the party members in the party and asked him to reduce the British tax burden to attract voters.
However, Hunter said that he and Sunak were more focused on maintaining the reputation of the British in the financial market and hoped to avoid pouring fuel to inflation problems, thereby further increasing interest rates and borrowing costs.
Hunter also said that the authorities are considering subsidizing a strategic industry to respond to the United States' "Reduction of Inflation".

A report issued by the UN Environmental Planning Department shows that if various countries and enterprises use existing technology to conduct in -depth policies and market reforms, by 2040 [] It can reduce 80 %.
The report issued by the Environmental Planning Agency on Tuesday (May 16) pointed out that in the next few years, it is important that the world must minimize plastic products and reduce disposable plastic consumption to curb the aggravation of environmental pollution.
Agence France -Presse reported that the influence of plastic has attracted more and more attention. From the deepest trench to the highest mountain peak Mount Everest, micro -plastic fragments have been discovered. Human blood, breast milk, and placenta can also detect plastic fragments.
The report entitled "The Roots of cutting off: how the world ended plastic pollution and created a circular economy" was released two weeks ago in Paris negotiations. At that time, negotiating representatives of nearly 200 countries will hold a second round of negotiations in Paris, aiming to reach an agreement to terminate plastic pollution next year.
The report briefly introduces the scale and nature of the change of plastic pollution and the need to create a circular economy, and provide reference information for government decisions and business actions. It formulates a three -pronged approach based on reuse, recycling and material use, so that by 2040, it will generally reduce plastic pollution by 80 % and reduce disposable plastic output by half.
In 2020, about 238 million metric tons of short -term use of plastic waste, such as the packaging of goods. The report pointed out that time is crucial: delaying five years of implementation may lead to an increase of 80 million metric tons of plastic pollution by 2040. First, it is necessary to eliminate problems and unnecessary plastics to reduce the scale of problems.
The report quoted research estimates that by 2040, the greenhouse gas emissions of plastic may account for 19 % of global emissions.
According to the Paris Agreement passed by the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015. Countries agreed to control the global temperature rise of this century to the average temperature of two degrees Celsius during the average temperature higher than 1850 to 1900. The most ideal is to control the increase of the increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Greenhouse gas emissions caused by plastic may make the goal of the Paris Agreement unable to achieve.
The United Nations News Center quoted the Executive Director of the Environment Department, said: "The way we produce, use and handle plastic are polluting the ecosystem, bringing risks to human health, and destroying climate stability. If you follow this route, you can achieve a significant victory in economic, social and environmental aspects. "
However, environmental protection organizations believe that the plan listed in the report is not ambitious. The report assumes that the amount of plastic will continue to maintain a significant level. Xiao Chi Honglong, a member of the Green Peace Organization, said: "They try to change the pipeline, valve or anything else, but they have not tried to close the faucet ... they are not talking about reducing production."

 At the same time, Kiev officials are trying to eliminate doubts caused by the Russian army's claim to destroy a set of Patriot air defense systems provided by the United States.
Li Hui arrived at Kiev yesterday and began a two -day talks with the Ukrainian authorities. This is a part of his trip to Europe, which aims to promote the Russian -Ukraine conflict settlement plan proposed by Beijing.
Unknown high -level Ukrainian officials told AFP that Volodymyr ZELENSKYY may meet Li Hui "maybe this afternoon".
Three weeks after the Chinese President Xi Jinping and Zerrenceki, Li Hui became the highest -level Chinese diplomat who arrived in Kiev since Russia had completely invaded Ulan last February last year.
Kiev warned yesterday that "mediation for mediation" was unnecessary for Ukraine.
High -level officials of Ukraine pointed out: "Ending the war at the expense of Ukraine, this does not work."
Beijing stated that Li Hui's purpose was to "communicate with all parties on political resolution of the Ukrainian crisis."
Xi Jinping has always attempted to create the posture of China as a neutral mediation. He visited Moscow in March, but was criticized for rejecting to condemn the Kremlin's attack on neighboring countries.
