<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Hu Yongkong, Director of the China Research Center of Mokato China(Mikkohuotari)Calling the federal government to strengthen the coordination of Chinese policies within the European Union. In an interview with Reuters TV, he said: "We'd better be consistent with the European Commission."</p>
<p>The German government will propose on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国国安战略千呼万唤不出来/a-65872459">National Security Strategy</a>Essence Hu Yongkong is expected to have a "more critical speech for China's challenges internationally internationally", and emphasizes that China is an institutional competitor and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Hu Yankong warned not to take excessive means or reduce connection with China. He welcomed the German -Chinese government consultation that was about to be held in Berlin. He said that holding a meeting is the correct practice, and it is important to maintain a dialogue with difficult partners and put forward their own views. In November last year, Germany's agreement strengthened cooperation on the issue of hygiene and sustainable development. He believes that the talks will be a test of whether both parties will really take action. So far, cooperation in the above -mentioned field has not yet seen much progress. From a China perspective, consultation with an important Western country will be used as a successful selling point. "It can be said that the meeting itself is information."</p>
<h3>"Different Opinions of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party"</h3>
<p>Hu Yankong believes that in the analysis of China's development, the differences in the governing alliances composed of the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Democratic Party are less than that of the governing alliance. But he also said that "the party is indeed a correct way to deal with this issue." In particular, the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party have a "very different point of view."</p>
<p>At the same time, Hu Yongkong accused the federal government of lack of coordination within the European Union. "The federal government is not credible enough to European policy Europeanization."</p>

<p>But he also pointed out that when European countries are facing China, unity is very important. In response to the debate of the 5G mobile network and whether to use the Chinese parts manufacturer, Hu Yongkong said: "China's side will obviously try to draw Germany on these issues to ensure that the European Commission will not take a too tough position."</p>
<p>Germany is reviewing the use of 5G networks in China. In addition, the European Commission will propose a proposal about how to define economic security next week, which also involves technical control.</p>
<p>Hu Yankong warned: "Beijing will lobby Berlin to ensure that these measures will not be too severe." However, given the situation of geopolitical tensions, "it is necessary to think more widely than in the past."</p>
<p>In the interview, Hu Yankong also for some <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国企业为北京武统未雨绸缪/a-65871883">large -scale investment in German companies in China</a>Defense. He pointed out that people need "tolerance" macroeconomics and enterprises to have different views on new challenges. Some companies claim that new investment in China is due to the urgent demand or desire to realize localized production.</p>
<p>Hu Yongkong said: "It is correct to continue to obtain the maximum benefits from the Chinese market and should continue to do it." Different. In view of the conflict between the Taiwan Strait that may occur in the future, "the risk is significantly higher and it is difficult to predict." But he believes that the method of response cannot be evacuated from China.</p>
<p>He advocates that the investment review in the discussion focuses on limiting artificial intelligence or quantum technology, because China may obtain military interests from these fields.</p>
<p>Hu Yongkong also proposed a warning not to interrupt the scientific research exchanges with China. What currently needs is transparency, and what institutions and personnel are working in Germany. "But I think it is a very questionable view that treating every Chinese student or doctoral student as a threat." Hu Yimong emphasized that "must not be pursued to" reduce contact with China to solve all our problems "."</p>

<p>Huang Renxun, President and CEO of Huida, delivered a keynote speech at the Grace Hopper super chip at the Computex exhibition on May 29.</p>
<p><strong> This summer, artificial intelligence (AI) chip (chip, Chip) application show index level growth. According to analysis, this is due to various AI products such as ChatGPT and Midjouney, and the performance of AI chip has soared this year. </strong></p>
<p>It was once considered that during the epidemic, due to excessive production of chips, it was expected to face the semiconductor industry that slows production this year, but because of the increase in the demand of AI chips, it became the focus of the world again.</p>
<p>This also allowed the leader of the development of AI chips, NVIDIA, Nvidia, Nvidia). ), Jensenhuang, founder of Huida, has also become a new focus of the international fintech industry.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Huang Renxun believes that a series of bans in the United States have caused Chinese semiconductor companies to start producing their own AI chips and compete with Huida's current heroic games, drawing and artificial intelligence processors.</p>
<p>However, the AI chip industry cannot avoid geopolitical issues, especially in recent years, in the United States, "spicy tricks" have been continuously produced in the United States to try to restrain the development of the Chinese chip industry. Whether the White House will ban the front -edge companies such as Huida and other AI chips in the future AI chips to Chinese customers (such as Tencent or Baidu, etc.) are waiting and seeing the world. In the face of the US tribute methods that the United States may use, how to accelerate its own production of domestic AI chips, becoming the focus of the next US -China semiconductor war.</p>
<h3>AI chip, the US -China Semiconductor War</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that like oil, semiconductor cannot escape regional politics. The United States launched a trade war on sanctions against the Chinese semiconductor industry a few years ago, which was almost fully launched. Since TSMC and other companies are required to ban the sales of chips to China technology leader Huawei in 2019, the latter ’s mobile phone production line has been cut off and has been fully stopped so far. The chip bill implemented in the United States in 2022 requires those who have American green cards and nationality, and they cannot serve among Chinese semiconductor companies, causing strong protests in China.</p>
<p>Last month, China announced the sealing of Micron products to China. Bloomberg said that this was Beijing's export control measures for the United States. ","</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-54154051">The chip industry landscape changes to the U.S. Nvidia acquisition of Britain Moumou</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-63507362">Discuss the danger and card behind the Global chip war with the "Queen of Wall" in Taiwan</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65608208">Artificial Intelligence: How to see the impact of supervision and AI on employment</a>* [Who is the winner under the veil of "against globalization" in TSMC?(https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-63968240)Today, after entering the deep -water zone, the United States will follow the TSMC and Huawei model to start the full ban on the production of AI chips produced by American businessmen to China, becoming the focus of attention from all walks of life. Huida's customers in China include almost all China's technology e -commerce leaders, including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and Douyin's parent company. These companies are specially needed to sell AI chips on their sales products. AI chip technology is also an important technology involving military weapons and medical drugs, and its sensitivity is getting higher and higher.</p>
<p>Merchants feel particularly deep in the face of the US -China semiconductor war. In an exclusive interview with the Financial Times at the end of May this year, the host Huang Renxun said that in order to hinder the export control measures implemented by the semiconductor industry in China, Huida has "tied hands and feet". One sells several advanced AI chips.</p>

<p>Huang Renxun, an American technology entrepreneur born in Taiwan, founded Huida (Nvidia) in 1993.</p>
<p>Huang Renxun believes that a series of bans in the United States have allowed Chinese semiconductor companies to accelerate the production of their own AI chips and compete with Huida's current proud of the game, drawing and artificial intelligence processors. He emphasized that China "if there is no way to buy what you want, China will do it by itself, so the United States must face it with caution."</p>
<p>Professor Zhu Yuezhong, an expert in semiconductor industry and Professor Zhu Yuezhong of Nantai University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, told BBC in Chinese that Huida has not yet officially disclosed the proportion of Chinese revenue in the company's overall revenue, but he estimates at least 10%. In other words, the Chinese market has a great impact on the company. Zhu Yuezhong said that as a businessman, Huang Renxun was not surprising to have opinions on the United States' ban on China.</p>
<p>In addition, China's AI platform, such as Baidu or Alibaba, now develops the use of AI chips, and most of them still come from the US businessmen Huida and Chaou (AMD) before September 2022. Zhu Yuezhong said that the Chinese AI development platform is still not smooth like ChatGPT or Google. Therefore, after using high -end chips bought by the United States, China's AI development will inevitably encounter resistance.</p>

<p>American investors are also prohibited from holding or trading SMIC.</p>
<p>Of course, China has been developing domestic AI chips in recent years, including Cambrian, Haiguang Information and Baidu. However, Zhu Yuezhong believes that these AI chips need high -end chip factories to cooperate to mass production. However, the strongest company SMIC in China is now, and the highest chip process is only 14nm, so it is necessary to surpass the United States in a short time, and the possibility is very low.Tirias Research founder and semiconductor analyst Jim McGrego, the founder of Tirias Research, told BBC Chinese that the AI chip industry and the world need the United States and China to need more. It is elastic and willing to negotiate and lead development. He said: "Unfortunately, I don't think this will happen. We are moving towards a situation that forced industrial division and may cause economic disasters."</p>

<p>Some experts believe that chips have become "current oil" and are vulnerable to geopolitics and triggered the global crisis.</p>
<h3>AI chip?</h3>
<p>Like the oil of the last century, the chip was the main lifeblood of global technology operations. The chip is used in mobile phones, computers, military weapons (such as supersonic missiles) and automotoring. The use of high -end chips is the key to continuing to upgrade these products in the future.</p>
<p>AI chips were developed and produced in this context, and began to affect human life.</p>
<p>At present, it can be seen that the development of AI chips is accelerating the processing speed of machines and super computer learning and deep learning, so that users can make breakthrough progress in the fields of image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The emergence of AI chips has driven the development of autonomous driving, smart homes, the Internet of Things and other fields, bringing more intelligent application convenience and even risks to human daily life.</p>

The rapid development of AI chips has a lot to do with this. He said: "Artificial intelligence has been widely used in many different industries. Now we see its application in all industries, and there are multiple applications that can help people save time and money."</p>
<p>Therefore, some comments said that after World War II, changes in the contemporary economy, from "oil wealth" to "chip financial", are now entering "AI chip wealth".</p>

<p>Can ChatGPT write the opening of "The Night of the News", but can artificial intelligence save the technology giant?</p>
<p>Global scientists are entering the research and development of AI in the semiconductor field, and this year has made great further breakthroughs. Associate Professor Huang Chaozong of the Artificial Intelligence Research Center of Tsinghua University in Taiwan explained: "If the AI application is like a car changes the way human transportation, then AI chip is an indispensable fuel. It is necessary to provide the amount of fuel of the same level, which is the importance of AI chips in today. "</p>
<p>Long -term study of artificial intelligence and chip, the Huang Chaozong told BBC that the main reason for the attention of AI chips is the rapid rise of the recent "Gen AI" neural network.</p>
<h3>Key: Generate formula AI</h3>

<p>Therefore, some comments said that after World War II, changes in the contemporary economy, from oil finance to chip financial, are now entering AI chip wealth.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that applications for "generating AI" applications, such as text generation and image generation, will be foreseeable to be integrated into the workflow of individuals and enterprises. For example, Bingchat, ChatGPT, Google Bard, Office365 Copilot, Midjourney, etc. have begun to be integrated. The development of Huang Chaozong said that the development of "generating AI" is the key to how AI chips can continue to produce.</p>
<p>Huang Chaozong told reporters that the bottleneck of the previous AI development was that it was impossible to effectively and stably train oversized networks, especially its training materials was a quite large text library or gallery. However, in recent years, scientists have successfully found a suitable training method and established a huge genetic network that was unimaginable. The quality of its generation has also achieved the degree of unable to distinguish between human beings.</p>
<p>He believes that the current bottlenecks of implementation have become "how to make hundreds of millions of users in order in order to make inferences."</p>

<p>针对“生成式AI”，半导体分析师​麦格雷戈告诉BBC中文说，在未来10年内，AI将影响我们几乎所有的生活需求，譬如工作、娱乐或教育等等。</p>
<p>他指出：“AI的秘密在于不断发展的软体(software)。“他强调，在可预见的未来，AI多数是在很基础的用例上使用，譬如电池控制、监控或控制噪音上，大概占90%。但是，随着技术进步，特别是在生成式AI(Gen AI)的发展上，“AI预见将完成更具挑战性的任务，这是我们在ChatGPT 或Stable Diffusion等应用程序中所看见的。”</p>
<p>黄朝宗则说，在教育方面，已预见AI会是双面刃，一来可以加速积极性高的学生自我学习的速度，但另一方面也可能弱化学生自行整合知识的能力:“目前AI拥有的是基于庞大人为资料下的准确猜测能力，而非人类使用的因果推理能力，因此在使用上仍须相当小心。”他对BBC说。</p>
<h3>谁领先AI晶片的生产？</h3>
<p>以制作绘图晶片(GPU)起家的矽谷大厂辉达，在GPU非常适合进行AI计算的背景下，随着AI技术及应用产品自今年起爆炸性的发展下，多年投资在有了惊人回报。分析辉达之所以在AI晶片行业中领先，有几个因素。</p>
<p>首先，该公司在图形处理单元(GPU)领域拥有领先地位。GPU的高并行运算能力，使其成为训练和运行大规模神经网络的理想选择。此外，该公司多年来致力于开发专用于人工智能的硬体和软体工具(如TensorRT等)，这为开发者提供强大的工具和支援。</p>
<p>譬如，分析师萨格告诉BBC，“辉达在这个领域的很多主导地位都是来自该公司在软体方面投资的结果，特别是他们研发的产品CUDA(统一计算架构，能整合软硬体)，充分利用GPU的可编程性，提供高性能又易于开发的GPU。”</p>

<p>At the end of last year, Liu Deyin (second from right), the chairman of TSMC (second from right), was a wafer. The second left is Huida Huang Renxun.</p>
<p>Analysts McGregor explained that as the processing requirements increased, especially large language models (LLM), equipment, networks, and clouds' demand for more professional AI treatment are also increasing. He told the BBC that this processing requirements were integrated from the basic MCU (microcontroller unit) to SOC (system single chip), and now all the transactions such as the separation accelerator such as GPU produced by Huida. He said, "The reason why Huida became the leader of AI chips is not only because its chip dominates the cloud's AI training, but also mainly because the company continues to invest in development software tools and databases."</p>
<p>The Huang Chaozong of Tsinghua University observed that Huida began to work hard to maintain the developer platform more than 10 years ago, so that AI researchers can easily use their GPU for research. This is the deep reason why the company is currently difficult to replace. However, he also emphasized that if the chip has been recognized as the oil of the new era. Under this metaphor, the oil production company currently located in the throat is actually TSMC.</p>
<p>He believes that because Huida's TPU (tensor processor, which is a dedicated stagnant circuit developed by the company, for accelerated machine learning) is produced by TS -Power. "Therefore, in the future, AI chip chip in the future The development potential or bottleneck, TSMC plays an important role. "</p>

<p>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi died at Milan on June 12 at the age of 86.</p>
<p>This is the end of an era. It is difficult to imagine that it has no Silvio Berlusconi, although the country has been working hard to solve its identity during the post -Berluskinian era.</p>
<p>Over the past 50 years, his shadow has shrouded people on parliament, media, football and streets.</p>
<p>In the tribute film on Monday (June 12), Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni praised his "courage and determination", saying that he was one of the most influential people in the country's history.</p>
<p>"Through him, Italy knew that he could not allow himself to be restricted and never given up," she said.</p>
<p>During his heyday, Berluskini wore colorful headscarves on a yacht in the Geyin Sea, which may be mistaken for a pirate.</p>
<p>But he had a huge impact on Italian society and politics and became the object of highly complex civil and criminal investigations.</p>
<p>As a cruise singer, he enjoyed the pleasure brought by the audience who worshiped him for the first time, and the experience of becoming the center of the stage determines his adult life.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Berluskini has been a singer on a cruise ship.</p>
<p>As a media tycoon, he witnessed the dazzling American television network, and has since changed the Italian TV station. The exposed women defined many of his programs, just like they also dominated his private life.</p>
<p>This has caused the Italian culture to change, and they can suddenly watch a television show with political incorrect jokes and "Veline". "Veline" is a word in Italian, which means "Draft Girl".</p>
<p>For decades, the Italian television channel led by the public broadcasting company RAI has been rigorous and serious. Berluskini decided to put the audience's preferences first and create commercial television stations in Italy.</p>

<p>贝卢斯科尼决定把观众的喜好放在首位，在意大利一手创造了商业电视台(1986年资料照片)。</p>
<p>即便在今天，如果你浏览意大利的电视频道，你也不可避免地会遇到半裸的年轻女性。</p>
<p>贝卢斯科尼涉足政治并非出于意识形态的热情，而是出于保护其不断增长的商业利益的愿望。</p>
<p>他四度当选总理，吸引了广泛的选民。这位前娱乐大亨塑造了一个丰富多彩的形象，与之前制定意大利路线的保守知识分子形成了鲜明对比。</p>
<p>但这位被称为“骑士”(IlCavaliere)的人在意大利民众中评论两极，因为他的政策(包括他争议性地加入美国领导的对伊拉克的入侵)，以及他的整个生活方式。</p>
<p>2018年，当我作为BBC记者采访他时，我亲眼看到了这一点。在我们的谈话结束时，摄像机仍在拍摄，我们握了手。</p>
<p>This also reflects why many Italians hate him, because his obvious gender discrimination and disrespect to others, but others worship him as a "man's man".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-13T03-45-52.000Z/_87253815_87253814.jpg" /></p>

<p>图像加注文字，</p>
<p>贝卢斯科尼曾拥有意大利足球俱乐部AC米兰。</p>
<p>正如作家库尔齐奥·马拉巴特(Curzio Malaparte)所写，贝卢斯科尼的品质和缺点“是所有意大利人的品质和缺点”。</p>
<p>事实上，许多意大利报纸都认为是他在意大利发明了民粹主义。2010年代的多名右翼政治家常被拿来与他类比，其中包括特朗普(Donald Trump)。</p>
<p>贝卢斯科尼在允许极右翼进入主流政治方面发挥了关键作用。他与北方联盟(一个呼吁意大利北部一部分地区独立的政党)以及奉行新法西斯主义的全国联盟(AlleanzaNazionale)结盟，现任总理梅洛尼的政党就是该联盟的继承者。</p>
<p>梅洛尼本人在贝卢斯科尼的羽翼下首次成为知名政客，在其上届政府中担任初级部长。</p>
<p>贝卢斯科尼更希望给世人留下深刻印象。他把他在阿尔科雷的别墅改造成了一座带有文艺复兴时期画作的宫殿，他在撒丁岛的别墅看起来就像一个主题公园，包括一座喷发熔岩的假火山。</p>
<p>调查人员发现，这些别墅经常有女艺人和模特光顾，她们在那里收到礼物和装满现金的信封。</p>

<p>图像加注文字，</p>
<p>涉及性交派对丑闻的西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼和卡里玛·马赫鲁格(Karima El Mahroug)否认他们曾发生过性关系。</p>
<p>最终，并非“bunga bunga”性交派对压垮了他，而是其无力应对2011年意大利的债务达到不可持续的水平。</p>
<p>他在政治上的垮台发生在金融危机期间，当时意大利人认为他应对国家疲软的经济负责。</p>
<p>无数针对他受贿和腐败的刑事调查，以及臭名昭著的“bunga-bunga”性交派对的余波，也持续让他心力交瘁。</p>
<p>贝卢斯科尼的政治遗产是什么？他几乎没有进行任何政治改革。他似乎更关心营造自己的形象，而不是管理一个国家。</p>
<p>但他的大起大落催眠了一个国家。</p>

<h3>United Nations Report: In the past ten years, men and women have stagnated for ten years.</h3>

<p>Although social movements such as #Metoo have emerged in recent years, the problems of inequality in men and women have not improved.</p>
<p><strong> The United Nations Development Program announced the latest "Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI" on June 12, showing that nearly 90 % of the world's population still holds fundamental prejudice to women. 25 % believe that men beat their wives by men. It is justified. </strong></p>
<p>The survey results show that nearly half of the world's population believes that men are better political leaders than women, and only 27%believe that women enjoy the same rights as men is necessary for democracy.</p>
<p>In addition, 46%believe that men should have more job rights, 43%believe that men are more suitable for corporate executives, 28%believe that university education is more important to men, and 58%believe that abortion has never been correct.</p>
<p>The survey data comes from 80 countries and regions, covering 85%of the world's population. The report pointed out that although social movements such as #Metoo continued to emerge, gender prejudice was still ingrained, and more women in the new crown epidemic lost their income sources, which also caused the problem of gender inequality to deteriorate.</p>

<p>After the "anti -repair" movement in Hong Kong in 2019, a large number of young people were arrested and imprisoned for related protests. BBC interviewed the "anti -repair" motion demonstrators from prison, as well as supporting networks for helping people into prison for social movement cases.</p>
<h3>Witches: Attackers have appeared in the rally</h3>
<p>The attack clips were quickly spread in the community of the people in the Hong Kong -Hong Kong people. Some people uploaded a college student ID suspected to wear a man in white, referring to the man as a Southampton college student; however, the BBC Chinese reporter failed to confirm the identity of the person.</p>
<p>Ella (Ella), who is responsible for holding a local commemorative "Anti -Repairing" demonstration on June 12, pointed out that the white man in white appeared on the rally, shooting demonstrators, and once had a residence on Hong Kong's sovereignty issues and participating rallys. The British and Hong Kong people had a heated discussion, but did not cause conflicts.</p>
<p>Ella pointed out that more than 50 people attended the rally on the same day and the atmosphere was peaceful. Even though she applied for the approval of the British government, she also informed the police, but no police officer was present on the day.</p>
<p>In 2019, the "anti -repair" demonstration broke out in Hong Kong and opposed the amendment to the "Fugitive Regulations". The incident later evolved for more than a month and fought for democracy and freedom. student. After the wave of demonstrations, Hong Kong implemented the National Security Law, and civil society has undergone tremendous changes.</p>
<p>Aira pointed out that the initiative is looking forward to the original intention of Hong Kong people to participate in the "anti -repair" demonstration even after moving to the UK, and support a group of Hong Kong people who are in prison because of participation in the movement. Essence</p>
<p>Because the theme of the assembly opposed the Beijing regime's suppression of Hong Kong, some people holding the "Hong Kong independence" claim conflicted with some Chinese nationalists who supported the Beijing regime.</p>
<h3>Public letter from worrying about safety</h3>
<p>In recent years, when the people in the British and Hong Kong people participated in the demonstration rally in the UK, there were often incidents of conflict or someone attacked. In October last year, Hong Kong demonstrators were accused of being beaten when protest when protest outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester. Residents and Hong Kong people expressed their security issues during political opinions.</p>
<p>The people who were attacked or involved in the incident this time pointed out that they would not expect that they would also become a "premeditated attack" object because of political statements. They believed that the attack was premeditated and the goal was because when the man in white appeared in the rally, he had no friendly mentioning "calling friends to the scene"; and suspected that the diners were delayed by the four people, waiting for the attacker to arrive. When the two men got off the car, the two men got off the car and got off the car. Obviously, there is a goal and a national flag rushing directly to them.</p>
<p>Tiffany said that she moved to the UK after the implementation of the "National Security Law" in Hong Kong. , But the incident is undoubtedly scared and prohibitive when it comes to voicing.</p>
<p>Helen said that she would be careful in the future. "The place where I live is very close to the place of the incident. I am worried that it will be tracked or suffered again in the future."</p>
<p>Southampton Hong Kong people group organized a collective letter to the British media, the Cabinet Minister and Parliament MPs on Monday, urging them to condemn the incident. In the letter, "we just advocate basic rights, but have become the goal of violent attacks; and seeing that Hong Kong people are threatened by the security of Hong Kong people in the UK, it is particularly disappointing."</p>
<h3>Member of the parliament: "One person feels unsafe and is too much"There was no real -time handling case in the reporting center and the participants said that no police officers were at the rally at the time, and West said that it was "unexpected." She pointed out that there have been many similar incidents in the past few years, and in the British community, "one person thinks it is too safe." She believes that the authorities should take corresponding measures, including ensuring law enforcement departments in various places, noticing the security risks faced by Hong Kong and other communities, and ensuring that they can exercise citizenship safely.</h3>
<p>Roystonsmith, a member of the British Conservative Party, said "I am as worried as the Hong Kong community as much as the incident that happened yesterday and was pleased with the police's investigation attack."</p>
<p>He also said: "Although the incident has not been confirmed, I feel uneasy to see the violence against peace protesters. We are worried about the sinister nature of China and the opposition to freedom of speech in the university."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the University of Southampton responded, "We know the films circulating in social media, and are investigating", "the university condemn the violence of what form is, and respects each person's right to speech."</p>

Witnesses said that the German police should be shocked according to the picture, "Even the place where the person was sitting on the plane was very clear. Other passengers present said "more than one person who was taken away."</p>
<p>This week (June 14th to 16th), the European largest solar professional exhibition, the European International Solar Exhibition (Intersoleurope) in Munich. On the 12th on the 12th, there were many Chinese photovoltaic companies who came to participate in the exhibition. Someone immediately spread the news after witnessing the scene of "being taken away by the uniform". The incident caused a shock in the Chinese photovoltaic industry, and some reports said that even investors were worried that it would affect the stock price.</p>
<h3>Procuratorate: suspected economics illegal</h3>
<p>A Federal Police spokesman for the Munich Airport confirmed to Germany on the 12th that the police detained a passenger on a flight from Shanghai that morning to perform a arrest order issued by the Ogosburg District Court. In the afternoon of the same day, the man was sent to the court to meet the judge, and was later released.</p>
<p>Regarding the saying of "multiple people was taken away", federal police officers said that three of the passengers of the flight were briefly taken to the airport police station for inquiries because of visa issues. After the problem clarified, they left and left, only half an hour before and after. There is no connection between the two things.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-13T11-51-00Z/18507931_401.jpg" />Many Chinese manufacturers go to Munich to participate in the International Solar Technology Exhibition Intersola EUROPE(Data picture)The Voice of Germany asked the written reply from the Augsburg Procuratorate that the case involved illegal acts in the field of economic crimes from 2015 to 2017. During this time, the controlled person served as an executive of a Chinese photovoltaic product manufacturing enterprise and was responsible for exporting sales.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that according to the survey conclusions obtained by a series of search in 2018, the controller was determined that the subject was "major criminal suspect", but it was not yet possible to disclose more details about the allegations. On June 12, the court decided to suspend the execution of the "conditional conditions" on its arrest warrant.</p>
<p>According to the Beijing News, the named Pu Yonghua was indeed a senior manager in the Chinese photovoltaic industry. The report quoted public information showing that Pu Yonghua was born in 1976 and worked in Jiangsu Xiaosan Group, Jiangyin Junxin Technology Co., Ltd., and Jiangsu Runda Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. Pu Yonghua himself said that he was "okay" to the Beijing News.</p>
<p>According to Pu Yonghua's German lawyer, the prosecutor's allegations of the prosecutor's allegations of their parties were suspected of smuggling business and gangs, that is, avoiding import control. Pu Yonghua's release is to pay a deposit, and it is not allowed to leave Germany for the time being.</p>
<h3>There are precedents</h3>
<p>In the early morning of June 13, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association issued a statement that Chinese photovoltaic practitioners who reported media reports were taken away by the investigation when participating in the Munich International Solar Technology Expo in Germany. The statement said that after understanding, the parties "just assisted the investigation" and have returned to the hotel. The only one who assisted in the investigation this time was not involved in many Chinese photovoltaic companies that have been circulated on the Internet, and there were no situations where many personnel assisted the investigation.</p>
<p>A insider of the Association told the Shanghai Securities News reporter that "this is still a historical problem that the previous price commitment promised, and some illegal enterprises needed taxation."</p>
<h3>The embarrassment of Chinese photovoltaic products in Europe</h3>
<p>According to a comprehensive Chinese media report, Pu Yonghua served as a director and deputy general manager at Jiangsu Runda Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. from 2009 to 2020. He is now a major shareholder of Jiangzhulin Paul New Energy Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Runda is a listed company in the New Third Board. It was listed in May 2015 and has more than 800 employees. Green Paul is located in Changzhou, Jiangsu, with a total fixed asset value of 3 billion yuan. The company's business involves the upstream and downstream of the photovoltaic industry chain, from silicon wafers, battery films, components to power stations to design, build, and operation and maintenance; there are 3 warehouses in the European market, and the sales network is located in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and other places.</p>
<p>Chinese solar enterprise executives were arrested in Germany, not the first time. According to the German photovoltaic industry media PVMAGAGANE, in May 2019, during the Munich European International Solar Technology Exhibition, two Chinese citizens were arrested because of business smuggling involving solar components and evading illegal avoidance before September 2018 <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟拟终止对中国光伏产品反倾销措施/a-45214099"> EU's minimum price limit</a>Essence</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) President Palestine [Mahmoud Abbas]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/巴勒斯坦主席阿巴斯一语惊人引发众怒/a-62836975)On Tuesday (June 13), he arrived in Beijing and launched a four-day state-owned visit. With the dignitaries, the Minister of Foreign Diplomat Riyad Al-Maliki also held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on the day of arrival.</p>
<p>According to the Palestinian News Agency (Wafa), during the visit to China, the Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged opinions on "the latest situation in Ballaxtein and the international topic that both sides interested in".</p>
<p>Last week, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, said at a press conference that "President Abbas is the old friend and good friend of the Chinese people. He is the first head of the Chinese -Arab national head this year, which fully reflects the high -friendly relationship of China -Pakistan friendship. level".</p>
<p>He also said: "China has always firmly supports the justice cause of the Palestinian people to restore national legitimate rights."</p>
<p>According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Qin Gang stated in Ma Liji's talks that "China attaches great importance to the Palestinian issue and has always firmly supports the justice cause of the Palestinian people to restore national legitimate rights. , Chinese Power. "</p>
<p>Ma Liji said, "China is a trustworthy friend who can rely on," and appreciate Xi Jinping on a series of initiatives on the Palestinian issue to provide important support for Pakistan in the field of politics and development.</p>
<h3>Deepening Middle East Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Bloomberg pointed out that China has continuously strengthened its diplomatic influence in the Middle East in the near future to try to weaken the influence of the United States in the region; as the violence of the Pakistani has continued to deteriorate, Beijing also hopes to try to play the role of peace medal people in the international community. Essence</p>
<p>On April 17 this year, Qin Gang talked with Palestine and Israeli Foreign Ministers respectively, emphasizing that China was willing to play an active role in recovering peace talks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In December last year, Xi Jinping met with Abbas, the first China -Arab National Summit and the first China -Gulf Arab National Cooperation Commission summit at the Saudi capital of Riyada. Xi Jinping said in the meeting that China will continue to solve unremitting efforts to promote the Palestinian issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In March of this year, under China's diplomatic mediation, long -term opposite <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/沙特和伊朗外长在北京签署恢复邦交声明/a-65251448">Iran and Saudi Land realized historic reconciliation</a>, Restore diplomatic relations.

<p>A few days ago, the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fartach) Central Committee, Arab Relations and the Minister of Affairs of Arabia, ABBASZAKI, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that China and Palestine are "friends who are closer to brothers." He also said that President Abbas's visit will focus on the "Arab Peace Initiative" and look forward to China to continue to play a greater role in the future of Pakistan.</p>
<p>In terms of business economy and trade, China has also continuously strengthened cooperation with the Middle East.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that Abbas's economic adviser MohammedMustafa said that China seems to be increasing its economic and trade exchanges with Palestinian, and the two countries have reached principle agreements on 4 projects in China. These projects are located in the West Bank region occupied by Israel, including solar power generation devices, solar panel production plants, steel factories and road infrastructure.</p>
<p>Mustafa said that he hopes that the agreement can be signed preliminary when the presidential presidential meeting.</p>

<p>In today's digital age, with the rapid development of blockchain technology, people's attention to data privacy and security is getting higher and higher. In order to achieve more efficient and scalable blockchain applications, many solutions have been proposed, and one of them is Zero-Knowledge Proof technology. Zero -knowledge proves that as a powerful cryptography tool, it can verify the authenticity of a statement without leaking sensitive information.</p>
<p>In recent years, Zkrollup, as an important innovation of blockchain expansion technology, has attracted widespread attention. ZKROLLUP is packed in a large number of transactions, executed under the chain, and uses the characteristics of zero -knowledge to verify the correctness of these transactions, which significantly improves the throughput and scalability of the blockchain. In the implementation of Zkrollup, how to distribute and pack transactions and generate proofs have become an important part of the Zkrollup system.</p>
<p>In the Layer1 system, the transaction is packed in the form of a block and calculated by the miner. In the Layer2 system, how to pack transactions, or how to generate a layer2 block, requires separate considerations.</p>
<p>FOX is a project based on ZKEVM's Layer2zkrollup capacity. For this problem, FOX is exploring the processing method of using a assembly line to batch the transaction in batches, which is expected to greatly improve efficiency.</p>
<p>This article will in -depth applications to generate zero -knowledge proof of the assembly line. First, we will analyze the basic transaction packaging method. Subsequently, we will focus on the technologies of zero -knowledge certificate on the line of water lines, and analyze their principles and application scenarios in detail.</p>
<p><strong> Conventional transaction packing method </strong></p>
<p>In the traditional blockchain system, the confirmation and packaging of transactions is a time -consuming and resource -dense process. Under normal circumstances, the transaction is verified and added to the block one by one, and then reached an agreement through the consensus algorithm, so that the state of the blockchain can be updated. However, this method of verification and packaging has obvious limitations, including problems such as low throughput and high latency.</p>
<p>In the conventional transaction packaging process, first of all, a batch of transactions to be dealt with will be collected, which can be transactions submitted by users or transactions from other chains. These transactions are then verified to ensure its legitimacy and effectiveness. These verifications include checking the signature of the transaction, the effectiveness and consistency of the verification transaction. Once the transaction passes the verification, they will be packaged into a batch to form a block to be submitted.</p>
<p>In the ZK -Rollup system, the transaction submitted by the user will also be placed in the trading pool first. In the FOX system, the Sequencer will regularly capture the transactions in the trading pool and execute and sort. Blocks, at this time, the transaction execution results will be submitted to Layer1, and this result and transaction data will be submitted to the Folder node generated by the transaction data.</p>
<p>According to our basic understanding of the zero -knowledge proof algorithm (readers can refer to the previous series of FOX). If Folder wants to generate a proof, you must get the input and execution results, which will make if you follow the conventional way, you need to wait for the Sequencer After all the transactions are executed and then handed over to Folder. In order to make more effective use of computing resources, we hope that Sequencer will immediately leave to Folder to the Folder after performing a part of the transaction.</p>
<p><strong> FOX is exploring the assembly line processing mode </strong></p>
<p>In order to achieve the above goals, we need to let Sequency execute the transaction in batches and immediately send the intermediate results to Folder after a batch is performed.</p>
<p>Specifically, assuming that the total number of transactions transactions is 100, and the number of single batch transactions is 10, the flow line processing method can be represented by the following figure.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-13T23-07-52-00-00/000184232_piclink.jpg" />Figure 1: Filmline mode generate transaction certificate</p>
<p>Next, let's briefly analyze the time overhead of the two methods, and discuss how to use the assembly line to have higher efficiency under what circumstances. To simplify the time, the discussion here did not consider the time when Sequencer sent the data to Folder.</p>
<p>The number of transactions for transaction packages is n, and the number of batches is K.(), Folder's proof -generating time function is provy()The time function of the aggregation certificate is AGGR()The total time of the conventional method is SUM1, and the total time of the assembly line is SUM2.</p>
<p>So in accordance with the above process, the conventional method depends on the sequence to execute and then the folder to prove it. The total time you need is</p>
<p>SUM1 = EXE(n)+prove(n)The time of the assembly line should include the execution time of Sequence for the first batch of transactions, as well as the time for the proof of the proof and the larger batch execution time, as well as the final aggregation time.</p>
<p>SUM2 = EXE(n/k)+max{k<em>prove(n/k),(k-1)</em>exe(n/k)}+Aggar(k)So compare the total time between the two and the execution time function EXE()It can basically be similar to linear functions, but for provy()Because the proof algorithm of the FOX system proves that the generating time is linear function, ProVE()It is also a linear function.</p>
<p>It can be concluded:</p>
<p>If exe(n)&gt;prove(n)Then when prove(n)&gt; Aggar(k)At that time, Sum1&gt; Sum2.</p>
<p>If exe(n)If(k)At that time, Sum1&gt; Sum2.</p>
<p>So, if the aggregation time Aggr(k)It is small enough and prove that the generating time is a linear function, the use of the assembly line is very helpful to improve the efficiency of the system and reduce the total generating certificate time.</p>
<p>The above analysis only proof of the linear time proof of the establishment of the algorithm. From this point, it can be seen that the import of linear time to prove the importance of the algorithm is also seen.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-13T23-07-52-00-00/000184233_piclink.jpg" />Figure 2: Prove the calculation flowchart<strong> Packing and packaging of transactions is efficiently distributed and packed, and proof of generating one by one is the key optimization point </strong></p>
<p>In Zkrollup, it is a key optimization point to allocate transactions and generate proof. FOX is constantly optimizing the model to find more efficient solutions. The following is the basic process used by FOX:</p>
<p>Transaction collection: Collect transactions to be treated and store them in a trading pool. These transactions may be transactions submitted by users, or transactions generated by other systems or contracts.</p>
<p>Transaction sorting: Sort the transactions in the trading pool to determine the order of packaging. Generally, sorting algorithms based on priority, timestamp or other factors can be used. The goal of sorting is to maximize the overall throughput and efficiency of the transaction.</p>
<p>Transaction allocation: allocate sorted transactions to the appropriate block. In Zkrollup, a new block is usually created to accommodate a certain number of transactions. The distribution process can use the greedy algorithm or other distribution strategies to maximize the capacity utilization of each block.</p>
<p>Block packaging: Packing the distributed transactions to form a complete block. In the layer2 architecture of FOX, this block actually only contains the summary information of the transaction. This abstract information can be a profile of the trading hash or other forms of compactness, not the detailed content of the transaction. The detailed transaction information will be stored in storage. In the Ringer of FOX, data availability (DA) is achieved.</p>
<p>Proof generation: The corresponding proof of the packaging block is generated. This proof should be able to prove the effectiveness of each transaction in the block and the consistency of the entire block. FOX's assembly line mode is mainly used in this link. It is used to use Folder's computing power more efficiently to transmit transactions in a block to Folder to prove it. Folder proves the correctness of each batch of transactions, and finally aggregates. Generally, this proof is based on the fast -targeted zero -knowledge certification algorithm such as FOAKS. By comparing the transaction in the block with the status conversion rules to verify whether they follow the system's rules and constraints.</p>
<p>Proof Verification: The receiver can use proof to verify the effectiveness of the block without re -calculating the entire block. This verification process can be highly effective, because it only involves inspections of proof, and does not need to complicate the transaction.</p>
<p>FOX's "assembly line mode" mainly occurs in proof of the generation. In transaction collection and sorting, Sequenceer collects transactions to be processed, and sort them in accordance with some rules to determine the order of execution. In the subsequent execution of transactions in batches, Sequencer executed the sorted transactions in batches. A set of transactions in each batch were sent to the execution engine for processing. Execute the engine simulation of these transactions and record the intermediate results of the state conversion. After each batch of transactions is executed, Sequencer sends the intermediate results to Folder.</p>
<p>This can be completed by the communication channels sent to Folder by batching the intermediate results in the form of state update, trading hash. Folder will use these results after receiving the intermediate results of each batch, so as to generate corresponding proofs in batches. The generation of these proofs is based on FOX's self -developed Foaks zero -knowledge certification algorithm, and its intermediate results are used as input to prove the effectiveness of the transaction and the consistency of the entire block.</p>
<p>The last step is to prove the verification. The generated proof is sent to the verification party, that is, the smart contract deployed in Ethereum Verifier to verify the effectiveness of the block. Verifier uses the verification algorithm to check the proof to ensure its correctness and legality.</p>
<p>Through this assembly line method, Sequence can continue to send the intermediate results to Folder while performing the transaction, so as to generate a batch of proof. This can improve the efficiency and throughput of the entire system, while reducing the delay of proof.</p>
<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>This article introduces a solution that is relatively novel in Zkrollup, a scheme for generating a proof of generating a proof of transaction in batches, and analyzing the time overhead of this method in detail. For the linear proof algorithm, a reasonable use of the assembly line can be used. Helps reduce the total proof of proof. The proof system adopted by FOX has achieved a linear proof time, which is very helpful for rapid generating proof and improving the user experience. The FOX team will continue to explore and optimize this solution.</p>

<p>Gold has been favored by investors again. This time, many factors have consolidated the important position of gold -from the turbulence of the banking industry to the geopolitical tension, inflation concerns, and the increasing concern of the US dollar as the main reserve currency.</p>
<p>Although gold does not generate cash flow, it is an important strategic asset in a balanced investment portfolio. As of the end of May, gold has risen by 21%from the low point last year. In the environment full of uncertainty and unpredictable changes today, we believe that gold may break through historical highs later this year, and reached $ 2,200/ounce in March 2024.</p>
<p><strong> Fed interest rates may see top </strong></p>
<p>First of all, the US dollar softening is often conducive to asset categories related to the US dollar, including large commodities including gold. After experiencing an unprecedented austerity of monetary policy about 14 months ago, the main central bank finally slowed down the pace of interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>The Fed, the European Central Bank and the British Bank of the United Kingdom all announced their interest rate hikes at a policy conference in May, while the European Central Bank and the British Bank both hinted that they will continue to raise interest rates in the future.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Fed released a signal that interest rates may be up soon. More importantly, although the possibility of raising interest rates this year is questionable, history shows that when the Fed starts to cut interest rates, the speed is often fast.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's "dotmate" implies 3.5 interest rate cuts in 2024, and the futures market is included in the federal fund interest rates will reach about 3.4%. Compared with the European Central Bank and the British Bank, the Fed's argument is more pigeon, which may create favorable conditions for the US dollar weakened and further support gold prices.</p>
<p>The DXY dollar index has fallen by about 9%since its 20 -year high. Due to unfavorable factors such as the tightening of loan standards and the deterioration of scientific and technological expenditure trends, the advantages of GDP growth in the US GDP will further narrow, and the US dollar will be exhausted in the future.</p>
<p><strong> Go to the US dollar in the brewing </strong></p>
<p>Reserve currency diversification is taking root global. This trend began to emerge during the global financial crisis, and Russia was further strengthened after the outbreak of Russia and Ukraine's conflict. According to data from the International Monetary Fund, the proportion of the US dollar in global foreign exchange reserves has fallen from 72%in 1999 to 58%at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>It should be clear that the US dollar is unlikely to lose its position as the largest international reserve currency in the short term, and its holdings are still much higher than 20%of the second -ranked euro. But countries are seeking alternative options, and gold has always been the main beneficiary.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that although the actual interest rate of 10 years since May 2022 has turned to a positive value, central banks of various countries are still hoarding gold. Data from the World Gold Association show that the number of gold purchased by the central bank in 2022 is the largest since 1950. For example, Singapore's gold holdings in March 2023 reached 222 tons, an increase of 45%over the end of 2022.</p>
<p>At the same time, some developing countries are adopting measures including bilateral agreements to improve the attraction of alternative currencies in international trade settlement.</p>
<p>As the geopolitical situation heats up, gold as the most traditional hedge tool will further benefit from the increase in risk aversion needs. According to a recent survey by Bloomberg, 52%of professional investors (and 46%of retail investors) regard gold as the safest assets. The popularity of the second largest hedge tools of interviewees, the popularity of U.S. Treasury bonds is only one -third of the gold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the US debt is concerned about ease or interest rate expectations, which may be pressured by gold prices. However, considering the current structural support, the price callback should be temporary.</p>
<p><strong> physical assets are attractive diversified tools </strong></p>
<p>In general, in the post -epidemic era, as investors' demand for "physical assets" such as commodities, infrastructure and real estate has increased, and the price of gold has also risen.</p>
<p>As countries seeking risks, diversification, and establishment of local supply chains may lead to inflation pressure continues to higher than the normal level before the epidemic. This then strengthened the principle of investing in physical assets such as gold, because these assets are the source of diversified returns with attractive diversification.</p>
<p>How much funds to be assigned to physical assets and alternative assets depends to a large extent on the investment period of investors and insufficient tolerable capabilities. UBS believes that in general, up to 20%of the investment to the asset category with a weak liquidity should make most investors avoid liquidity problems. If the demand for cash flow in the investment portfolio Configure 40%of the funds to low liquid assets.</p>
<p>As for gold, history shows that it is an effective diversified tool, especially during the turbulence of the geographical economic turbulence, such as the three major risk events in recent decades -European debt crisis, global financial crisis and new crown epidemic.</p>
<p>For the balanced US dollar investment portfolio, UBS analysis shows that in recent decades, about 5%of the gold configuration can increase risk adjustment and reduce retracement.</p>
<p>Investors should fully consider all different options to reduce risks and stabilize investment portfolios. During a period full of uncertainty, diversified layout is often the best defense strategy. Compared with any time in the past, it is the best time to evaluate the situation and manage the category of assets and properly hedge future risks.</p>

<p><strong> A well -known chain private kindergarten in Banqiao, New Taipei City, Taiwan has recently occurred in the case of "controlled drugs" in the feeding of the hospital, which shocked Taiwan and caused panic in Taiwan's parents. </strong></p>
<p>According to Taiwan media reports, a franchise store in the "Genduba Kindergarten" in the downtown area of New Taipei City has recently been accused of feeding children's unknown drugs by parents. Some parents said that they found that their children had experienced self -harm and irritability in recent months. After asking the child, they learned that the "unknown medicine" that the teacher feeded and adjusted was induced to use children.</p>
<p>After the parents were sent to the medical examination, they found that many children were detected in the residue of controlling drugs such as Phenobarbita and notified them. After the media was exposed, it caused panic in Taiwan, and public opinion has not showed signs of calming.</p>
<p>The New Taipei City Government stated on Monday (June 12) that at least eight young children are currently experimented with a small amount of "phenobarbich" and "phenyl nitrogen" in Taiwan as three -level control drugs in Taiwan; On the same day, 22 parents told the kindergarten and the teacher, and collected 12 hair tests for appraisal agencies. The kindergarten was also required to be suspended by New Taipei City on the same day. The 67 children in the park had 25 children transferred to school, and the remaining 42 young children were arranged for resettlement.</p>
<p>The New Taipei Procuratorate of Taiwan said that if a parent reports, or if the suspect is suspected of criminals, it will collect children's hair for investigation. The kindergarten has denied the allegations to take any controlled drugs for children.</p>

<h3>Parent's voice</h3>
<p>A five -year -old father, Mike, told BBC in Chinese that returning from a long vacation in the lunar calendar this year, the parents of the kindergarten have noticed the child's health. He told reporters: "Parents have discovered that during vacation, that is, during the suspension of the drug, emotional anger, irritability, unstoppable screams when sleeping, and even crowded feet and crying. I was surprised. "</p>
<p>Another lady "Xiaoxin Mom" told BBC in Chinese that the three -year -old son Xiaoxin entered the kindergarten before he was a child who was in school and was not afraid of adults. It was greatly retreated by yourself. It turned out that it was only the normal reaction of the development stage. Now that I think about it, there is a trace to find it, "she said.</p>

<p>Hou Youyi, a candidate for the Kuomintang 2024 presidential election, is also the mayor of New Taipei City. He was overwhelming in the New Taipei Mayor election last year, but now, the parents of New Taipei City questioned the slow crisis.</p>
<p>Xiaoxin's mother told reporters that she quickly transferred her son to school. After that, her son had obviously increased his smile and improved his physical spirit. , Children can finally disclose the atrocities of the teacher in the past -'I used to be afraid to hide', 'Teachers will use hard stationery who can fight other people' When comparing the front and back, you can know how much physical and mental damage the school brings to the child!For the mother, every time you know it, it is extremely impact and heartbreak!"</p>
<p>Mike said that parents notified before May this year. After the incident on May 18 was exposed in the media, other parents began to report on May 22, indicating that more than one child was fed, but the New Taipei City Government waited until June. On the 5th, the second expanded search for other teachers and principals was expanded. The efficiency of the municipal government's processing efficiency made them very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Xiaoxin Mom criticized the parents of New Taipei last week to criticize the parents. She believed that she would have no public transparency at all. She said that the case is a major public issue, but only the guardian participates in the media and public opinion representatives to participate in these two meetings. ? Parents who have not been free to participate, write authorization books to relatives and friends to attend, and it is not allowed. "</p>
<p>She emphasized that the general administrative households and even the court can allow the parties to authorize her to participate. explain.</p>
<p>This children's health incident seemed to have risen storms in Taiwan's politics. This is because as the Kuomintang 2024 presidential election candidate, Hou Youyi is also the mayor of New Taipei City. He won an overwhelming victory in the New Taipei Mayor's election last year, but now, the parents and public opinion in New Taipei City have questioned the crisis. Essence Whether this incident will affect its top attack is the new focus of Taiwan's politics.</p>
<h3>Why does the controlled drug appear in kindergarten?</h3>
<p>According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, the president and staff of the kindergarten confessed that parents agreed to feed their children with cold potion. But parents denied that the garden party said that they took out the child's medication list and said that there was no such thing: "Which doctor and parents will agree to eat 'phenobarbad' for their children?" Parents said.</p>
<p>However, Hong Zhengxian, a pharmacist at Taiwan Xiuchuan Hospital, told Taiwan Media Union News. "Some cough drugs and gastrointestinal drugs contain phenobarby, and they are not pipe drugs. New News Weekly also said that according to the magazine survey, at present, Taiwan Pharmaceutical Factory has manufactured phenobabic drugs. A total of 9 models have obtained medicine certificates, and 6 indications are relatively common gastrointestinal diseases. ","</p>
<h3>What is phenylbiby?</h3>
<p>Yan Zonghai, director of the Department of Clinical Poison, Taiwan Chang Geng Hospital, told the media that phenobarbich is a category of drug components, and almost all of them are oral drugs. He said that phenobarbur drugs are mostly used for the treatment of epilepsy and surgical anesthesia, which is difficult to obtain controlled drugs.</p>
<p>Phenobarbich is also used for compound drugs (including 2 or more effective ingredients). In addition to epilepsy, drugs that treat gastrointestinal tract and respiratory diseases will also appear. Yan Zonghai said that excessive use may cause drowsiness, and even inhibit the danger of life. Moreover, children will have addictive signs. When the application is stopped suddenly, there will be symptoms of restless abstinence.</p>
<p>Decades ago, Taiwan had underground drug -making factories and sold related drugs "red" in underground circulation. It has led to serious social and public health problems. The drug slowly disappeared later.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-14T01-39-15-08-00/13india-brides-wmgb-master1050.jpg" />Punjab has been the center of Indian immigrants for a long time. Salindip Kurok, like many women there, eager to marry Indians working abroad, and follow him to live a richer life overseas.</p>
<p>On January 13, 2014, she thought her dream came true. In a Sikh temple that day, she married Harbine Singh, who had just returned from Italy, and moved into a residence with his family.</p>
<p>However, a few days later, her in -laws began to ask for about $ 10,000 so that her husband could move to Canada to live. According to the police report, because she failed to raise money, they did not give her food and beat her. The alarm did not cause any allegations.</p>
<p>Eight weeks after the wedding, her husband returned to the Italian dairy field to continue his work. Koh never saw him again. "It has become a few weeks a few days, and then a few months," she recently said at home in the village of Garthnana. "I have been looking forward to seeing him."</p>
<p>There is more than Kuris who suffers from suffering. According to government officials and activists, tens of thousands of Indian women were abandoned by husbands working abroad. According to local social customs, many women were trapped in her in -laws, and some for decades.</p>
<p>Some women abandoned by her husband were harmed by their husbands who did not fulfill their life encounters. However, some of them were deceived thoroughly, and their family was deceived by dowry, honeymoon costs and visa costs.</p>
<p>Husbands run away, and there are almost no special legal relief measures to help these women. If men are abroad, they may be difficult to hunt according to relatively general laws. However, eight women have submitted a petition to the Supreme Court of India to urge the government to formulate policies to solve their common problems.</p>

<p>A former judge who led a committee who investigated the problem by Punjab said that such a case was only 30,000 in the state.</p>
<p>Punjab is the only state in India, which has the majority of Sikhs. It has some of the most fertile farmland in the country, but it has been suffering from unemployment and drug abuse problems for a long time. Publicity English Training Center and Visa Consulting Corporation's billboards are evidence that the population is lost abroad. Young people often force older relatives to sell the land so that they can immigrate.</p>
<p>In the most recent afternoon, in the Village of Cotti, surrounded by sugarcane fields, a dozen older men were sitting under a tree at the ring road to discuss the problem of farmers who were in trouble: low income, huge debt, and some of them. People choose to commit suicide.</p>
<p>"This is why everyone wants to fly out of Punjab to realize their dreams of dollars," said the 65 -year -old retired teacher Satnan Singer said, "The tragedies of these women are caused by these desires to a certain extent."</p>
<p>He said that some husbands wanted to fulfill the promise of bringing their wives abroad, but unpredictable events or strict visa regulations prevented them.</p>

<p>Activists and experts described a more disturbing situation, and this situation was also seen in an interview with 12 women.</p>
<p>They said that this is usually the case: parents arrange to marry their daughter to a Indian who returned from abroad. They paid dowry, and this approach was prohibited in India, but it is still common. Next, a luxurious wedding, including a few days of meals and drinks, and dancing with Punjab music. Then the honeymoon, also paid by the bride's family.</p>
<p>The husband flew abroad, his wife lived in her in -laws, waiting for a visa. The in -laws asked his wife to ask for a visa, but the visa was never obtained. His wife is often unaware of, and her in -laws are closely monitored to control her, and they are psychologically traumatic.</p>
<p>For Kobe, who fled from the in -laws five months later, "like living in a dark dungeon."</p>
<p>It may also lurk other dangers. Some women complained that "they were exploited by other family members of their husbands due to no way," said retired judge Rakash Kumar Camal Gagger, and he recently led a committee to conduct investigations in the state.</p>
<p>In many cases, men use dowry to pay for immigration agencies to enter rich countries such as Canada, and Sikhs account for about 2%of Canadian population.</p>
<p>"These guys are here, they enjoy, and then leave with dowry money," Gay said. "Then they get married again in foreign countries to get citizenship. This is betrayal."</p>
<p>Punites, left -behind women can be seen everywhere -this indicates that the urgent desire to leave makes them ignore the lessons of the front car.</p>

<p>"One lives here," said Kurwin Cobell, saying that she was deceived in 1999. She pointed at a door on the right side of the house from her own terrace. "There is another living there," she pointed to a bamboo door on the left side of the house and said."I am like his servant," she said.</p>
<p>Recently, a clear morning, the head of the left -behind woman supported the organization of ABBNHI Sat Wind Costeni Sati to talk to the visitors at the home of Rudiana. At this time, her phone rang.</p>
<p>"Can you help me?" A woman asked crying on the phone. She said that she was beaten by her mother -in -law because she did not arrange money for overseas husbands.</p>
<p>In this woman's home, Satty encouraged her to report the case to the police, but she wanted to wait a few months. Sati also said that she was the victim of the wedding scam. "Remember, your husband will never take you out," Sati told her. "Either call the police, or die."</p>

<p>Some women are fighting for her husband's passport. English teacher Lamith Hallet sends an email reminder to the authorities every week to ask them to cancel her husband Haplet Singh Singer Drumman's passport.</p>
<p>According to a federal law, if he repeatedly refuses to appear in court, he may be revoked by the Indian passport of his wife's abroad.</p>

<p>Hallar said she paid about $ 8,000 procedures and visa fees to her in -laws. Her father -in -law Case Singh denied this statement.</p>
<p>"Let her get evidence," Singh said on the phone. He also said that his son filed a divorce before leaving India because the two could not get along. Hallar said that she received a notice from a lawyer on a divorce application at the end of last month. In this case, few women have proposed divorce due to cultural and economic reasons.</p>

<p>Hallar reported the case to the police and accused her husband's family violence -due to lack of special laws for escaping husbands, the police often investigated such allegations -and monitored her with a camera. Like most cases in India, this case has progressed slowly.</p>
<p>"I want to give him a lesson," she said, "So he will always remember everything he does to me."</p>
<p>Hargin Singh, a dairy worker who was married and worked in Italy, said that after his wife reported the case, he also faced domestic violence allegations. During the telephone interview, he refused to provide his party, and also refused to defend his wife's behavior. "I have nothing to add," Singh said.</p>
<p>The last night, Kohs stood on the terrace of his parents' house, and a man in a white shirt walked through a small road in the center of the wheat field.</p>
<p>"I really hope it is him," she said in a small voice. "But I know he will never come back."</p>

<h1>Confidential documentation report: A tense and quiet Trump</h1>

<p>Description: This is the first time that a former president has been promoted by the federal allegations, and a bail agreement is finally reached. Trump once claimed that his prosecution was political persecution, but he said nothing in court, and body language showed that he understood the severity of this unprecedented legal war. Doug Mills/The New York Times President Trump condemned his prosecution as a political persecution, but did not say a word in court.</p>

<p>About six meters away, the second row of the attending seats was the special prosecutor Jack Smith who sent him to the defendant. Smith looked at the three lawyers of his subordinates of the judicial department to Trump a bail agreement to allow him to be released under his guarantee without the need for bail. This agreement is a kind of respect and tolerance, but it also means great humiliation.</p>
<p>After a 50 -minute meeting and unprecedented court meeting in the history of the United States, Trump walked out from a side door inlaid with dark wooden boards, but before leaving, he glanced back and glanced at the room and squeezed in the room. About 40 reporters.</p>
<p>About a minute later, Smith and his team walked to the other side of the room and left without a word. He didn't look back.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the former president has been promoted by the federal allegations, and it is also the first public meeting when Trump and Smith, when the document case cases in the Malaras Manor. The two did not communicate with each other. However, these two opponents who have no similarities are locked in a legal war that has a huge political and legal influence on this polarized country.</p>
<p>Trump's body language in court shows that he understands the seriousness of the situation. A former president who was happy to control the power seemed uncomfortable as the defendant's power.</p>
<p>Trump has condemned his prosecution as a political persecution and said that Smith was a "thug", but at the hearing, he said nothing. Altar Judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/us/politics/jonathan-goodman-trump-judge.html">Jonathan Goodman</a>He didn't ask him any questions, and this situation sometimes happened in criminal messages.</p>
<p>Trump promised to say more later. Someone saw several supporters of his political assistants outside the court with a group of supporters with a large number of people but loud voice, and their shouts were intertwined with the roar of a helicopter above their heads.</p>
<p>In court, the hearing itself looks quiet and extremely civilized.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the former president, accompanied by his two lawyers Chris Toppvy and Todd Blanci, he waited patiently for at least 15 minutes until Judge Goodman entered the court. When Kishe dealt with the work of the document, Trump and Branch were close to each other, clinging to the other's ears, and laughed once or twice. For a few minutes, the former president seemed to be relaxed.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>But at 2:45 pm, the atmosphere suddenly changed. A court official announced that the closed -circuit camera has been opened, and it will transmit the hearing scene to the conference hall of the jury on the fifth floor of the news media. The former president straightened his waist and stared at the camera, seemed to realize the power of the camera.</p>
<p>Trump likes to appear in the White House under the gang of the national flag, and often stands in front of the presidential seal. On Tuesday, he found that he was standing at the other end of the picture. In the largest and most modern hearing room in Wilki Ferguson Court, Judge Goodman sat on the marble judge, a few meters taller than others, and next to the American flag.</p>
<p>It is unclear how long Trump and his co -defendant Walter Aya stayed in court. Before the court, the U.S. Bulletin registered them and collected electronic fingerprints. But just after 2:40 pm, when the reporters were led into the room, the 45th president of the United States was sitting in his own position, and there were dozens of courts and security staff.</p>
<p>Most of the contents of the hearing are concentrated on the details of the Trump Blockbound Agreement. Smith's senior prosecutor abandoned the bail requirements, or any other prerequisites that may be regarded as damaging dignity or excessive restrictions. They insisted on asking Trump not to discuss the case with Naita. Naita is still hired as a former president as a personal assistant.</p>
<p>Judge Goodman asked to reach a more severe agreement, and it was recommended that Trump prohibited any contact with important witnesses. His lawyer responded that witnesses, including Trump's private staff and security personnel, asked them to cut off the contact.</p>
<p>Prosecutors seem willing to cooperate. One of the senior prosecutors of Smith, Deli Habach, asked the court to make the two sides finalize the details. The previous draft bail agreement was abandoned, but the third draft of the agreement had been printed and Trump signed it. "The third time must be successful," Said Judge Goodman.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The judge is the only participant who looks relaxed, perhaps because he is the only person who is about to leave the case. Before Judge Irene Kannon took over the trial, another local judge would host a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>"The good news is that that person is not me," Judge Gudman said before dissolution.</p>

<p>In the context of the rapidly occupying AI technology highlands of the scientific and technological competition and capital of Greater Power, Wang Feng, editor -in -chief of FT Chinese website, said that the strong regulatory actions of the AI "Step on the brake" recently called for the recent call for AI However, it is still possible to make progress in several limited directions, such as allowing platforms and users to have tools and capabilities to identify AIGC.</p>
<p>On June 8th, the Ministry of Education of East China Normal University invited Wang Feng, editor -in -chief of FT Chinese website to analyze related risks from the perspective of "pollution" from AIGC's learning content, machine generation content, and "pollution" of machine learning materials And the way of response.</p>
<p>The following content is organized according to the on -site speech.</p>
<p>"Artificial intelligence has just cracked the operating system of human civilization." On April 29th, Uvar Noah Herari, an Israeli historian, and the author of "Future Brief History", issued a warning on the Frontiers forum, saying artificial artificial artificially said artificially Intelligence is currently undergoing a language that has brought a threat to human beings. Because in the eyes of Herralia, language is the cornerstone of civilization. Openai and Google(Google)More than 350 AI industry executives and researchers from DEEPMIND and other companies, including the Turing Award winner of the AI "Godfather", Jeffrei Singon(Geoffrey Hinton)He Josya Benjio(Joshuabengio)Both signed a statement to observe the risks of "the risk of" extermination of AI "and the risk of" big epidemic and nuclear war ". Elon Musk also called for 6 months to suspend the development of advanced AI systems in March this year.</p>
<p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence is huge for the content industry. Like the "AI Sun Yanzi", which caused Sun Yanzi himself, many of the multimedia cases generated by AI have proved that AIGC has entered the fields of film and television, art, music, etc. that people have been considered as unable to be replaced by machines, which has caused business, ethics, and Law concerns.</p>
<p>At the same time, regulations and regulatory policies related to AI and AIGCs in various countries, regulatory policies, and industry specifications are in the turbulent and game period. The current rules may be rapidly outdated due to the rapid iteration of technology.</p>
<p>The U.S. Copyright Administration (USCO) issued a guidelines on March 16, 2023 that the automatic production of artificial intelligence (AI) was not protected by the copyright law.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-14T03-03-07-00-00/000184299_piclink.jpeg" />The Supreme Court Intellectual Property Judge Zhou Bo made an analysis made by Shenzhen Tencent Company's complaint of Shanghai Yingxun Company (2019.12.24 judgment). "Whether artificial intelligence generates can become a work for copyright and law," the second is "the ownership of the copyright of the work." In this case, the court found that the work was "human intellectual activity" completed by artificial intelligence, instead of the independent creation of artificial intelligence, so it could be protected by copyright law. There are also courts in the judgment that "the completion of natural person creation should still be a necessary condition for the works of the copyright law." In short, the current judicial practice of Chinese courts, whether artificial intelligence independent production products can become a work protected by copyright law. You also need to do further observation.</p>
<p>Most of the content platforms are still in the stage of exploration, discussion, and their respective implementation. The launch of the Chat Robot Bard attempts to show the attitude towards machines and humans in the AIGC -related guidelines with the guidance of ChatGPT launched by OpenAI, and claims that it will use tools such as spambrain to help identify the content of garbage. Regardless of whether the search results are AI, the search results are AI. manufacture.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-14T03-03-07-00-00/000184300_piclink.jpeg" />Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales (Jimmy Wales) posted on March 30 in The Eveningstandard that Wikipedia must be very careful about ChatGPT's "out of nothing". According to VICE reports, the non -profit organization Wikipedia Media Foundation behind the website(Wikimedia Foundation)Studying development tools makes it easier for volunteers to identify the content of robotics. At the same time, in order to avoid defamation lawsuits and the risks of violations of copyright, Wikipedia is drafting a policy to limit the use of large language models to volunteers. Come to create Wikipedia content. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-14T03-03-07-00-00/000184301_piclink.jpeg" />In the field of music copyrights, according to the Financial Times reported on May 9, Spotify, the world's largest audio streaming business, recently removed about 7%of the songs uploaded by Boomy because the AIGC explosive development can be generated and immediately generated many music tracks. Online robots can also pretend to be a large number of human audiences to exaggerate the flow of songs and trigger copyright issues.</p>
<p>China ’s content platform has launched representation policies for AIGC in recent months. Comparing the AIGC policy of the three platforms of Douyin, Zhihu, and Baidu Baijia, you can find a few convergence: First, emphasize that the creators themselves should be responsible for the content they are released. The content; the second is that the publisher should take the initiative to add the declaration logo to help users identify which content includes AI auxiliary creations or generated by AI. Zhihu will prohibit the account of the AIGC class content in batches. In addition, on the Douyin and Baidu Baijia platform, the virtual human account must complete the real -name authentication. The platform also hopes to identify and manage AIGC through self -developed tools and communities and users.</p>
<p>AIGC is a huge temptation for the content industry, especially non -traditional media and self -media, and has limited effects on self -discipline and other rhythms. The current relying on the current stage of countries has fallen far behind AIGC technology development.In the end, another social risk brought by AIGC is that as AI generates more and more corpus entering the public field, it will become a material for more large language model training. When AI starts to learn the material generated by itself, whether the regenerative text will pollute the corpus formed by pure humans. This returned to the starting point of Herraley's worry -because language is the cornerstone of civilization. If the cornerstone has moved, can humans expect the evolution of AIGC? Openai has stopped publishing the library information from GPT-4. Should the government and regulators be forcibly requested that the transparency of the large -language model development institution has greatly improved the transparency of the training language library? In the future, different countries and platforms are worthy of attention in this direction, standards, and theoretical trends.</p>

Are these middle class wrong? Why do they make such decisions? What does the trend of returning poverty in the middle class indicate?</p>

<p>Recently, "three killed middle -class" set fire.</p>
<p>The so -called three -piece set is "nearly 10 million mortgages, spouses do not work, and second -born abroad". The original author of this paragraph comes from my friend Zhang Mingyang. For a while, the group mocked the middle class became the most loud one in the new social market.</p>
<p><strong> What did you do wrong in "middle class"? </strong></p>
<p>Explore the three -piece set of death in this legend. Is it really a bad choice for the middle class? At least a few years ago, this choice can actually be said to be relatively rational or even pragmatic.</p>
<p>Let's talk about 10 million housing loans. It sounds like a lot, but if you go to see a house of about 10 million in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, you will find that most of the houses of about 100 square meters, not even a new house, and many are not three rooms. There is a child to have a child, and having two children is cramped. Not to mention, if you want to change the house in the future, taxes and fees basically have to be leaving. In this case, buying a house with the highest ability of your own ability and loan to as many housing loans as possible can be said to be the main way to make rational decisions and get rich. Those who have a burden of millions of mortgages are not good for the annual salary. It is nothing more than choosing the most mainstream principles according to the most mainstream opinions in the past. In all fairness, most people do not choose this passerby, but they have no ability.</p>
<p>Second, the spouse does not work. Thousands of house loans can be loan, and income is naturally the mainstay of the family economy, which also means that 996 and the like are basically standard. Frequent business trips will naturally decrease. At this time, the spouse's full -time family can be said to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Not to mention, this spouse is generally female, even if the starting point is as high as the man, but if there is childbirth, at least one or two years before and after a child, the break in the middle workplace is too long, and the rising speed of the workplace is often limited. The income channel will also be reduced. This is actually one of the core reasons why women in the management. Whether fairness or not, seeing wisdom, but in many families, men and women are automatically formed.</p>
<p>Finally, the second child went abroad. In the past few years, it was not too much to call for a second child to have a second child, nor could they not talk about it, so it is necessary to go all out. The spouse can be described as a rational choice. Even so, do not underestimate the difficulty of raising and chickens and dogs. Not to mention that half of the children in big cities may not be able to enter the narrow door of the college entrance examination. In this case, if you are already a person with a annual salary of one million, how many people can endure to educate chickens and dogs at home, and how many people can accept their children to finally go to technical schools. This is a natural choice to choose to go abroad. With one or two years of annual salary, change to a stable rear, and even change to a child's good future -this choice, is it irrational?</p>
<p>If you are easy to place, how many people can do better by people who are mocking across the network now?</p>
<p><strong> Change of Grand Trends </strong></p>
<p>Looking back, why the three -piece set of three -piece set is so common. The core reason is that three conditions are often locked with each other and it is difficult to isolate. Those who choose three -piece sets of middle -class are often salary of millions of people. This is not uncommon in the prosperity of the big factory in the past few years. Elites in first- and second -tier cities have received this income, which is not outrageous. Based on this income level, many decisions are naturally natural.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of over the past 30 years, it can be said that people who have realized wealth transitions have basically gambled the right trend, and the increasing the chips, the greater the income. The question is, will the trend always be there?</p>
<p>As the manager Drucker said, what is really important is not the trend, but the change of trend. The reason why many people do the wrong way is often because they mistakenly take the moment of the time as a long -term trend. When the trend changes, decision -making also changes accordingly. If leverage is the best strategy in the past, then the future, compression leverage may be the mainstream principle.</p>
<p>So, why did the three -piece set of middle -class settled in the crowd? Without him, the front conditions are gone. In recent years, the annual salary of millions of positions such as iceberg is abundant, and it has disappeared suddenly in front of everyone at a frightened speed. This is a situation that most people have been predicted in the past, which can be said to be the tears of the times.</p>
<p>More importantly, this trend is not just affected the group of middle -class elites. The three -piece set of the middle class is just the beginning. Without gloating or self -righteous, everyone may have their own three -piece suit waiting.</p>
<p><strong> Middle class is Golden Silk </strong></p>
<p>The Chinese people have the dissatisfaction with the name "middle class" and have various malicious rubbing. Seeing various self -media articles returning to poverty, many people read it like a cool text, and generally add a sentence. Is this a middle class?</p>
<p>So, what is middle class? The so -called middle class is a middle -income group, which is the majority of society. There are no less than a hundred standards for middle -class. People who can buy Volkswagen Electric in Russia even have a middle class. People who consume 2 to 20 US dollars per day in other countries are middle -class, and there are middle -class standards based on the median population income.</p>
<p>The middle class is not only a stabilizer in modern society, but also the most sensitive group of social changes. It can be said to be the golden bird of society, and the era when the middle income group moved downward is the era of soft class.</p>
<p>I pointed out in the discussion of the new book "Leaping" of the soft class that if the average daily income is $ 10 ~ 20 to $ 20 in accordance with the mainstream standards of the international community. Similar to this standard, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the standard of China's middle -class income group is that the family has an annual income of more than 100,000 yuan. In this way, the threshold has reached more than 400 million.</p>
<p>In addition to official standards, the people have their own standards. In addition to considering income, the middle class of first -tier cities also requires two houses. According to the housing prices in Beijing and Shanghai, it is the iron rich man. Such a high -level threshold is actually the externalization of group anxiety. The fundamental purpose of all the efforts made by the middle class is that their next generation has the same social status as themselves -the so -called middle -class three -piece set is actually the past. In fact, this is the past. The externalization of expectations is not reasonable.</p>
<p>Today, some people also mention the negative standards. The three -piece set of real middle -class is that there is no loan in the house. In fact, such conditions are by no means accessible, I am afraid that it can be achieved by the accumulation of a generation. There are inextricable operations and calculations behind this. What's more, if the economy continues to decline and the finance continues to be weak, the income in the system will not be able to gradually move down, and it may have to be broken without layoffs and salary reduction.</p>
<p>The reason is that China is still a country with a monthly income of 600 million people. Many of the so -called middle class is actually almost the concept of "rich". Mocile middle class, most of them are the class emotions of Qiu Fu. The problem is that under the "invisible hand", most people are already the community of destiny living in the market, and there are various links in the faint relationship. For example, in the past, even if the large factory had a middle -aged crisis, most of the time had been "optimized", and most of them had earned money for a lifetime. They could leave safely, or investors to prosper the first and secondary markets. Now, the annual salary of one million has been laid off. After finding a circle, half of the salary reduction may not be received. Once hundreds of thousands start rolling, the annual income of 100,000 years will probably not be better. This is a serial effect.</p>

In addition, he was accused of knowing the documents that should be returned in his hands, but refused to deliver, and he lied to investigators and encouraged lawyers to mislead the investigation unit.</p>
<p>"This is a situation where the crime is more serious than the actual crime." Elizabethgoitein, an expert in the Brennan Center for Justice, told Reuters that "if he just neglects his duties, he may fundamentally Will not be prosecuted. "</p>
<p>During the investigation, Trump's lawyer told the Federal Investigation Bureau that they had handed over all confidential documents and were pierced as a lie afterwards. Goyn added that this kind of behavior that hinders justice can be in prison for up to 20 years.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-14T03-16-00Z/65907245_401.jpg" />After leaving the court, Trump went to Miami's famous Cuban restaurant "Versailles" for dinner. There was Sichuan Fan who came to celebrate his birthday at the scene.</p>
<h3>After not pleading guilty, what will happen next?</h3>
<p>After the hearing on the 13th, the case will enter the legal procedure before trial. Reuters analysis that the Trump team may delay time through different means, so the case is likely to officially open after at least one year, that is, it may be dragged until the Presidential election in 2024, and US law has not restricted or was convicted or convicted. The defendant was not allowed to run, so Trump still had a high chance to take the case as usual.</p>
<p>According to the latest polls released by Reuters and IPSOS, Trump is still far ahead of competitors in the Republican nomination of the Presidential Election in 2024; 81%of Republican voters believe that these allegations are for political motivation.</p>
<p>Trump's personal assistant and co -defendant Waltnauta was arrested for assisting Trump's illegal retaining confidential documents. Both were released unconditionally after the court. The judge did not think that the two defendants had risks of absconding, did not offer any exit restrictions on them, nor did they request bail, but they were not allowed to contact the witnesses in this case.</p>

<h3>?</h3>
<p>Reuters analyzed that if Trump won the presidential election in 2024, it may be difficult to advance the legal war. Since the US Department of Justice is an administrative department, and the president is the highest federal law enforcement officials in the country, and federal prosecutors are usually appointed by the president.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice has a decades of policy, that is, the current president will not be prosecuted unless it is approved by the General Admission of the United States (that is, the Minister of Justice) under the "special circumstances".</p>
<p>Although Merrick Garland, the current judicial minister of Biden, may ignore the policy and continue to promote a confidential document case, if Trump has been selected again, he may also dismiss Galan and choose an agent. However, the appointment of permanent successor must still be approved by the US Senate.</p>

This shows that the recent relationship between China and the United States is described as "Spring Blossoms", which may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>"Spring Warm" means that compared with the "balloon incident" in March, high -level contacts and dialogue stops in the two countries have recently restored high -level dialogue.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-14T03-54-44-00-00/000178787_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>China and South Korea's latest diplomatic disputes have witnessed these two neighboring countries. The matter was caused by the Chinese Ambassador to Korea Xing Haiming on June 8th, and Li Zaiming, the leading Democratic Party of South Korea in the Wild Party, was the following words that made the Korean side strong. Interference of external factors. The United States is trying to suppress China, and some people bet that the United States will win and China loses. This is obviously misjudgment. He has not seen the general trend of history. He also said that people who bet on China now will regret it in the future.</p>
<p>According to the exchanges between me and my Korean media, Xing Haiming said that South Korea's betting between the United States and China should lose China. This should not be fake. A Korean friend once bluntly told me that he believed that China and the United States confronted that China would lose. South Korea would change the diplomacy that had a balanced position between the United States and China and joined the United States Sino -China Alliance. This view is quite market in South Korea. Yin Xiyue is also very beautiful. Nevertheless, the fierce response to Xing Haiming's remarks on Xing Haiming still exceeded many Chinese people's expectations. The outside world saw that South Korean Foreign Minister Park Zhen condemned Xing Haiming for his excessive remarks. According to diplomatic practices, the ambassador's score was to enhance the friendship between the two countries, not the misunderstanding of communication. Zhang Huzhen, the first deputy foreign minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, also summoned Xing Haiming on the same day, saying that he in front of many media, condemned the Korean policy with the unspeakable wording and the facts that contrary to the facts. The interference in domestic politics in South Korea violates the Vienna Convention and warns that Xing Haiming should do well in the division, and all the consequences must be borne by me. Zhao Taiyong, the head of the South Korean National Security Office, also said during the day talk about South Korea -China relations that it will pursue diplomacy that conforms to national strength to build a healthy Korean -China relations. Yin Xiyue's government is centered on national interests, based on principles and mutual benefit and equivalent principles, and strives to develop into a global central country that cooperates with the international community.</p>
<p>China's protests and warnings on South Korea naturally did not politely fight back, but tone was not as strong as South Korea. Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nun Rong, saw that the South Korean ambassador to China, Zheng Zaihao, showed "improper reactions" to South Korea's "improper reaction" of Xing Haiming and Lee in the Ming meeting. , Effectively abide by the spirit of the China -Korea Jianjian Communist Party, and go with China. In addition, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin was asked many times at a press conference on June 9th and 12th, expressing the same attitude with Rongrong.</p>
<p>The act of fighting against each other's ambassador to the opponent's ambassador to China and South Korea was the second time after Yin Xiyue's visit to the United States on the United States in April this year, which caused the second time after China ’s solemn negotiations. During the period, not only did not improve, but continued to deteriorate. The two countries have formed the following interactive model: as long as one party publishes or makes the other party's perspective of interference in the internal affairs or unfavorable words and deeds, they will be protested by the other party, and on the other hand, they are not willing to show weakness and protest.</p>
<p>This is actually not the whole of the government. During this period, Liu Jinsong, the director of the Asian Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with relevant officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea in South Korea in May 22, which is particularly worthy of attention. According to Korean media reports, Liu Jinsong conveyed the "four impossible positions" from the Yin Xiyue government to the Yin Xiyue government: if China's core interests are violated, it will not be possible to cooperate with South Korea; if South Korea adopts unilateral pro -American, pro -Japanese foreign policy, It will not cooperate; if the relationship between the two countries is continuously destroyed, China will refuse to conduct high -level exchanges; in the case of deteriorating regional situations, South Korea cannot play an important role in the Peninsula issue. This "four impossible positions" will undoubtedly be regarded by South Korea as a naked threat. If Liu Jinsong's statement is true, this shows that China is very dissatisfied with the Yin Xiyue government, and the two countries are related to a very bad level. To a large extent, this can also explain why Xing Haiming met with Li Zaiming in the face of the reporter. Some Chinese media believed that this was not named Yin Xiyue. This also shows that before South Korea's attitude is changed, China does not intend to take out measures to improve its relations with South Korea.</p>
<p>The rate of bad relations between the two countries is beyond the bad records of China and most Western countries. Even if the confrontation between China and the United States, it has experienced at least one year of observation and repeated development during the Trump period. However It fell to the bottom of the valley one year after taking office. The reason for this is of course there is a problem of China. From the perspective of South Korea, in addition to the previously mentioned Yin Xiyue government gambled in the United States and China, another important factor is the importance of the Chinese market to South Korea to South Korea. It's falling. According to data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Commerce Resources of Korea on June 6, from January to May this year, South Korea's exports to China were US $ 49.7 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 27.3%. Since June last year, South Korea's exports to China have been in a negative growth trend for 12 consecutive months. In the past year, except for September of the year, the rest of the month's trade with China has now been deficit, and China has changed from a maximum country in the past to the largest deficit country. According to data from the South Korean Trade Association, China's share in the total exports of South Korea is also declining, from 25.3%in 2021 to 22.8%last year, and then decreased to 19.5%in the first quarter of this year. The increase of US exports.</p>
<p>Although China is still the largest export market in South Korea, if according to the above trend, in a few years, I am afraid that it will have to be located in the United States. Regardless of this phenomenon, the "de -Chineseization" of South Korea's economy will inevitably reflect the foreign relations between the two countries. Relations should be based on principles and mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Yin Xiyue still has four years. Because South Korea's policy on China has been abducted by the United States, the future progress of Sino -South Korean relations depends on Sino -US relations. However, if there is no special accident, Sino -US relations cannot be substantially eased in the next four years. The competition and confrontation between the two countries will only be further strengthened, and South Korea can only follow the pace of the United States and Japan and the tone processing to deal with China. As Zhao Taiyong said before, he pursued the diplomacy that conforms to South Korea's national strength. This will make the contradiction between the two parties more difficult to solve. At present, China has just tapped in South Korea. It has not taken substantial measures to counter it. If Liu Jinsong said, "Four impossible positions", such as supporting North Korea, and even increasing military assistance to North Korea, it will undoubtedly bring South Korea to South Korea. Great risk, thereby enable the two sides to enter a state of hostility. This should not be seen by China. So at the recent Shangri -La dialogue, the two countries' defense ministers still met. But the future trend is difficult to say. If South Korea introduces the second "Sad" system, or join the US -Japanese Military Alliance to form the "Little NATO" of the Three Kingdoms, it will not rule out that China will do so.</p>
<p>South Korea is ambitious to pursue the center of the global hub, which means that when it conflicts with China, it is unlikely to adopt a compromise. From the last time China and South Korea were interacted with this diplomacy, South Korea did not intend to retreat, and of course China did not intend to show weakness. In addition, the public opinion of the two countries hate each other highly and support the government to hold a strong position on the other party. It is almost certain that during the period of Yin Xiyue, the relationship between the two countries could not improve.</p>

<p>In recent days, many people have paid attention to an international news. On June 9, local time, Colombian President Gustov Petro announced to the media that a small aircraft crashed in the virgin forest, and after 40 days of search and rescue, four missing children have been found together. Except for dehydration, malnutrition, and mosquito bites, they were not injured and survived, including a one -year -old baby.</p>
<p>According to relevant media reports, they originally lived in the local indigenous people living in old forests in the mountains. There are no roads in the local area. Generally, they can only rely on small planes. On the day of the incident, the four children followed their mother and a relative, and took a small aircraft to gather with their father according to the instructions of the distant father. However, the plane crashed while flying over Amazon's virgin forest, and all three adults including aircraft drivers were killed. The remaining 4 children are 13 years old, 9 years old, 4 years old, and 1 year old. Poisonous insects and beasts in the jungle are often heavy rains and have a low visibility. The local indigenous and military started search and rescue at the same time, and they found them 40 days later. While the world was surprised and lamented that these children could survive miraculously, they all attributed their miracles to their survival of their survival skills. People say that they are mainly because they are local indigenous peoples. They have been familiar with the forest since they were young. They know what they can eat and what they can't eat. They understand the jungle, so they can survive.</p>
<p>The four children can survive, and there is a reason that is easy to be ignored by everyone, that is, their inner spiritual power, the kind of toughness, love, unity and responsibility. President Lin Min of Shanghai Western Foreign Language School said in a comment on this incident: "This requires courage, perseverance, tough psychology, optimistic emotion, and good physical fitness. Babies who are less than the age of age are without discarding, how much responsibility and love this takes!"And pointed out that the problems in our current education are" children do not see the storms and do not see the world. It is disconnected from nature and society, clean and pure, and always grows on campuses that adults take care of and care. "Once you are in an accident, you will lack" the quality and ability that can cope with calmness ".</p>
<p>Some of the words of President Lin Min made people feel helpless. After all, parents and schools are afraid of "accidents." This also reminds me of one thing I was when I was a kid. I remember when we were in elementary school, we went to "Spring Tour" every spring every spring. At that time, the conditions were limited, and the students were sitting in a large truck in a short trip. Once, we went to a mountain on the suburbs during the spring tour. Along the way, we sang in the truck's bucket, but when we got out of the car, we were dumbfounded. It turns out that the car and the cars taken by the teachers and the students will drive to two different parking lots in the middle of the mountain. After we got out of the car, we couldn't find the teacher. The driver said that there may be problems with communication and the direction of the wrong direction. At that time, we were a 5th grade student in elementary school, but the driver said that he rushed to pick up another single work. After telling us the general direction of another parking lot, he drove and left himself. There are about 50 or 60 people in our class. In order to find the teacher as soon as possible, we discussed all the staff into three groups and tied the red scarf on the branches as a banner. Then we followed the mountain road towards another parking lot. We almost crossed a hill and finally came to meet our teachers.</p>
<p>I don't know if the teachers at the time were afraid of our hearts. We were a little excited as students. When I was a kid, I almost forgot to do it. Only this spring tour was like a special adventure. It was preserved in memory for decades. Now I think of it still feels a surging feeling. At that time, the cooperation and solidarity between the students, the kind of classmate relationship that did not fall down, seemed to have not faded in the memory of the excitement in the forest. There was another impressive "spring tour" in high school. It was a journey where no teacher participated. We also encountered difficulties and solved it. We can say that fortunately this is some accidents that have not happened. But we can't ignore that similar accidents or adventures bring our character to our character, and the significance of the growth of our soul.</p>
<p>In the international schools in Hong Kong and Singapore, since the first grade of elementary school, there are about one week of each semester. Children need to leave their parents, go to the suburbs with teachers and classmates to camp abroad, including many survival training projects, and there are many fields in the wild. Caves, streaming, mountain climbing and other activities, as well as some local charity assistance projects. These are part of the course. There are no special circumstances, and each child must participate. IB schools can also apply for the international diploma IB organization to apply for various performance certifications according to the performance of students during the camping period. Students can obtain an honorary certificate for IB organization certification. There was a student trembling before the trip, and expressed the emotions that did not want to go or dare to challenge these field projects. After the teacher's counseling many times, he finally made a run, and participated in all the projects. To the "Risktaker" honorary certificate from the IB Diploma organization. Of course, in addition to the teachers to pay a lot, the assistance of professional outdoor activity groups has minimized the risk. But no one can guarantee that these activities are 100 % risk. Parents were told before the trip, but this is part of school education. It is difficult to carry out such educational activities when we excessively avoid risks and over -protect children.</p>
<p>In the Colombian jungle, the father of the children who was rescued said that the 13 -year -old daughter Lesley revealed that their mother lived 4 days after crash before died before she died. Before dying, she said to the children, "You leave here" and "You will see what kind of person you are, and he will show you the same great love to you." These are all the motivation for children to survive themselves. People live in the world and never rely on food alone. The connection between people, the various relationships with our family and around us are all our motivation for our living. Therefore, another revelation I got from this incident is that our education should pay attention to the relationship. This relationship is exposed from inner emotions, not a formal "gratitude education". Shooting a small video to prove that washing your father's feet is the education that focuses on relationships? In addition, we cannot always prove our love by destroying parent -child relationships. For example, so -called for children, they constantly force children to pursue grades. Our adults have the responsibility to think about how we express our love for our children. It is not possible to bring ransom and harm, so that our children can truly learn how to love ourselves, family, and others. The long -lasting love is that when encountering difficulties, accidents, and adversity, people still have the courage to stand up.</p>
<p>In short, our education cannot only pay attention to the knowledge of knowledge, whether it is the knowledge in books, or the knowledge of survival in the wild; there should be more attention to the soul, the spiritual part, the character of the character, and the part of the emotion and social. People cannot rely on food. We must also rely on the pursuit of our hearts, relying on love and responsibility, and relying on the connection between people to better face the adversity of life.</p>

Over the past year, users have poured on Tiktok to tell their stories. They believe that cortisol imbalance has led to a series of health problems -and it is recommended that people who see the video check their cortisol levels.</p>
<p>Cortisol, sometimes called <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22187-cortisol">pressure hormone</a>This chemical substance helps regulate our body's response to stress. "This is a hormone that connects the body and mind," said associate professor of behavioral medical at Columbia University Martin Picad. Almost every organ has a receptor that responds to cortisol. Regardless of whether it is regulating blood pressure or anti -inflammatory, it plays a vital role in our daily body function.</p>
<p>The assistant researcher of the Yale University Pressure Center Nia Fogman said that this does not necessarily mean that all kinds of diseases that people send on Tiktok are because of cortisol imbalance. "People want: 1. Find out what they have happened; 2. I want to solve it by doing something. I think this is natural and understandable," she said. But things are not so simple.</p>

<p>What is the effect of cortisol? **</p>
<p>When we are under pressure, the pituitary gland in the brain -sometimes called <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-pituitary-gland#">main glands</a>——In signals to the adrenal glands above the kidney, prompting them to secrete cortisol and transport them to our blood.</p>
<p>The health psychologist Jennite M. Bened, a health psychologist at the University of North Carolina, studied pressure on health. She said that when we are facing challenges, whether it is psychologically or physical, the reality is imagined. Our body will release this chemical substance. When we encounter obvious threats, for example, when we encounter a bear during hiking, we will release cortisol, but it will also release cortisol when we receive the work email we don't want to see. When we perceive one thing, the more threatened, usually more cortisol. She also said that when researchers are studying cortisol levels, people often take people's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4253051/">public speech</a>As a research tool, any situation that faces us to social evaluation will lead to the rapid rise of cortisol.</p>
<p>"Body and mind will respond, as if we are in the danger of death, and what is actually threatened is our self -awareness," Picard said.</p>
<p>This is a gift brought by evolution: When fighting or escaping danger, cortisol helps us to mobilize the energy we need by improving the glucose content in our blood to a certain extent. It also regulates our metabolism. Dr. Graigari Friegenne, deputy director of Psychiatric Psychiatry and Harvard Medical College of Medicine, said that our cortisol level is fluctuating all day. When we first wake up, we will rise and be the rise. We gradually decline when we fall asleep.</p>
<p>"Cortisol is your friend," Friggine said, "but too much is not good."</p>

<p><strong> What will happen when your cortisol level is high? </strong></p>
<p>When we have proper cortisol balance, we can play the best. "Our body is such a harmonious unit," Figman said. However, chronic pressure will increase our cortisol horizontal baseline over time, leading to a series of consequences. Friggane said that the continuous high level of cortisol may weaken the immune system and increase blood sugar levels and blood pressure. There is also an indispensable connection between cortisol and sleep: we need to reduce the level of hormone to rest. Frieje said that people with high cortisol content are often difficult to fall asleep and sleep unstopically.</p>
<p>Bente said that imbalances can also lead to fatigue and irritability. "This is the difficulty of cortisol," she said. "Because it is a hormone that is very important for daily functions. Even if there is no pressure, the daily rhythm is disrupted at any time, which will cause behavioral problems."</p>
<p>Some mental health diseases, including depression and post -trauma stress disorders -are related to the imbalance of cortisol, Dr. Lazar Sagal Vara, a resident at the Department of Psychiatry, Fandebelt University of Medical Center. He has done the impact of non -drug therapy on cortisol level <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29697709/">Research</a>Essence</p>
<p>In a very few cases, people with too much cortisol will have a series of symptoms, known as Ku Xin syndrome. Patients may produce a group of fat behind the neck; some human weight increases, feel fatigue, and difficult to fall asleep. Some people are prone to bruises, and their blood sugar and blood pressure levels may also rise. Dr. Prateba P. R. Raive, the chief of the Klevelan Clinic's adrenal center, said that people with this disease may need drug treatment or surgery, but the doctor first needs to be diagnosed by a doctor.</p>
<p>If you do not test cortisol levels and consult your doctor, it is almost impossible to determine whether acne or poor sleep have a clear connection with hormonal imbalances -when people do not find any other clear explanations on their health problems, cortisol alcohol is not found, cortisol alcohol It may be just a culprit that is easy to identify. "People will say that their cortisol has risen -I will tell you that you can't feel it," Bernet said. But experts said that if people are really worried about their cortisol level, they can discuss whether they need to test with their general doctors.</p>

<p><strong> Can you measure your cortisol? </strong></p>
<p>Picard said that you can test blood or saliva at a cortisol level at a certain time, but it is unlikely to be particularly useful at a time, because cortisol levels are changing in the day. Urine or hair samples can display cortisol levels for a long time, although the hair samples are mainly used in the research environment.One of the reasons is that the doctor will try to make a comprehensive understanding of your cortisol level, and then judge whether there is a problem. Erbemingte said.</p>
<p>"It is not difficult to detect the level of cortisol, but it is difficult to interpret its meaning," he also said.</p>
<p><strong> Can cortisol levels be reduced? </strong></p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Some small studies have shown that righteous thoughts such as yoga and meditation may help reduce the level of cortisol. Sagalvara said, and even if it takes only five minutes a day to relax itself and restore the mind, it is good. He suggested that the "five senses" exercises allow you to sink your heart when to bear the pressure: list five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two kinds of things that can be heard Things, something you can taste.</p>
<p>Exercise also helps to regulate cortisol. Bente said, especially for physical activity such as jogging or cycling. Such a sports will allow your body to mappore the stress reaction, improve the heart rate, and stop the exercise before lowering the heart rate. This cycle effectively train our body to properly start and close our stress response.</p>
<p>Everyone should find the most suitable way to decompress, Fergman said. For example, some people use a few minutes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/03/well/mind/breathing-exercises.html">square breathing method</a>You can calm down, and some people cannot. Once you find a way to relieve stress, your cortisol level has hopes to become more stable. She also said that this is also applicable to those who have to face huge pressure for a long time.</p>
<p>"Stress is not a problem," Friggine said. "As long as it is a life body, there will be pressure."</p>

<h1>What does Trump want to turn the United States?</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-14T06-01-59-08-00/13friedman-image-kcgf-master1050.jpg" />At the end of the Senate condemning Donald Trump to the fierce speech on January 6, if Mickey McConal promised to take a moment to ensure that Trump was sentenced to establishing an impeachment, and it was established to be established, and and the establishment of impeachment and. Never become president again, what will happen?</p>
<p>Daniels, a porn star "Blizzard", said that Trump had a son with her son in Marania less than four months after she gave birth to her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/stormy-daniels-trump-stephanie-clifford-sharks">sexual relationship without protection measures</a>Later, if Marania Trump threw all Trump's clothes, golf clubs, Maga hats and hair gums on the White House lawn, and put a note, "Never come back, you are despicable Perverted!"What will happen?</p>
<p>In Trump, he was arrested as a TV star, and he had the right to "catch" the most private part of a woman -or after a jury in Manhattan found that Trump did almost the same thing to Gihn Coroel ——If the famous gospel leader Robert Jeffers claims that he will lead a campaign to ensure that Trump will never be elected president in 2024, because Trump is a loss, Jeffis will never let him look at it. Not to mention this country. If so, what will happen?</p>
<p>Such remarks and actions will make Kevin McCarthy, those stupid guys in the core group of the Republican Republican Party, and other Republicans who are defending Trump and opposing the Ministry of Justice? If so, would they still be so eager to declare that Trump is innocent? Will they still be angry about the hearing held on Miami on Tuesday? Will they still mistakenly claim that President Biden is suing Trump -in fact, they know that the president has no power to prosecute anyone.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>I wonder. But I know that all these questions are instead. None of these people have the ability to face these moral challenges, challenge Trump and his behavior of destroying our political system. Trump is like a drug dealer who has a prosperous business in the ruined neighborhood, which makes everyone fascinate his distorted values. Because of this, he is extremely able to destroy the unity of our country from two basic aspects.</p>
<p>First of all, Trump has always tried to slander those who show character and courage, and label them to the losers and the weak. This is easy for Trump, because he is a person who has no reputation at all -no morality, not loyal to any value system, or anyone other than him. For him, politics is a bloody movement. You use defamation, nickname and lies to fight against other men and women -whether they belong to your party or not -until they cannot hinder you.</p>
<p>Trump used this strategy in John McCain for a long time -a veteran, a person who has never collapsed by more than five prisoners of war in North Vietnam, a truly character. Remember on July 18, 2015, Trump at the family leadership summit held by Emus, Aiwa, to McCain <a href="https://eu.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/08/president-donald-trump-john-mccain-loser-fact-check/5741070002/">How to comment</a>?</p>
<p>When McCain was running for the president, Trump said to the audience, "I have supported him." "He lost. He disappointed us. But he lost. So since then, I don’t like him Because I don't like the loser. "When the audience laughed, the host and poll expert Frank Lenz intervened:" But he is a war hero!"</p>
<p>Then, during the Vietnam War, Trump responded to Trump, who had a suspicious medical suspension in order to avoid being recruited. "Later that day, Trump turned on a post on Twitter, the title" Donald Trump: John McCain is a 'loser' ".</p>
<p>Therefore, Trump tried to break our system, part of the quality by redefining what leaders should have -at least in the Republican Party. Leaders are not people like Liz Chenney or Mitt Romney. They are willing to set their own political future to defend the truth, serve the country and maintain the constitution. No, the leader is a person like him, a person who is willing to win at all costs, these costs include the country, the constitution, and the example for us for our descendants and allies.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>When you define leadership and victory like this, people like McCain, Chenney, and Romney will block your way. You need to deprive everyone of everyone around you and turn everything into ensuring power and money. That's why so many people around Trump have left since 2015. None of them are clean. The same reason made me know that what I asked before was a question.</p>
<p>In Miami on Tuesday, Trump asked us to see the second way of trying to destroy our system. He appeared as a federal criminal defendant in a Cuban restaurant and held a political meeting. There, Trump tried to slander the rules of the game again, which limited the unlimited desires of him and his power for power itself.</p>
<p>How did he do that? First of all, he asked everyone around the surrounding people to let most of his political parties -stop insisting on asking Trump to abide by moral norms. His family and colleagues in the party were accustomed to escaping the microphone of the reporter after each Trump atrocked.</p>
<p>But it is precisely because the main political allies, church leaders and close family members will not blame Trump to violate morality and law -these behaviors make people unable to imagine that he participated in the campaign in 2024 and made him leave politics faster. Stage -we must rely entirely on the court to defend the rules of the game.</p>
<p>When this happens, it will put tremendous pressure on our judicial system and our democracy itself, because the decision of prosecution or non -prosecution must always be judged. When these judgments are sometimes made by the judges or prosecutors appointed by the Democratic Party -this is the way our system operates -this gives Trump and his followers a perfect opportunity to condemn the entire process. persecution".</p>
<p>When this behavior happened over and over again on the extensive front -because no matter where, Trump would not stop because of the red light, but kept provoking us. The illegal act is still suing him. If he sue him, you can shout prejudice -we will eventually erode the two most important pillars' belief in our democratic system: believe that our judicial independence can ensure that no one can override the law. And believe that we have the ability to transfer power peacefully.</p>
<p>advertise"Isn't it better to tell them directly here?"</p>
<p>Who is better for? only one person. That's why I want to say it again: Trump makes us in this situation. He actually wants to break our system, because he and people like him can only get water in the collapse system.</p>
<p>Therefore, he has been promoting the critical point of our system to collapse -at this moment, the fool talks about the rules, and the fool talks about the specifications. The basic truth can be changed. Men and women with noble character are excluded.</p>
<p>This is what the quasi -dictator tries to do: use lies to submerge this place so that people only believe in them, and the truth is only what they say.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous moment for our country, no matter how emphasized it is.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The sketch of the court showed that in the Miami court, Trump was wearing a blue suit, and his lawyer Chriskis and Todbram were on both sides.</p>
<p><strong> Former US President Trump was accused of illegally preserving confidential documents after leaving the White House, becoming the first former US former US or President in history. </strong></p>
<p>He faced 37 charges, including hindering the actions of the government's retrieved documents, but he had denied the court.</p>
<p>Trump has performed in court, and the prosecutor is now promoting to accelerate the interrogation.</p>
<p>The BBC Washington Branch reported that Trump had no expression when he appeared in court, and kept silent. After leaving, he went to a golf club in New Jersey to speak to his supporters.</p>
<p>The Republicans told supporters that he "fully had the right" to save relevant documents, but admitted that he had not read all documents.</p>
<p>After that, he made a series of unsatisfactory allegations and criticized President Biden and his former political opponent Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Legal experts pointed out that Trump may try to delay the interrogation as possible.</p>
<p>"He has sufficient motivation to delay," said Carltobias, a legal professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. He pointed out that Trump is conducting a campaign to seek nominations for the Republican presidential candidate and strive to enter the White House again in 2024.</p>
<p>Trump's hearing on Miami on Tuesday (June 13) was a standard program. He was recorded in the case, fingerprints, and collected DNA samples, and later he denied the crime.</p>
<p>He was allowed to leave the court, and because he was protected by the SARs and was not regarded as a risk of escape, there was no such restrictions in the bail.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump supporters had a mouthful with his opponent outside the court</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65035373">The four major legal issues in front of Trump</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65184982">Trump's trial, what is his "thirty -four sins"? </a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65865840">Trump was again criminal prosecution: Will he be imprisoned for 37 sins? </a>The next step will be a security permit for Trump's lawyers because the case involves high confidential documents. The legal professor of law and former federal prosecutor Kevin Mcmunigal, a legal professor at Case Western Reserveunivers, said: "This takes time."</p>
<p>Prior to this, Trump first established his legal team in Florida. Two of his lawyers James Trusty and Johnrowley resigned on Friday, that is, he resigned one day after his prosecution.</p>
<p>Former President Trump ’s representative lawyer when he went to court on Tuesday was Todd Blanche, but experts pointed out that he might try to join other lawyers who practiced in the state.</p>
<p>At the same time, the court will enter the next step to select the jury in this case.</p>
<p>Mc Munican said that federal trials are often very rapid, and most of the defendants of cases will be tried within 90 days after the hearing. However, Trump's case may be an exception, because it is a well -known case that requires a security permit.</p>
<p>Legal experts still believe that the allegations of the former president are "surprisingly powerful", and any efforts trying to revoke the case are likely to fail.</p>
<p>"This is not to say that he and his lawyer will not delay as much as possible," Professor Tobiaz said.</p>
<p>They may hinder case advancement through the following three methods.</p>
<h3>1 . Called no criminal crimes</h3>
<p>Trump repeatedly argued that he had the right to take away documents from the White House under the Presidential Records Act, and he had decrypted it before his departure.</p>
<p>His lawyer may put this argument in front of the court, but Professor Tobiaz said that this approach is unlikely to obtain a favorable ruling.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>On the day of Trump's court, law enforcement officers were alerting outside the court.</p>
<p>"I don't think he no longer has the right to retain documents after the president," said Professor Tobiaz. "The" Archive Law "is very clear. I don't think there is any doubt about it."</p>
<h3>2 . Claim that he has suffered unfairly</h3>
<p>His lawyers may also argue that Trump is the victim of "selective prosecution" -he is under unfairly targeted, and other politicians, such as HillaryClinton, Mike Pence, And President Joe Biden and others have never been prosecuted for their processing of confidential documents.</p>

<p>The supporters of former US President Trump gathered near the entrance to the Golf Course of the Dorra.</p>
<p>But Professor Tobiaz said that the case of former President Trump is different in several aspects. First, several other politicians were "very willing" to pay back the documents they had preserved at the time, but the evidence in the indictment showed that Trump refused to do so.</p>
<p>"The indictment shows that Trump has been accused of doing a lot of very irresponsible things," he said, the remarks of selective prosecution not far before the court.</p>
<h3>3 . Try to overthrow key evidenceProfessor Mc Monica said: "That may be a question before the interrogation, which will cause some delays."</h3>
<p>However, he added that the judge in the case of the trial of Washington had ruled that under the principle of Crime-Fraudexception, the evidence could be included in the indictment. This exceptional principle applies to the dialogue between lawyers and customers trying to obtain legal proposal on how to perform fraud or crimes.</p>
<p>Experts say that even if these reasons are unlikely to completely overthrow the case, it will definitely cause some delay, because the court will have to carefully measure the issues raised by Lawyer Trump one by one.</p>

<h3>The support of the Republican Party is not affected</h3>
<p>Trump was involved in a lawsuit, and it seemed that his support among Republicans had declined.</p>
<p>BBC's partner Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) found that 76%of Republican's major voters are even more worried that the lawsuit is political motivation, not whether documents may endanger national security.</p>
<p>Program, the operation of the US Department of Justice should be independent of the White House. Biden himself was also undergoing another investigation because of the processing of confidential documents. He said last week: "I never -have never -it is recommended to do what the judicial department should do."</p>
<p>Legal experts said that criminal criminal prosecution may make Trump prison for a considerable period of time. But he has claimed that no matter what the decision is, he will continue to run for president.</p>
<p>Trump appeared in court this time for less than three months. He accepted a court hearing in New York in April, and he was charged with the 2016 presidential election to falsify business documents with the sealing fee of porn women.</p>

<p>In March of this year, Putin announced that he agreed to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus and pointed out that the United States has deployed such weapons in many European countries in the past few decades.</p>
<p>The United States has a criticism of this and emphasizes the United States' intention to change its position on strategic nuclear weapons. The United States also said that no signs have seen Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In an interview with Russian state -owned television stations, Lukashenko said that Belarus has many nuclear storage facilities left over during the Soviet Union, which has now restored 5 or 6 of them.</p>

<p>In court, Trump was sitting on a dark suit, a red tie, and a cross with both hands. The law and order judge responsible for supervising the hearing briefly described the content of the indictment. One of Trump's lawyers answered.</p>
<p>"We will definitely ask for innocence," he said.</p>
<p>For nearly two and a half years after leaving the White House, Trump was impeached twice. He was accused in another case in New York, and he still had a survey he did after the loss of the 2020 election. Today, as a leader nominated by the Republican presidential candidate in 2024, he is also facing 37 allegations that special prosecutor Jack Smith has proposed to him on the "File Gate".</p>
<p>Trump's personal assistant Walter Norto was charged with the investigators to lie and conspired with Trump to conceal the boxes with confidential documents to the Federal Investigation Agency and the Federal Prosecutor. He also appeared in court that day, but did not make a statement about plea. Norto's lawyer asked for two weeks.</p>
<p>Public security judges who supervise hearing ordered Trump not to discuss the case with Naota or any witness -this is a common restriction in criminal cases. The judge said he understood that the two had to communicate every day because of their work, but said that anything related to the case must be through their lawyers.</p>
<p>Trump was represented by the former Florida Chief Attorney General Christopher M. Kiski and famous defense lawyer Branci in the court on Tuesday. His legal team has been changing. The other two lawyers who represented him resigned shortly after the prosecution was announced.</p>
<p>Special prosecutor Smith also attended the hearing.</p>
<p>After leaving the court, Trump stopped briefly at the famous Versailles Palace in Miami and paid attention to a group of supporters. He plans to return to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey and issue a statement on Tuesday evening.</p>

He said that China has always followed the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation.</p>
<p>According to a notice issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Qin Gang "clarified the strict position" on the core concerns of the Chinese issue such as Taiwan, and emphasized that "the United States should respect, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop harming the interests of China's sovereign security development in the name of competition."</p>

<p>That may be his lowest point.</p>
<p>But in the past few years, Crown Muhammad has restored most of his reputation with the help of his country's considerable wealth and influence.</p>

<p>He had crowded his opponents in the early days of power and consolidated his control over domestic. The social change he promoted, such as allowing women to drive, expanding people's entertainment choices in this country that once banned cinemas, etc., and won fans in Saudi young people.</p>
<p>He also knows that he can make long -term plans as the crown prince of the monarchy. He never needs to be re -elected. He has already dealt with the three US presidents, and he will experience several US presidents in the future, and he will always have power.</p>
<p>He finally recovered this incident from the Kashuji incident that Qian was doing well, and no matter how human rights were talked about, other interests were ultimately priority.</p>
<p>"Bay Arab countries think this is a joke," said the International Crisis Organization Middle East and North Africa Senior Advisor Dina Esanadiali when talking about human rights issues. "They do know their value to the Western world as a partner, as an energy producer, and a country with economic strength, so they said,‘ we can deal with this empty threat because it is only part of the relationship. ’”</p>
<p>After Kashuji was killed, Trump, then President of the United States, once firmly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/trump-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html">defended Crown Mohammed</a>Called Saudi Arabia's arms procurement is good for the United States.</p>

<p>Senator from South Carolina, Graham, said after Kashuji was killed that Crown Mohammed Prince was not suitable for leading the country. But when he visited Saudi Arabia in April this year, Graham praised him. At that time, Graham thanked Saudi Arabia for buying American jet aircraft.</p>
<p>"You have purchased a $ 37 billion aircraft, which are manufactured in my state and my country. I think there are more in the future," Graham <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2288386/saudi-arabia">Al Arabiya TV station on Saudi Arabia</a>explain. "Therefore, as a US senator, I reserved the right to change their views."</p>

<p>The government of Turkish President Rejuepapap Erdogan leaked the details of Kashuji's killing to weaken the image of Mohammed's prince, but eventually put his dissatisfaction with the matter. Last year, a Turkish court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/middleeast/khashoggi-murder-trial-turkey-saudi-arabia.html">handed over to the case of killing Kashuji's murderer</a>Saudi Arabia ended the final case of accountability for crime. Soon after, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia helped support Turkey's finances to deposit $ 5 billion into the Central Bank of Turkey.</p>
<p>PGA has also made similar large changes.</p>
<p>In the past few months, Monasham Chairman of the American Professional Golf Tour has been criticizing Saudi Arabia, and even asked the players who considers the tour of the competitive relationship with PGA: "You have had to apologize for participating in the PGA Tour. ?"</p>
<p>In recent years, many factors affecting the decisions of Muhammad's princes are that more and more people in Saudi Arabia believe that the United States is no longer a reliable partner.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-14T10-57-08-08-00/10saudi-evolution-5-vwqz-master1050.jpg" />The PGA Tour and the Liv Golf League supported by Saudi Arabia reached an accident agreement, highlighting the power of money and influence of the Saudi kingdom on overcoming human rights issues. Doug Mills/The New Yorktimes</p>
<p>Crown Prince Muhammad has dealt with three US presidents from the Democratic and Republican Party, and these presidents want to reduce the participation of the United States in the Middle East. For Saudi Arabia, the risk of retreating in the United States became obvious in 2019. At that time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-refineries-drone-attack.html">Saudi oil facilities</a>It was attacked by drones and missiles, resulting in the suspension of about half of the country's output, and the United States accused Iran of planning to plan attacks.</p>
<p>President Trump refused to make a direct response, which made the leaders of Crown Muhammad and the leaders of the United Arab Emirates concluded that the United States no longer supports them, and they must pay attention to their national security.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"Now, an idea has been deeply engraved in their hearts:‘ We ca n’t expect Washington to protect us, so we must protect ourselves ’," said Estandiali, an international crisis organization. "This has caused them to adjust some aspects of foreign policy."</p>
<p>This also reduces the possibility of Saudi Arabia that promises the United States without thinking.</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine, Muhammad's Crown Prince not only refused to join the Western sanctions of President Putin, but later increased the import of Russian oil products that were lowered.</p>
<p>After Biden met with Crown Prince Mohammed in Saudi Arabia last July, the US government asked Saudi Arabia to hold oil output to help the United States reduce the price of domestic natural gas before the mid -November election. However, last October, Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with other member states organized by the Oil output country, known as "OPEC+" to reduce oil production in order to maintain the rise in oil prices.</p>
<p>This angered Biden, and the White House officials accused Saudi Arabia for violation of the agreement. A few months later, when the demand for oil was indeed reduced, Saudi Arabia insisted that they had the right way to resist political pressure and reduced production.</p>
<p>The "consequences" of Biden's threats have never been fulfilled, which clearly shows that even the United States believes that the economic relationship with Saudi Arabia is very important and cannot be interrupted.</p>

<p>In recent years, the crown prince has established a relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and entertained the latter at the China -A -Summit in December 2022. At that meeting, the two leaders discussed China's role in reducing Saudi Saudi conflict with Iran.</p>
<p>A few months later, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran achieved surprising diplomatic breakthroughs.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-reestablish-ties.html)Essence</p>
<p>This is a stone and two birds for Crown Prince Muhammad. By reaching an agreement, he not only reduced the possibility of conflicting conflicts with his main region, but also allowed world powers outside the United States to obtain major benefits in the reach of the agreement.</p>
<p>Saudi officials have stated that they are more willing to use the United States as the main ally, but the lack of the United States promised means that they need to expand the scope of the ally. And due to the tight relations with Tehran itself, the United States cannot promote Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.</p>

<p>Description: Yellen said that the United States only wanted to "reduce" the risk of relations between the two countries and did not intend to cause economic damage to China. However, she also proposed the differences that may occur with Chinese officials, including additional sanctions on China due to Xinjiang issues. Kenny Holston/The New York Times Treasury Minister Yellen testified in Congress Mountain on Tuesday.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-14T10-58-55-08-00/dc-yellen-china-lwvk-master1050.jpg" />US Treasury Secretary Yellen said on Tuesday that the United States tried to "decoupling" with China would be a mistake and called for deepening the economic connection between the world's two major economies.</p>
<p>At the time of publishing the above comments, the Bayeng government has been seeking to improve relations with China, but this year, a Chinese monitoring balloon flying over the United States was discovered and this effort was frustrated. Secretary of State Brillings <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230612/china-spy-base-cuba/">plans to go to Beijing next week</a>Yelun also hopes to visit China as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yelun on Tuesday at the <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408850">Hearing of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee</a>It is clear that she believes that the economic relationship with China is very important.</p>
<p>"I think we and China can benefit from the open trade and investment as much as possible. If we try to decompose with China, it will be disastrous," Yellen said.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The United States maintains the Trump administration's tariffs on imported products worth billions of dollars in China, and the Bayeng government is formulating new measures to restrict US companies' investment methods in China. But Yellen said that the United States just wanted to "risk risks" and did not intend to cause economic damage to China.</p>
<p>"Of course I don't think that the economic development of the Chinese people is in line with our interests," Yellen said. "China has successfully removed hundreds of millions of people get rid of poverty. I think this is something we should praise."</p>
<p>Although Yellen's wording is mild, she also puts forward concerns that may occur with relevant Chinese officials.</p>
<p>She said that for national security considerations, the government is considering restricting Chinese companies that US private equity companies invest in connect with the Chinese military. She also said that the Ministry of Finance is considering an additional sanctions on China to respond to the violations of Xinjiang Uighurs in human rights.</p>
<p>In recent months, the United States has been increasing pressure on China, asking it to reduce the debt of Zambia and other developing countries. Yellen lamented that although there were signs that China was willing to cooperate and help poor countries avoid breach of contract, it was not enough. She emphasized that the most vulnerable economy is increasingly required by international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>"These institutions reflect the values of the United States," said Yellen. "It can be used as an opaque and unsustainable loan from the weights and balances from China and other countries."</p>
<p>When asked about Yellen's comment on Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin opposed IMF or the World Bank aimed at promoting US interests.</p>
<p>"The International Monetary Fund is not the 'US International Monetary Fund', and the World Bank is not 'World Bank'." He said.</p>

<p>The two -day monetary policy conference on the Federal Reserve officially started on Tuesday (June 13) local time. As U.S. inflation slows down, analysts expect the Fed to be motionless after the end of the meeting and announce the suspension of interest rate hikes, but it still retains the option to raise interest rates again in July or September.</p>
<p>Liao Yuming, a strategist at Star Fair, believes that the latest inflation data in the United States is enough to allow the Federal Reserve to suspend interest rate hikes. Essence</p>
<p>However, in the latest report, he emphasized that this will be "a suspension of raising interest rate hikes with an eagle tendency", because the Fed still emphasized that the interest rate hike cycle may not end, and whether the authorities will turn to the next economic data.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve will hold a monetary policy conference for two consecutive days from June 13. The authorities will announce interest rate decisions and economic outlook in the early morning of Singapore on Thursday (15th). Fed Chairman Powell will subsequently hold a press conference.</p>
<p>Powell has stated that the Fed's leadership would rather wait to evaluate the impact of interest rate hikes on the economy in the past and the recent impact of some bank closures on credit conditions. In the case where inflation is still significantly higher than the goal of more than twice, the Fed may emphasize that it will be retained in July or September options.</p>
<p>According to the latest data released by the US Labor Statistics, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) in May increased by 4%year -on -year, at the lowest level in two years, but still significantly higher than the Fed's target 2%. Based on the price of gasoline, the overall CPI increased by 0.1%month -on -month.</p>
<p>Deanmaki, chief economist at hedge fund Point72 Asset Management Company, told Bloomberg that for Powell, this will be one of the more difficult press conferences. A reasonable high.</p>

<p>Mongolian rights defenders living in Japan Kubess told the station about the approximate situation on Tuesday evening. He said: On June 12, a Mongolian herdsman had occurred in the town of Arigonuyan, Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia. The reason for the incident was that the town's breeding farm leadership team did not negotiate and agree with herders, and unilaterally sold the grassland to the Han people. When these Han people who claimed to have bought the pasture were forcibly entering the pasture, the herdsmen opposed it and were severely injured by the buyer's use of heavy machines. "</p>
<p>On -site videos showed that a yellow bulldozer rushed away from the crowd, hit a number of motorcycles in front, and the people riding on a motorcycle hurriedly abandoned the car and escaped. The bulldozer stopped, more than ten people stepped forward to surround the injured herdsmen, and called the first aid vehicle to send the wounded to the hospital.</p>

<p>According to herdsmen, the town -owned livestock venues belonging to the collective ownership will transfer one of the grass fields to the Han businessmen of the Mainland for a price of 2 million yuan, but they are strongly opposed by herders. The reporter from this station called two local herders for two consecutive days on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the other party never answered the phone.</p>
<p>The reporter called the government officials of the Town of Arv Kundu, and the other party did not deny the incident and asked the reporter to inquire with the town's propaganda department, but refused to provide relevant telephones:</p>
<p>Reporter: "How is the shepherd who was injured by the bulldozer now?</p>
<p>Official: "I don't know, you go to ask for publicity"</p>
<p>Reporter: Did you go to the scene? Are you dealing with this?</p>
<p>The other party hung up the phone immediately, and the reporter turned to the Arvinukun Police Station inquiries, but no one answered the phone.</p>
<p>Xi Haiming, chairman of the Overseas "South Mongolia Hulk" organization, told this station that Inner Mongolia herders have had many disputes with the government to protect the grassland, including causing large -scale protests. Essence He said that heavy vehicles driving on the grass field can cause decades of grass: "This is a great harm for the Mongolian pastoral people. They said that the Mongolians who killed the Mongolians would not give a compensation of hundreds of thousands of yuan. At that time ( Mo Rigen was crushed) Mongolians were angry. Today, the report reported today has been constantly happening one after another. Degenerate, even sandy. "** Mongolians have been banned for thousands of years of sheep for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Xi Haiming said that the Mongolians had thousands of years of grazing history on that land, but was banned by the authorities. In recent years, the authorities raised pigs in Daxing, Inner Mongolia, and a large amount of sewage infiltrated into the ground, which severely polluted the grass field.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2016, for more than ten years, the Huo Lin River Aluminum Factory, adjacent to the town of Arigon, continued to discharge poisonous water and poisonous gas pollution around the environment, which led to a large number of cattle and sheep raised by herders and died. Hundreds of herdsmen gathered in the town of Arvin Kunyan to go to the Holin River Aluminum Factory, asking the plant to stop pollution immediately. The demonstration was immediately intercepted and suppressed by a large number of police officers. On April 11, more than a hundred herdsmen went to the flag government to protest.</p>

<p>China Viewing Taiwan Bay is part of its territory and never promises that it will not be put into force when solving the Taiwan problem. Taiwan resolutely opposes the sovereignty's demands proposed by China, and believes that only the people of Taiwan have the right to determine the future of Taiwan. Wu Zhaozheng said that the lesson of Ukraine was invaded by Russia, and Taiwan should strengthen its resistance to PRC. In his speech, Wu Zhaozheng used the Chinese official name "People's Republic of China".)Essence</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozheng said: "For many observers in the world, (the Chinese army) attack on Taiwan is not imminent or inevitable. Taiwan and its allies are trying to avoid war. The strategy of 'unsatisfactory soldiers' soldiers'. At the moment we are discussing now, the People's Republic of China is showing off a large number of warships and military planes to the Taiwan Strait Middle Line. "</p>
<p>Except for the Vatican, Taiwan has no formal diplomatic relations in Europe. However, Taiwan has a wide -format bilateral relationship with many European countries. Especially after the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, although Beijing expressed strong dissatisfaction, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/赴台立法院演说-捷克议长与台湾同舟共济/a-65133024">but many Central and Eastern European countries have further strengthened their support for Taiwan to help Taiwan get rid of the international loneliness</a>stand.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-14T11-18-00Z/65145279_401.jpg" />In March of this year, Ada Mowa, Speaker of the Czech House of Representatives, led a large representative to visit Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan Foreign Minister Wu Zhaozheng delivered the above speeches at a meeting held in a think tank in Prague.

<p>Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager. Some workers sent a confrontation scene in Douyin <a href="https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA1p7MwZLcIxN-nQUiu8yogLIDKf2PS7Cxw7e6pYJABIY?modal_id=7228898852244376847&amp;relation=0&amp;vid=7228898852244376847">Video</a>Essence</p>
<p>Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.</p>
<p>Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to the 361 of the Wuli Industrial Zone was also. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation book, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?</p>
<p>It should be asked why!</p>
<p>Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?</p>
<p>As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. <a href="http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm">Company Branch Committee</a>". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.</p>
<p>In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?</p>
<p>With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.</p>
<p>It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor <a href="https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html">Xi Jinping once scolded</a>Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".</p>
<p>What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?</p>
<p>On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.</p>
<p>However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.</p>
<p>According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.</p>
<p>So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?It seems that the people who may be responsible for the release of China Industry.com are precisely some people who are "mediocre and peaceful stalls, peaceful peace, and mixed days." These people only care about publication, and do not care about the lack of missing missions in the living incidents such as Jiaxinguan Plant. They do not care whether the exaggerated achievements have happened in the reports issued.</p>
<p>Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[<a href="http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html">Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality</a>"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.</p>
<p>In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".</p>
<p>In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.</p>
<p>The good situation of enterprises ".</p>
<p>The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".</p>
<p>For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.</p>
<p>The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.</p>

<p>Lawyer Wang Quanzhang, who also faced the pressure of the Beijing authorities, has been living in a certain place since April. In order to escape the monitoring of the authorities, he and his wife and children moved into Changping's new residence in a low posture, and the final whereabouts failed to keep secret.</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang: "The people of Shunyi's police and security companies tracked our new residence and reported the police station in the jurisdiction. Our difficulties are that in the process of looking for a new house, the people of these police and security companies of Shunyi have been Following us, the police said that we've illegally invaded others 'homes'. After the Internet disclosure, the police harassment was gone, but the local security guards they arranged were still watching us under the building. "</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang said that they only wanted to live a stable life in Beijing, but it seems that after the past, they will continue to encounter new challenges.</p>
<p>Wang Quanzhang: "They are studying all kinds of methods. Not only our families, many Christians' families are persecuted and expelled. If we want to be stable, it is very difficult to live."</p>
<p>In recent months, the Beijing authorities have further strengthened stability, and the victims of the 709 case have become the key to suppress the target. Wang Qiaoling, a family member of the 709 case, said that the means adopted by the authorities could not be ignored, and it would only cause anti -effects.</p>
<p>Wang Qiaoling: "Because everyone is paying attention, paying attention to a lawyer can not be treated in accordance with legal procedures. What about you? Li Heping's influence will be gone because of being out of Beijing? Not very smart, not very wise, and stupid in a sense. "</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that many disagreements that have attracted much attention from the outside world are based on Beijing, and the authorities may believe that they drive them one by one to the outside world, enough to destroy the cohesion of rights protection.</p>

<p>Goldmansachs economists wrote in a recent report to customers that the leadership of the Federal Preparatory Council (FED) has released a message that suspending interest rate hikes is a cautious approach, because the lagging effect of hikes and banks Credit tightening causes the uncertainty caused by the two factors, increasing the risk of overly tightening unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Although the inflation rate is still higher than the 2%long -term target of the Federal Reserve, it has slowed down in recent months, which has led to some federal public market committees to call for a suspension of interest rate hike today.</p>
<p>The Fed's director of the Fed, Philipjefferson, said at the end of last month: "Skipping interest rates at the upcoming meeting will allow the Federal Public Marketing Committee to see more data, and then decide the degree of additional tightening policy."</p>
<p>Jefferson, who is about to be promoted to the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, pointed out that this approach "should not be interpreted as the highest interest rate for us that we have reached the (interest rate hike) cycle."</p>
<p>Since the Federal Statistics began to raise interest rates in March 2022, it has increased the benchmark lending interest rate by 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Since then, inflation seems to have reached a high point, and the economy has shown signs of slowing down, although the labor market still maintains amazing toughness. (Translator: Lin Yifeng/Calculating Draft: Lin Zhiping)</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany in Chinese) The Chinese Navy training ship "Qi Jiguang" arrived on Wednesday (June 14) to the Philippine capital Manila, which was equipped with 476 naval students and officers and soldiers on the ship.

<p>In February of this year, the Chinese Maritime Police Ship used the "military -level laser" near the islands and reefs with sovereignty disputes to illuminate a Philippine ship, which caused some crew members to be briefly blind.

<h3>Visit Qi Jiguang Ship in the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Biden government has been committed to strengthening the Indo -Pacific region to compete for China's extensive ocean claims, including a threat to democratic Taiwan.</p>
<p>Qi Jiguang, the largest training ship of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, will stay at the Philippine port until June 17. This is the last stop for the ship to sail in the past 40.</p>
<p>When the Qi Jiguang ship launched from Dalian, Liaoning in mid -May, the Chinese official media did not mention <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中菲承诺深化关系-马尼拉-不只着眼于南海分歧/a-65405915">various territorial disputes involved in China in China</a>It only reported that Qi Jiguang performed internship access mission in the sea area. This is the opportunity to visit foreign warships, colleges and training facilities to visit foreign warships, colleges and training facilities.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that only members of the China -Philippine community were allowed to board the Qi Jiguang ship on Wednesday, but it will be open to more people on Thursday and Friday.</p>

The statement pointed out that during Beijing, Secretary of State Brillin will meet with senior Chinese officials to discuss the importance of maintaining open communication channels to manage US -China relations responsibly. He will also ask bilateral concerns, global and regional affairs, and potential cooperation in dealing with common multinational challenges. However, the United States does not provide more details of the schedule.</p>
<p>Chinese official media CCTV News said in the newspaper on the evening of the 14th that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin announced that with the agreed of China and the United States, U.S. Secretary of State Brillin will visit China from June 18th to 19th. However, earlier, when Wang Wenbin answered related questions at the regular press conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day, he still said that the interview was, "there is no news that can be provided."</p>
<p>Kurt Campbell, coordinator of the White House National Security Society, and Daniel J.kritenbrink, Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, discussed the upcoming visits of Broncane at the media telephone briefing on Wednesday morning. Among them, Kangda pointed out that Brinken has three major goals to visit China, that is, he hopes to ensure the smooth communication channels of high -level communication to reduce the risk of misjudgment; at the same time, express and defend the interests and values of the United States; and seek potential cooperation in the interests of each other.</p>
<p>Kangda emphasized that the United States hopes to conduct "frank, direct and constructive discussions" and "substantial dialogue" with China, so as to be able to manage the competition between the two countries responsible. But he did not expect the talks to have the results of "breakthrough or transition" and delivery. He said: "We came to Beijing with a realistic, confident attitude and sincere desire to manage our competition in a responsible way."</p>
<p>Blingken visits China and is expected to meet with senior Chinese officials such as Qin Gang, and may also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But at the briefing, neither Kangda nor Campbell revealed the specific schedule of Brinken.</p>
<p>Regarding what Brings can do this time in China to control the tensions on both sides of the strait, Kangda responded that cross -strait issues have always been one of the most important, challenging and most sensitive issues between the United States and China. It is expected that Brinton will reiterate that maintaining the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is the lasting interests of the United States. The two sides will also discuss Ukraine issues.</p>
<p>A worry -free aspect of relations between the two countries is military dialogue. Campbell said: "I believe that the Secretary of State Brillin will strongly advocate these communication channels. They are mature and powerful military interaction methods, and the risk of avoiding these key communication channels is too high."</p>
<p>Campbell also emphasized that the United States is competing with China, but the United States does not seek conflict, confrontation or the new Cold War. What the United States wants is to manage competition responsibly.</p>
<p>Kangda also said that this time it was Brinten's first visit to China as a Secretary of State. It was also the first visit to China since 2018. At the same time, this is also the first visit to China since 2019, and the US government cabinet members have visited China for the first time, and "face -to -face is irreplaceable."</p>
<p>China Foreign Minister Qin Gang had a call with Brinken earlier on the 14th, and the two sides discussed the US -China relations and Taiwan issues. According to the news released by the two sides, Bollingken expressed the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels in the United States and China, as well as continuous efforts for bilateral and global issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China pointed out that Qin Gang clarified the "strict position" on the core concerns of the Chinese issue such as Taiwan, emphasizing that the United States should respect, stop interfering with the Chinese internal affairs, and stop the name of the Chinese sovereign security development in the name of competition.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal quoted a US official last week that China is conducting new spy activities on Cuba. Blinden said before the visit, "the Bayeng government has taken diplomatic measures to slow down China to project military forces worldwide."</p>
<p>Blingken was originally intended to visit Beijing in February this year, but was postponed due to the outbreak of the Chinese balloon incident. Since then, US -China relations have continued to be tense. Although the United States has continued to release the willingness of the visit, Beijing has repeatedly stated that the key to the United States and China communication is that the United States cannot "say one set and one set".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-12082022093910.html"><strong> All people want "moist"? Chinese people search for "immigration" in a single day to break 100 million times </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/huanjing/kw-12272022140923.html">Will China relax the outbound passport to restrict the "moist" tide will rise again? </a></strong></p>
<p>According to Asia reports, recently, the immigration consulting company Henley &amp; Partners issued a report, which estimates that in 2023, China will lose 13,500 rich people. In the past ten years, China has lost a millionaire. Although there are about 823,800 millionaires in China, such immigration trends will still cause China to lose millions of dollars, which may cause China's economic development to slow down.</p>
<p><strong> The rich man "Run" out of China for political stability </strong></p>
<p>The report pointed out that after the lifting of the new crown epidemic, the number of immigration consultations of East Asian customers surged, an increase of 15%over the highest number of inquiries in 2019. The number of global rich people in this year also exceeded the 2019 high, reaching 122,000. Henley &amp; Partner's Hong Kong Director Deniseeng analyzed that the main causes of these rich people chose immigrants were: I hope to exempt visas through passports to improve liquidity; hope to get better medical resources; and hope to have higher political stability.</p>
<p>The report mentioned that the Chinese authorities searched a number of foreign consulting companies in 2023. In addition, they also strengthened their control of finance and technology. In addition, China has implemented rigorous new championship control policies in the past three years. They all caused Chinese rich men to move a lot in the past two years. One of the hotspots that the rich man moved was Singapore. In 2022, 10,800 Chinese millionaires immigrated to Singapore, which also led to Singapore's house prices and prices rising.</p>
<p>In addition to mainland China, Hong Kong also moved out of 1,000 rich people this year, which may disrupt the plans of Hong Kong authorities attempting to attract the rich and let these rich people run family business in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The report also analyzed that India is a country with a maximum of millions of wealthy people after China. However, the net outflow value of the rich in India is only 6,500, which is not high compared with the number of people in previous years. This is because India has been constantly becoming a millionaire. It is different from that China has not grown in the number of rich people since 2017. Essence</p>

However, the attacker suspected that he had returned to China. At the same time, there are media reports that the British foreign minister may visit China at the end of July, and senior CCP officials will also visit Britain next week.

<p>Several Hong Kong people participated in the rally after Southampton, southern England on Sunday (11th), were attacked by suspected Chinese students and attracted attention in the British and Hong Kong people. Former Hong Kong Legislative Councilor Luo Guancong, who was in exile, and CatherineWest, a British Labor member who has always been concerned about Hong Kong issues, urged the British Security Secretary of State Tom Tugendhat to investigate the incident.</p>
<p>** The Minister of Security may have returned to China for two days after two days.</p>
<p>On the third day after the attack, Tomtugndhat finally responded. He intercepted the relevant reports in Twitter that the incident was extremely serious. The police were investigating, emphasizing that the behavior of dismissal was not tolerated: "Freedom of speech is the foundation of our country. We cannot tolerate those who tell the truth to the power to the truth. Or hurt. "</p>
<p>However, some netizens found WeChat, which was suspected of attacking Chinese students suspected of being attacked by Chinese students. The posts showed that they were likely to set off back to China. The station asked the Hampshire police to verify that the police said that they were continuing to investigate, and there was no new information at this stage. The police responded a few days ago that the incident involved the "Hate-RelatedAssAult", causing a minor injury, but did not explain whether anyone was arrested.</p>
<p>After investigating the information, it is not the first time in the British Hong Kong people to be attacked for protests. In October last year, when Hong Kong people Bobchan protested by Manchester's "20th National Congress", it was dragged into the embassy by many Chinese diplomats in Manchester City in Manchester City. In November 2021, a group of Hong Kong demonstrators protested on Chinatown, London, opposing the Chinese group's "anti -discrimination" rally for the CCP to "wash" and was attacked by more than 10 Chinese people. Some Hong Kong people were beaten to break the blood, but the incident was not available.</p>
<p><strong> Councilor follows Hong Kong people's security foreign ministers refusing to respond positively </strong></p>
<p>At the British Parliament Conference on Tuesday (13th), Labor Party Councilor Wester asked the security issues of British Hong Kong people and asked Foreign Minister JameScleverly: "The Hong Kong group is still very scared. The government can be outside the UK. Will you make a commitment in the parliament today? You will cooperate with the government colleagues to urgently deal with the security doubts of Hong Kong people? This is what you promised to me last year. "</p>
<p>However, in response, Cleverly only said that it had confirmed to the Chinese government that the "Chinese Overseas Police Department" in the UK has not operated again, and has not responded to the security issues of Hong Kong people.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong> Analysis: Hong Kong people's voice has not been able to control the British policy to China </strong></p>
<p>Huang Weiguo, a Hong Kong international relations scholar who moved to the UK, accepted an interview with this station, saying that it was not just the British Foreign Minister, but the US Secretary of State Brillings was about to visit China. He believes that although Britain and the United States are still tough in China such as technology, they do not want to be too hostile to China in their posture.</p>
<p>In this context, coupled with the influence of most British people who did not experience the infiltration of China, domestic public opinion failed to form sufficient pressure, so it was difficult for Hong Kong people to shake the British government's policies to China.</p>
<p>Huang Weiguo said: "Temporarily public opinion in the UK, Chinese issues and Chinese penetration are not the themes. It is difficult to rely on the voice of Hong Kong people to influence the British government. Although the number of Hong Kong people who come to the UK is a lot, they have been in the past few years. , Still not becoming an important voice, enough to affect the British government's foreign policy, and even attitude towards China. We must also admit that there is such an objective limit. "</p>
<p>He believes that in the British and Hong Kong people's organizations and initiatives, or adjustable strategies, and use the new crown epidemic, to explain the influence of the Chinese regime on the people of the world on the people of the world, it is expected to break through the British public opinion environment.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) This week, the China -Arab Business Cooperation Forum was held in the Saudi Capital Liade.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/無視西方擔憂-沙中開啟新商業合作/a-65886571)In just two days, there were signs of changes in the balance of power in the Middle East. On the first day of the forum, China and Arabia announced a $ 10 billion investment agreement.</p>
<p>The Saudi News Agency (SPA) reported that the two sides signed 30 agreements in many fields such as technology, renewable energy, agriculture, real estate, mining, tourism and medical care.</p>
<p>It is reported to describe the 10th Entrepreneur Conference of the China -Arab Cooperation Forum. It is a large -scale gathering from more than 3,500 business leaders, innovators and decision makers from more than 26 countries, including the largest Chinese delegation in history.</p>
<p>So far, Saudi Arabia has always been the main partner of the United States in the Middle East, and these new transactions reached with China have once again proved <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/为何美元在中东的主导地位出现衰退/a-65706009">the United States has weakened its influence in the region</a>Essence Three months ago, China promoted the long -term hostile <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/沙特和伊朗外长在北京签署恢复邦交声明/a-65251448">Saudi Arabia and Iran reached a settlement</a>Essence</p>
<h3>Electric vehicle cooperation</h3>
<p>Among the new investment funds of Zhongsha, more than half of the funds will be used to allow Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers Human Horizons to establish a new car production line in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz Binsalman (Prince Abdulaziz Binsalman) told Chinese representatives: "We don't have to compete with China, but to cooperate with China."</p>
<p>He diluted the western suspicion of the increasingly close relationship between Beijing and Riyadh: "I actually ignored this, because as a businessman, you will seize the opportunity to come."</p>
<p>A few days ago, U.S. Secretary of State Brosky told Saudi Foreign Minister that <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國接待巴勒斯坦總統-深化中東外交/a-65904007">Washington did not force Saudi Arabia to choose a border station between the United States and China</a>Essence</p>
<p>The Saudi leadership has expressed his hope to avoid zero -sum games, which means geopolitical competition between the United States and China. Some analysts believe that Saudi Arabia can use this competition to seek benefits for themselves. Dr. DAWN C. Murphy, an associate professor of International Security Research, said to Germany: "China's influence gives the Middle East countries more room for bargaining with the United States."</p>
<p>"But I don't think that these countries expect that China will provide the same security as the United States ... This is indeed an economic and political existence."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-14T13-51-00Z/65903777_401.jpg" />The Macga Light Rail system built by China Railway allows hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to shuttle in the holy city.</p>
<h3>From energy trade to 2030 Vision</h3>
<p>Due to China's strong demand for Saudi oil, China -Saudi countries have maintained strong and powerful economic connections for decades. According to the Saudi government data, the trade value between the two countries in 2022 exceeded $ 106 billion, an increase of 30%over the previous year. In contrast, the US and Saudi Arabia's trade volume is $ 55 billion.</p>
<p>China's half of the oil imported from the Middle East is the largest oil buyer in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Nowadays, Saudi Arabia is trying to achieve economic diversification beyond energy production through the 2030 vision plan. Chinese companies will benefit from huge infrastructure contracts obtained from the country.</p>
<p>The Macga Light Rail system built by China Railway allows hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to shuttle in the holy city. This 18 -kilometer line has nine stations, which is the first line built by Chinese companies in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In other current transactions, a Chinese construction company has won a contract to build a 28 -kilometer high -speed railway tunnel, which leads to Saudi Arabia's smart city "New Future City" (NEOM).</p>
<p>Some Middle East countries have signed infrastructure projects related to the China Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative is also known as the New Silk Road, which aims to promote trade in Asia and other parts of the world.</p>
<h3>Saudi Iranian settlement: a turning point</h3>
<p>In March of this year, seven years after the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, China unexpectedly contributed to Saudi Arabia and Iran's reconciliation. This shows China's growing influence in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The end of hostile relations has also promoted Saudi Arabia to restore relations with Syria, and the United States has criticized this.</p>
<p>What embarrass the United States is that Palestine's leader Abbas is currently visiting Beijing. Earlier China expressed his willingness to help promote peaceful negotiations between Israel and Palestine for a long time.</p>
<p>In 2018, the US -Sausa relationship deteriorated after being killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in the U.S. residents and Saudi Arabia with different political opinions.</p>
<p>As the US President Biden took office in early 2021, bilateral relations further deteriorated. The Biden government issued a US intelligence assessment report saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Ben-Salman(Mohammed binSalman)The killing of Kashuji was approved, but the Saudi Crown Prince denied it.</p>
<p>Other disputes also include Saudi Arabia's conflict, human rights issues, and oil prices.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-14T13-51-00Z/57061087_401.jpg" />Saudi leaders expressed their willingness to accept Beijing for Petroleum.</p>
<h3>BRICS country competition and the voices of de -US dollar</h3>
<p>As Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Barin, and Iran are preparing to join the Geopolitics Group led by China, the United States is facing further competition in the region. The current BRICS members include China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa.</p>
<p>Western sanctions on Russia due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, including frozen Russia's central banks of about $ 300 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Many rich non -Western countries have began to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and the US banking system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/金磚五國覓替代貨幣-籲重新平衡世界秩序/a-65800252">BRICS</a>It has established its own SWIFT banking payment system and is currently considering alternative currencies.</p>

This football game was more like a grand carnival, attracting countless fans and media attention. However, on June 13, the Chinese Football Association issued a notice to investigate Guizhou Village Super "survey."</p>
<p>The so -called "Guizhou Village Super" is a super league in Rongjiang and Meimei Village in Guizhou Province. This game was very popular in the rural sports circle in Guizhou Province, and tens of thousands of fans went to the grand event. In addition to football games, there are also concerts, ethnic costumes, and national music performances, which are a grand summer rural carnival.</p>
<p>The popular "Guizhou Village Super" not only attracted the attention of fans, audiences, and media, but also attracted the attention of the Chinese Football Association. Chinese Media Lake Sports reported on June 13 that there are rumors that the Chinese Football Association will go to Rongjiang, Guizhou to inspect the "Village Super" football league. Prior to this, the notification documents issued by the Suspected Football Association had been circulated on the Internet. The document states that the investigation is divided into three aspects, including investigating the basic situation of "village super", understanding the practices and beneficial experience of innovation, as well as related work needs, problems and suggestions, etc. The results and experience of the aspects; especially the relevant work results and experience of helping the revitalization of the countryside, and suggestions on the social responsibility work of the Football Association, including investigating the construction of the grass -roots football associations.</p>
<p>Although the official confirmation from the Football Association has not yet been seen, this document has spread among fans and has caused widespread public opinion. A netizen who pays attention to football events says in writing: "Frankly speaking, this kind of folk game is unprofessional, is amateur, and does not meet the relevant regulations of the Football Association. In this way Registration is required. As soon as the Football Association intervenes, it is estimated that the people's events will only be yellow for a few years. "</p>
<p>For personal safety considerations, the netizen was unwilling to have an interview, but he was not the only person who questioned the voice. Many netizens on the Internet discussed for this, saying that "the Football Association can be very good at no matter how good it is", "the Super League is not there, there is no Chinese Super League. To understand, go to investigate the village super ".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T14-12-00-04-00/000002.png" />Fans watching the village Super competition (screenshot of the network/Zhou Guangsheng) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/cm-06132023134242.html/cm10.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T14-12-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a><strong> Behind the popular folk event </strong></p>
<p>Known as the "Village Super", the Guizhou Rongjiang and Meimei Rural Football Super League is a rural community sports event organized by the local people spontaneously organized. Entering different occupations, some people sell fish and sell pork, excavators, and some people are teachers or civil servants. The outside world believes that the spontaneous and amateur of "Guizhou Village Super" brings out the enthusiasm and dedication of the people.</p>
<p>Zhang Ling, a professor at the School of Public Management of Guizhou University of Finance and Economics, told the Chinese media "Tide News" rural competitions "out of the circle" because with the improvement of material living standards, the demand for spiritual culture of farmers is becoming more and more intense. The project of fire is the product of the people breeding, and the masses have a deep foundation.</p>
<p>Yang Weidong, the son of Xue Yinxian, a former Chinese sports team doctor who lives in Germany, is worried that Chinese sports events are often tied with money power.</p>
<p>Yang Weidong: "(Chinese government) abandoned Mao Zedong's" Friendship First, the second competition ". In order to compete for the championship and the championship, various problems have occurred. After retiring, the promotion is full. Only when this system leaves sports can sports grow freely and get better. "</p>
<p>At present, there are news on the Internet that Guizhou Village Football formally rejected the football skills and tactical guidance of the National Football Association. Although this station cannot independently verify the relevant news, this statement has relieved the majority of fans. Some netizens reviewed the "Black History" of the Football Association on the Internet and asked: "Is it better to let the village super guide the Football Association?"</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65913772/64828174"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-14T14-31-00Z/64828174_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The Austrian Standard Daily commented that in order to reverse the weak state of the employment market, the Chinese government launched a "special operation of 100 million recruitment". The comments entitled "Where to Creating the Unemployment Rate of the Creative Records" wrote: "One possible cause of the rise of youth unemployment rates is the control measures during the epidemic: at that time, many college students were forced to delay their studies without looking for them to find them. Work. In addition, this is also closely related to people's high expectations of the economic recovery. Although the Chinese economy has returned to growth, the increase is far lower than in the past. The real estate crisis, debt issues, and geopolitical disputes with the United States also curb The Chinese economy has grown. All these have entered the Chinese employment market into 'bottlenecks'. China's employment market has always been fiercely competitive, and the movement of personnel is extremely frequent. Employees have to resign after a few months of employment, because other companies have given them. Better salary conditions are issues that foreign enterprises must face. Enterprises executives complained that employees often have to change jobs due to a few yuan salary difference, or require long -term vacation after returning to their homes. Just a few years ago, a medium -sized enterprise near Shanghai had stated: 'After the Spring Festival, the average employee will return to work on average.' "</p>
<p>Comments wrote that, compared with the low -end employment market with frequent flow of staff, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/专访高考制度并非中国内卷的根源/a-65852365">college graduates want to find a long -term stable job, this tendency also makes the situation of high -end jobs "more monks and less porridge". </a>"The government hopes to stabilize college students who cannot find jobs by increasing carrots. The strict news review system established after 1989 is to maintain a high alert. The street protests that appear in the later period of the policy will also be banned as soon as possible.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-14T14-31-00Z/64828438_401.jpg" />College graduates are more inclined to find a long -term stable job.</p>
<p>But in the long run, the population curve will eventually solve the problem of unemployment. A few years ago, the Communist Party of China, which controlled everything, finally realized that the disadvantage of a policy of a childization policy began in the 1980s was far greater than the benefits. So the government changed the policy: Beginning in 2016, parents who are willing to have three babies will even be rewarded in some cities. Nevertheless, China's fertility desire is far lower than the party's expectations. China's population is constantly decreasing, and of course the unemployment population will decrease. "</p>
<p>The issue of unemployment rates in China ’s record has also attracted the attention of the two websites of German TV. A report from Beijing reported from Beijing:</p>
<p>"In social media, a song called" Happy Kong Yiji "suddenly became popular a few days ago. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率居高不下-靠孔乙己脱长衫解决/a-65732307">Kong Yiji is a character created by Chinese writer Lu Xun.</a>When the song sang, Kong Yiji was starved to death as a declined scholar. Within a day, this song has received more than 4 million clicks. But the good times didn't last long, and this song failed to escape the fate of being deleted.</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction permeated among young people may danger to the party's dominance. But after prayer, there are not many things young people can do. A college student who prayed for blessings in a lama temple told reporters that she would go to a state -owned enterprise for internship and then find a job. Young people who are trying to find a job like her are countless this year. "</p>

<p>France discovered a large -scale false information movement related to Russia, and a French Ministry of Foreign Affairs website set up a fake French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also targets other government websites as the goal, disguised well -known French media, to discredit Ukraine and French Western allies.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the large -scale false information campaign named RNN has been carried out for more than a year. It originally originated from the multi -language factual verification platform that Russia used to change the Ukrainian discussion.</p>
<p>The French Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Affairs Cologne issued a statement on Tuesday (June 13) saying: "This movement is mainly to impersonate national media and government websites by creating false web pages and create false accounts on social media networks."</p>
<p>Cologne said that although France cannot blame the Russian authorities directly on the Russian authorities, RNN is related to the Russian Embassy and Russian cultural institutions.</p>
<p>This is the first time that France has publicly acknowledged that there has been an activity in France with Russia.</p>
<p>French officials said that the process of deleting such domain names was very time -consuming, and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs's website was removed 15 days later.</p>
<p>The French government also specifically pointed out the activities of Russia in Africa, saying that actors who have associated with Moscow tried to discredit France in West Africa, saying that the orthodox media and social media platforms of West Africa were full of false information about France.</p>
<p>Western countries have always been very concerned about the use of social media and the Internet to spread false or misleading information, trying to create public opinion that is conducive to Russia, and change its positions in Ukraine in the Ukrainian war.</p>
<p>Moscow has always denied hackers.</p>

<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>Recently, an article on the so -called "U.S. Indo -Pacific Command Speech" has been circulated on Twitter and several major social media platforms in China. The article pointed out that "in an interview with the British" Guardian ", the United States Indian commander Aquilino said that if it was intercepted by Chinese warships next time, it would give priority to attacking Chinese warships."</p>
<p>The Asian factual investigation of the laboratory found the British, the United States, Australia, and the international version of the Guardian, and no above reports were found. At the same time, the U.S. India Command told the laboratory that this statement was not correct. The U.S. Indo -Pacific Commander did not accept an interview with the Guardian and did not make this remark.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Navy released on June 4th <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P_sxzBr4zU">a film</a>The Usschung-Hoon destroyer and the Canadian cruise ships traveled to the Taiwan Strait with the Canadian cruiser on the 3rd, and the Suzhou destroyer was over by the Chinese Suzhou. The shortest distance between each other was only 150 yards. The Chinese military rebuked the United States and Canada's joint navigation to "deliberately provoke risks", and a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="http://mz.china-embassy.gov.cn/fyrth/202306/t20230605_11089966.htm">Wang Wenbin responded</a>The United States is provocative, and China is treated in accordance with laws and regulations.</p>
<p>NetEase Wang Yunfei Military Review on the 7th published "The U.S. -Indo -Pacific Commander has to attack first. At the door of the house, the PLA has done a good job of winning various plans", which mentioned that recently the United States India -Pacific Commander Aguilino([ John C.Aquilino(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Aquilino))In an interview with the British "Guardian", "we will apply to the Ministry of Defense to pay attention to authorization, obtain the authority of the opponent in the next free sailing, and fight against the other party's provocative behavior."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T15-59-48-04-00/000002.png" />Many users of Weibo platform forwarded the so -called Aquilino's interview with the Guardian (/Asian factual inspection laboratory drawing) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06142023155404.html/p1.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T15-59-48-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Although the NetEase number said on the 9th, it was interpreted by Weibo netizens, but this remark was still fermented online. There are related posts, and the content is simplified as "the U.S. Army's Indo -Pacific Commander Aquilino said that if it is intercepted by Chinese warships next time, it will give priority to fire to attack the Chinese warships", and add " # U.S. military threatening to open fire first" Hashtag, until the deadline of this article (14), there are still relevant remarks circulating on the Internet.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T15-59-48-04-00/000004.png" />The so -called Aquilino interviews in various social media have been further circulated as "the U.S. military will start fire to Chinese warships." (/Asian facts check the laboratory drawing) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06142023155404.html/p2.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-14T15-59-48-04-00/000005.png" /></a>The Asian factual investigation laboratory searches for the British, the United States, Australia, and the International Edition of the Guardian, and searches for "Indo-pacific CommandSite: www.theguardian.com". Only one report related to this voyage conflict is found. It was reported from the Associated Press on June 5th from the Guardian "[<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/taiwan-strait-footage-released-of-near-miss-between-chinese-warship-and-us-destroyer">Taiwan Strait: The shot of the collision between the Chinese warship and the American destroyer was made public</a>Essence "</p>
<p>The report only quoted the Indica Command statement, indicating that China's actions violated the maritime regulations of the safety of international waters. There is no statement of Indica Commander Aquilino, nor does it mention the words such as "direct fire".</p>
<p>Asian facts checking the laboratory to verify the "fire theory" circulating in Chinese social media from the Chinese Indo -Pacific Command. The interview did not issue a statement mentioned in your email. "</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Indo -Pacific Command stated that General Aquilino did not accept an interview with the Guardian, nor did he publish a remark of "repeatedly being intercepted by Chinese warships, and will give priority to fire to attack Chinese warships. The statement is wrong, and the British "Guardian" has not issued relevant reports.</p>
<p>In addition, whether the Taiwan Strait is an international waters, it will be free to sail and pass the ships and aircrafts of various countries and aircraft? Can you refer to <a href="https://www.rfa.org/cantonese/news/factcheck/twstrait-04182023152223.html">the US military advocates that the Taiwan Strait is a "international waters", is it reasonable to oppose China? </a>Check the report.</p>

<p><strong> Pre -market transaction focus </strong>:</p>
<p>● Advanced Microdevices released the latest artificial intelligence chip MI300X overnight. CEO Su Zifeng said that customers will start to "experience" the new chip in the third quarter.

<p><strong> (New York Stock Exchange code: HD) </strong></p>
<p>The quarterly hosted turnover released by the world's largest furniture decoration retailer has made many investors surprised, because the turnover is the most expected in 20 years. Not only that, Jiadebao also lowered its performance forecast for the whole year this year. It can be seen that American consumers' interest in home improvement and purchase of large products such as grilled racks has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Family Bao also said that the price of cold weather and decline in wood also affected the Group's sales in this quarter. The last time family had such a "error" of a quarterly turnover in November 2002. This is also the goal of Family Bao's second consecutive quarter that Wall Street analysts have settled on it.</p>
<p>According to the performance report of the first quarter of this year as of the end of April this year, the Group's turnover fell 4.2 % to US $ 37.26 billion. The Group's net profit is US $ 3.8 billion, and its profit is $ 382 per share, which is 8.5 % less than $ 4.230 million or $ 4.09 per share. The average prediction of analysts collected by Refinitiv is the turnover of US $ 38.28 billion, with a profit of $ 3.80 per share.</p>
<p>Family Bao said that it is currently expected that sales and comparable sales of this fiscal year will drop by 2 % to 5 %. This is roughly the same as the annual sales it had previously predicted. However, this year's operating profit margin is expected to fall to 14 % to 14.3 %, and the previous home has predicted that the operating profit margin can be maintained at 14.5 %.</p>
<p>RichardmcPhail, chief financial officer of Family Bao, said the group expects that the 2023 will be a year of business performance. The Americans have a huge demand for home decoration during the epidemic, which has increased the annual sales of the group about $ 47 billion over three years ago. However, when the interest rate of mortgage loans rises and consumers are beginning to turn their expenses to service projects, the company's sales trend is expected to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Compared with the same period last year, the customer's transaction volume in the first quarter dropped by nearly 5 %, but the average consumption of customers remained at the level of $ 91.92.</p>
<p>Of the 24 analysts of Tipranks, 14 were rated to the family's treasure stocks, and 10 "held" rating. The average target price of the first -year period was $ 317.36.</p>

<h1>Lebanon President 12 degrees Difficulties in the Lord and opponents and the opponents are difficult to understand</h1>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Berut, 14th) The Lebanon Parliament voted on the new presidential candidate today for the 12th time, but no one qualified, because the power of the "Hezbollah" and the opponent's disagreement of the "Hezbollah", which was supported by Iran, was difficult to understand. It was spoiled this vote.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-14T7-32-09-00-00/000000.png" />Lebanon, who is in crisis for more than 7 months, has no head of state. The last vote was on January 19.</p>
<p>Lebanon President is selected by Congress and has a term of 6 years in his term. The presidential power includes the signing of the bill to become the law, appointing the new Prime Minister, and the composition of the government before the voting of Congress.</p>
<p>According to Lebanon's long -term power sharing system, the President's large position retains the Maronite Christian. The voting of Sleimanfrangieh, supported by the Lord, is mainly a financial officer Jihad Azour supported by Christians and non -party members.</p>
<p>However, neither of them got the number of votes that could be qualified today. In the 128 seats, Azul received 59 votes and 51 votes in Francia. According to the provisions of the election, the first round of votes must pass the threshold supported by 2/3 of Members. If no one can pass the level, the second round of voting will be more than half of the members.</p>
<p>All parliamentarians attended the vote, but many people left the voting box after leaving the voting box. Before the second round of votes that can be selected as long as 65 votes, the venue has not reached 2/3 of the legal number.</p>
<p>Hassanfadlallah, a member of the Allah, said that only "consensus" can make the presidential election successful. He told reporters before the meeting today: "We don't push other people (candidates), nor do we want them to force us."</p>
<p>Analysts said that this voting may make the political deadlock deeper, and the hope of getting better in the Lebanon economy in the collapse of 3 years will be slim.</p>
<p>Karim Bitar said: "At this stage, long -term vacuum is the most likely situation."</p>
