<p>Johnson should start a hearing in July. Hearing the opinions of the obstetrics of the diasporas who had been intervened as the target, collected the opinions of experts from national security and international relations, and then submitted the final report in October.</p>

<p>China refutes these allegations, and also derived a Canadian diplomat and warned Canada that if it takes a consistent position with the United States in Chinese policies, it may destroy the relationship with China, the second largest trading partner in China.</p>
<p>Johnson mentioned in a preliminary report that common foreign intervention tricks include online attacks, online wind direction, malicious fraud information and "use interpersonal relationships." He also pointed out that there is a lack of information on the government's internal information.</p>
<p>However, Johston refused to investigate publicly because it was about "intelligence sensitivity."</p>
<p>He said he would leave at the end of this month.</p>

<p>This time it was related to the confidential file processing after he left the White House. Last year, the Federal Investigation Agency searched for his private villa in Florida, Mar-A-LGO, and seized thousands of documents, including about 100 confidential documents.</p>
<p>According to a public prosecution on Friday, he was charged with 37 charges, saying that he hid highly sensitive documents such as US military and nuclear plans in the villa, placed in the ballroom, bathroom and even shower.</p>

Tens of thousands of members and guests went to the manor to attend the event, including a banquet hall in the discovery of the document.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Trump tried to obstruct the investigation by the Federal Investigation Bureau. He had suggested that lawyers "hidden or destroy" these documents, or told investigators that he did not have these documents.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Trump said to one of his lawyers: "If we directly tell them that there is nothing better here?"</p>

<p>He said: "Of course, all of this must be confirmed, but (in the indictment) has a lot of information for me, and it is very likely to the jury. Obviously, for the jury Say this is the case. "</p>

At that time, he was accused of forging a business record and an adult movie actress Daniels ( Stormydaniels) paid the sealing fee and was prosecuted by criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Trump surrendered in New York and appeared in court in April to deny his control. He pressed his fingerprint, but he was not locked in handcuffs, nor did he take a big head photo of the suspect.</p>
<p>Professor Tobeis believes that Trump is unlikely to be locked in handcuffs or take big head photos this time.</p>
<p>He said: "I think this is unlikely, because there is the status of the former president, and the risk of his flee is very small. He will have to negotiate or defense ... but I don't think they need to use such procedures ","</p>
<p>Once Trump's arrest documents are completed, he will be regarded as arrested and detained. After the file is handled, he will be tried, which means that he will listen to the crime and defense in court.</p>
<h3>What is the case?</h3>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Trump went to New York to surrender and appeared in court in April to deny the crime. He pressed his fingerprint, but he was not locked in handcuffs, nor did he take a big head photo of the suspect.</p>
<p>Trump should hand over all presidential documents when he left in January 2021, which is regarded as federal property.</p>
<p>Federal officials, including former presidents, are illegal to take away or retain confidential documents at the place of authorization.</p>
<p>But just a few months after Trump left the White House, the National Archives of the United States found that some documents were missing.</p>
<p>These include a letter from Trump's communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong -un, and a letter left to Trump when the former President Obama stepped down.</p>
<p>The authorities asked to provide these records, and Trump handed over some of them.</p>
<p>In August 2022, the Federal Investigation Bureau searched Trump's private villa Haihu Manor, seized 11,000 documents, parts of confidential or highest confidential documents, and some "TS/SCI", which may cause US national security to cause national security "Special serious" damage.</p>
<p>Other items include a photo clip, a handwritten note, an unknown information about the French president, and the amnesty application letter written by Trump's old friend and consultant Roger Stone.</p>
<p>Prosecutors believe that Trump has retained some of the documents under the informedness and tried to hinder the investigation and prevent the documents from being retrieved.</p>
<h3>What are the response to Trump?</h3>
<p>Trump responded an angry response, saying that it was a "scam" for political motivation. He also claimed that he "had nothing to hide" and had "openly" provided relevant documents.</p>
<p>In a series of Truth Social posts and a film, Trump repeatedly said that he was innocent and said that the complaint was a "political war" before the 2024 election.</p>
<p>He used various arguments to defend his own way of processing documents, including that he decrypted the files before the document was found.</p>
<p>Although there was also a president directly decrypted the documents in the past, there was no evidence that Trump had done so or followed any existing procedures.</p>
<p>Trump also said that some documents are personal files and are protected by administrative privileges. They do not need to be transferred to the National Archives when they are out of office. This is the prerequisite for this case.</p>
<p>He said, "No one may be allowed to see the personal documents I brought from the White House. This is not wrong."</p>
<p>Legal experts have largely denied this argument.</p>
<p>Davidsuper, a Professor of Georgetown University Law Center, told BBC that Trump's lawyer may argue that the former president is just a "very bad archiver."</p>
<p>One of the keys to the case may be a recording. It is said that Trump said in the recording that he intends to retain the documents and acknowledge that his ability to decrypt the documents is limited.</p>
<p>Professor Speel said that if the recording was true, "this almost made him sink, because it showed that he knew the words he said in public was not true."</p>
<h3>Criminal prosecution will affect the president of Trump?</h3>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to Agence France -Presse, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯傳數週內訪華-或見習近平/a-65845535">US Secretary of State Brinken</a>It is planned to visit China on June 18. Earlier this year, he delayed the original February visit plan because of the balloon storm.</p>
<p>A U.S. officials who are unwilling to disclose the above information provided the above information. Blint is said to arrive in Beijing on the 18th, which will also be the highest -level U.S. officials visiting China since the Visa Pompeo visited China in October 2018.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-10T10-47-00Z/65254363_404.jpg" />Kobe has not confirmed the plan to visit China to visit China</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has not officially confirmed this trip. National Security Conference spokesman Johnkirby said recently that Washington will announce the visits of senior officials in the "recent", but no more details are provided.</p>
<p>In November last year, US President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a meeting in Bali, trying to ease the <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体中国拒绝重新安排布林肯访华行程/a-65334015">tense bilateral relations</a>To prevent the situation from getting out of control, it has reached a consensus, and sending Brinken to China is also part of the negotiation of the two heads of state.</p>
<p>In early February, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美領空發現中國偵察氣球-布林肯推遲北京之行/a-64598956">the United States announced its airspace to monitor China to detect balloons</a>—— And then shot down, the incident aroused anger among the US members, although Beijing denied that it was a spy balloon, and insisted that it was only used for meteorological research. Brinken immediately canceled the trip to China.</p>
<p>However, in recent days, China and the United States seem to have begun to seek controlling tensions, including the White House Security Counselor last month <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美關係解凍沙利文與王毅坦率長談8小時/a-65597495">Jakesullivan and the CCP Foreign Affairs Office Wang Yi, a closed -door meeting in Austria</a>Essence</p>
<p>In recent years, the tension between the two world's largest economies has been upgraded. One of the most important friction points is the Taiwan issue.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the United States and five allies countries issued a joint statement on Friday to condemn the use of trade operations equivalent to economic coercion. The statement did not name it separately, but it means China.</p>
<p>The statement emphasizes that "trade -related economic coercion and non -market -oriented policies and operations" threatened the international multilateral trading system and "endangered the relationship between the country."</p>
<h3>Interview: The United States is time to indicate the willingness to dialogue</h3>
<p>Australia, Britain, Canada, Japan and New Zealand jointly participated in this joint statement initiated by the United States. Except for Japan, these countries are members of the so -called "Five Eye Alliance". In addition, the four countries of the United States, Japan, and Canada are also members of the Seventh Kingdom Group (G7).</p>
<p>Last month, the leaders of the Seven Kingdoms had just signed an initiative calling for the cracking down on economic coercion to ensure that any attempt to make economic dependence as a weapon will eventually fail and face the consequences.</p>
<p>Washington has expressed concern about Beijing's trade policy. An official of a US Trade Representative Office mentioned in an interview with the media on relevant joint statements that China had implemented a ban on Lithuania because Lithuania allowed Taiwan to set up a status in the country equivalent to the representative offices of theresses.</p>
<p>However, unlike the complete hostile position adopted by the former Trump at the end of his term, the Biden government has recently sought to maintain cooperation with China in a limited field, such as climate protection.</p>

The locals said that in the past few months, the place has been shelled intermittently, but the intensity of the attack on Thursday has been paralyzed in the last Thursday.

<p>The locals are also very worried. "We don't know who protects us and helps us." A student directly shouted in a video released in Telegram. He also expressed the anger of many people living in the region. "Why do we escape here? Push the front line away from us and save Belgore and Sipkino."</p>
<p>In view of the increasing number of raids in Russia in Russia in recent weeks, some residents in Belgore asked the governor to announce that the region entered an emergency so that they could get national compensation.</p>

In addition to breaking the title of 22 Grand Slam Gold Cup that he maintained with Spain's good player Rafaelnadal, he can also become the oldest champion of the French Open and the only person to win all the 4 Grand Slam events at least 3 times. Essence</p>
<p>Among the women's players, only Margaret Court, Steffi Graf, and Serena Williams can have this achievement.</p>
<p>Jokovic said, "The only thing I can say is that I am very focused, and history is always lingering in my mind." He is the French Open champion in 2016 and 2021, and the oldest final player in French Open in 1993.</p>
<p>Jokovic has reached the Grand Slam finals this time. If he defeats Luther, the world ranking will return to the world's first, squeezing Carlos Alcaraz, which he defeated in the quasi -finals.</p>
<p>Jokovic's victory today will enable him to enter the medium point of historic "Calendar Grandslam". "Annual Grand Slam" refers to sweeping all the Tennis 4 Grand Slam events in the same year. Men's singles are currently only completed by Don Budge in the United States and the Australian Legend Rodlaver. The last time was in 1969.</p>
<p>Jokovic had the opportunity to create a "annual Grand Slam" in 2021, but eventually lost to Russia's DaniilMedvedev under the pressure of the U.S. Open final under pressure. Now he refuses to think about these things. Worried about repeating the same mistake</p>

Although Sino -US relations are becoming increasingly tense, there are still many Chinese people who go to the United States through various channels. What are the differences between new immigrants and old immigrants, how do they look at each other? Our reporter talked with several new and old immigrants.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Xiaohong wants to come to the United States after a few years of college graduation and work. He said that he only applied for a unknown university because he was preparing to have a hurry. Ordinary jobs, but also actively preparing for the technology of technology to improve themselves.</p>
<h3>Hidden contempt chain</h3>
<p>As a member of the new immigrant, Xiaohong's biggest experience of the local Chinese community is a hidden chain of contempt. "Situments and the contempt of green cards are still working hard to draw visas. Technical immigrants and outstanding talents despise their identity by marriage, doctoral students despise their bachelor's degree."</p>
<p>"It seems that the compatriots look down more," he told reporters. When I was in contact with some old immigrants, many people learned that he was not studying at a famous university or a major that was easy to find a high -paying job. The name "Code Nong". Some people suggested that he go to the programming course on the Internet, some suggest that he read another degree. Some people suggest that he rely on questions and self -study, and then find someone to recommend jobs on website and other websites. "I think many of them are also out of good intentions, but sometimes they say how much you can save this job now. This is quite hurtful." When he was renting a house, he was also pitted by compatriots "After the lease, it should be the maintenance cost of the landlord according to the lease. He did not let me pay for it, but also lost his money. Later, another American tenant struggled to let the landlord bear all the maintenance costs."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/海外华人自述我如何看身份认同与文化归属/a-62777605">Extended Reading -Overseas Chinese Read: How do I look at identity and cultural belonging</a>After two consecutive years of international students in the United States, international students have risen back, including [Chinese students] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中美关系僵持不下留学生何去何从/a-57610602">Chinese students</a>Essence According to the number of visas signed by the US embassy and consulates issued by the U.S. State Department, the number of Chinese students obtained the US F1 student visa in the first quarter of 2023 was 5,413, which was significantly increased compared to the previous three years, and surpassed before the epidemic. At the same time.</p>
<p>Data statistics show that Chinese students studying in the United States are developing aging and aging. In 2022, American middle school recruited a total of 8,626 international students from China, accounting for 27%of all international students, and it was the highest proportion country.</p>
<p>In addition to students in the United States, the restrictions brought by China's strict epidemic prevention policy, hidden dangers in the real estate market, have also made some high -net -worth individuals move the idea of "moisturizing" to the United States. In the "2021 China Private Wealth Report" jointly released by China Merchants Bank and Bain Council, the United States is the second place in the transfer station and destination of overseas asset allocation stations and destinations of high -net -worth individuals in Mainland China, second only to Hong Kong, China.</p>
<p>In addition, some Chinese who have no way to obtain a US visa have chosen the "wiring" way. According to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, six months since October 2022, more than 6,500 Chinese citizens were arrested at the border between the United States and Mexico, which is the highest data recorded since the record. In the group of Douyin, Twitter, and Telegram, many people also shared their successful "routing" experiences, and many people were eager to try after reading it.</p>
<h3>can be integrated but still lonely</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhai is a middle -aged middle -class immigrant. She originally had her favorite job in Shanghai, and had a good relationship with good girlfriends, classmates and colleagues.</p>
<p>But her husband moved to the United States because of his work mobilization, and she was unwilling to separate for a long time. She also abandoned her circle and work in the country. Because of the epidemic, everyone couldn't go out at home at home, and social activities were almost zero, so the first year when they came to the United States, they had hardly made any friends. When her husband is busy with work, she takes care of all kinds of trivial matters, learned to deal with maintenance workers, water management workers, and cleaner, and learned to communicate with teachers participating in the children's school. Car skills, pick -up children to participate in various extracurricular activities, and even learned to work with the landlord who breach of the contract.</p>
<p>"Saying integration is also considered to be integrated. I have encountered a lot of friends who have helped and many busy, especially when they are also mothers. Send the rice dumplings made by my own family. Moon cakes but people of the same age also have their own work, family, and children. It is difficult to develop very close friendship like when they are young, "she told reporters.</p>
<p>She also said that some old immigrants always like to talk about new immigrants who like to preach. She joked: "Daddy is very heavy." "For example, ask you where you live, and then say why it is not good, and then tell you which block you should live in, where to buy a house to see the bullish. It's delicious, and then introduce you to the place where they often go. "</p>
<h3>Different expression on political appeal</h3>
<p>Ms. Qin in Texas has started from university to work and has lived in the United States for nearly two decades. During the period, there were several states in the east and west coasts and the central parts. She mentioned that some young people who have recently met and have just come to the United States and soon feel that they are "too concerned about current affairs."</p>
<p>The Texas conservative government officials once wanted to promote the law that restricted the Chinese people buying real estate in Texas. She led the Chinese on the street to protest and went to the door of the state parliament to give a sign. Special American social media vocalized, but she said that the other party did not care when she was propagating to young people who just came to the United States.</p>

<p>"Many of them have never heard of this. Even if they have heard of it, they feel that they have no plans to buy a house in the short term, so they have nothing to do with their own lives." Ms. Qin feels that this group of new immigrants does not seem to actively participate in the idea of local social and political issues and community construction. However, if the US government's discrimination against China is becoming more and more serious, the lives of these new immigrants will also be affected. "I think that even if the background and political stance are different, the demands should be the same at this point. Because if similar bills are passed, there may be bills in the future to limit their student visas in the United States, work visa, etc. ","</p>

<p>He believes that there are more and more Chinese immigrants in the United States. Everyone's background, preferences, ways of thinking, and work habits are very different. Incorporating the Chinese community itself is a pseudo -proposition, because it is difficult to get along with so many different people.</p>

<p>Description: The German Makato China Research Center released a study this week that in the past, Beijing has always tended to make economic coercion to other countries in an informal and uninterrupted way; in recent years The rising demand for sanctions is rising, and China is starting to improve its own sanctions policy tools.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) This research report begins, [EU] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟出台反制工具-对外来经济胁迫说不/a-65849853">EU</a><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒體歐盟擬制裁七間助俄中企/a-65545705">Considering sanctions on Chinese companies that bypass Western sanctions on the West</a>Therefore, it is necessary to understand what countermeasures China may take in advance.</p>
<p>The author believes that compared with informal and uninterrupted economic stress, the Chinese government has not used formal sanctions in the past. China did not have recently developed policy tools for improving sanctions, and the legal framework represented by the Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law allowed the Beijing authorities to impose sanctions and anti -sanctions more frequently than in the past.</p>
<p>Studies have pointed out that in 2018, a trade war with the United States was a critical moment, although a series of countermeasures promulgated by China at that time were temporarily not "sanctions". Another important time node was in 2021: At that time, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States sanctioned a series of Chinese officials and institutions on the infringement of human rights issues in Xinjiang, and Beijing quickly sacrificed countermeasures. Foreign Sanctions "](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国出台反制裁法-在华外企考虑双循环/a-57980466)Essence A set of legal frameworks around the law allowed the Chinese government to obtain a considerable space for free tailoring, which can decide when, who targets and what sanctions are implemented.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T-7-30-00Z/17595608_404.jpg" />German think tank Makato China Research Center(MERICS)It also became the anti -counterpart of the Chinese authorities in the dispute over the Xinjiang human rights issue in 2021</p>
<p>The author analyzed a number of cases, including the deputy minister of the Lithuanian traffic and communication department of 2022 in the summer of 2022, and the deputy minister of the Ministry of Communications and the Communications visited Taiwan by Chinese sanctions and US Congress McCull(Michael McCaul)Meeting with Tsai Ing -wen was sanctioned by China. The assets of the sanctions in China are frozen and prohibit Chinese citizens and institutions from conduct any transactions with the sanctions. The author pointed out that there are signs that China ’s use of such formal sanctions has become more and more frequent.</p>
<p>After analyzing 39 Chinese sanctions cases from 2012 to 2023, researchers came to a series of conclusions. The author pointed out that there are three important time nodes in building their own sanctions tools: the Sino -US trade war in 2018, the Xinjiang human rights dispute in 2021, and 2022 Russia suffered Western sanctions. Since 2018, the number of foreign sanctions implemented unilaterally in China has risen rapidly. Most of them are targeted at the American individuals and institutions, mainly for the United States' "interference in the internal affairs" on the issue of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang. The author believes that this trend will not change much in the future.</p>
<p>Studies have also invested the main means of Chinese sanctions, including: mainly for personal domestic asset freezing, visa entry bans, and prohibiting cooperation with Chinese entities; mainly for enterprises' import and export trade control. The author pointed out that the current ability to designate financial sanctions in China is still extremely limited, but the recent policy debate has shown that Beijing has at least interested interest to lay a legal foundation for financial sanctions. At present, the legal framework of Chinese sanctions is mainly based on the "Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law" and "Unreliable Entitution List". At the same time, the tools of China's foreign economic struggle are still a combination of formal sanctions and informal measures.</p>

<p>There are four institutions on the Chinese sanctions list, namely the EU Council's Political and Security Council, the Human Rights Branch of the European Parliament, the Danish Democratic Alliance Foundation, and the German Makato China Research Center. Among them, the Merics Research Center (Merics), as a think tank, has attracted particular attention. Hu Xi, the editor -in -chief of the Chinese official media "Global Times", said that cutting off the connection between the agency and China, "means that the research channel of the research center is unsustainable, and the influence will be severely hit." The German think tank issued a statement responded that it was very regrettable for the Chinese decision and rejected these allegations at the same time. "As an independent research institution, we are committed to improving a better and more diverse understanding of China. We will continue to pursue this mission by providing factual analysis.

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, the recruitment system seems to be out of order. In the past 20 years, most European countries have abolished the obligation to serve military service. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国取消义务兵役制-志愿兵进入兵营/a-15210272">For example, Germany suspended the recruitment system in 2011</a>Essence Only in the Federal House of the House of Federal House can start again under the tension or national defense situation stipulated in the Basic Law.</p>
<p>There are similar situations in many other European countries. Today, among the 29 European countries, including Turkey, only 6 countries have maintained the recruitment system since 1993. The situation of Britain, the United States, and Canada has lasted for at least 50 years.</p>
<p>In view of Russia's war against Ukraine, some countries have now begun some reflection. Some countries not only increase the national defense budget, but also discuss the re -implementation of the compulsory military service system, but these debates have only progressed among a few countries.</p>
<p><strong> Ukraine and Lithuania </strong></p>
<p>Shortly after Crimea was annexed, Ukraine and Lithuania re -implemented the obligation system for young men in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Then after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian government promulgated a law, and all men aged 18 to 60 could be called to join the army based on this law.</p>
<h3>"If the Russian army attacks Kiev again, I will participate in the battle"</h3>
<p><strong> Latvia </strong></p>
<p>This Baltic country is one of the three NATO members bordering Russia. The other two countries are Estonia and NATO New members Finland, which have never abolished the compulsory military service system. Now Latvia also wants to re -introduce the compulsory military service. Starting in 2024, all men aged 18 to 27 must receive 11 months of military training; since 2028, 7,500 Latvians will be called to join the army every year-according to NATO, this is the country's 2022 Number of professional soldiers.</p>
<p><strong> Romania </strong></p>
<p>In 2015, Romania's attempt to re -introduce the obligation system after the collapse of the Berlin wall failed, but in this spring, the current prime minister and retired general Nicolaeciuca once again expressed support for the support of obligations. A specific requirement of the Romanian Ministry of Defense is that under the circumstances, young Romanian people living abroad must report to military service within 15 days.</p>
<p><strong> Dutch and Sweden </strong></p>
<p>The Dutch armed forces lack about 9,000 recruits. This is why the Dutch government is considering strengthening the army through the compulsory military service system, as Sweden has done since 2018. Sweden abolished the compulsory military service system in 2010, but because sufficient volunteers could not be found to serve military service, this method was introduced in 2018. From then on, all Swedes, who are 18 years old, must report to the army, but like neighbor Norway: In the end, only a small number of people will be recruited.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T07-29-00Z/65310543_401.jpg" />German Defense Minister Pestorius proposed the voluntary military service system shortly after taking office</p>
<p><strong> Norway and Denmark </strong></p>
<p>Since 2016, all Norwegians must be reported at the age of 18. However, only about 9,000 candidates participating in physical fitness tests each year were called for 19 months of military service. Due to the strict selection process, the official claims that the service in Norway's military service is similar to the reputation of other higher education education. Denmark in the northern neighbor of Germany still retains the recruitment system in law, but in fact, in the past few years, it has sufficient volunteers to fill the needs of troops.</p>
<p><strong>France</strong></p>
<p>French President Macron launched the "Service Nationalunivers" in 2019. In this framework, young people can voluntarily serve the country for a month. Now the French government is considering allowing all young people aged 15 to 17 to participate, two of them are completed in military -related institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Germany</strong></p>
<p>Germany Prime Minister Shulz rejected the voluntary military service system proposed by Minister of Defense Borispistorius. Recently, Evahögl, a German Federal Parliament, who is also the Society of the Social Democratic Party as the Semitz and Pestorius, suggested that the possibility of "voluntary service" in the army or civic institutions should be discussed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65868848/59244760"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T07-30-00Z/59244760_303.jpg" /></a>Political scholar Zhang Junhua pointed out that competition between China and the United States is becoming increasingly fierce</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) Since the reform and opening up, Deng Xiaoping's "hiding light" policy that the leaders of the Communist Party of China have been adopted by the Chinese Communist Party have used Western technology and capital to take "globalized" stools. For more than thirty years, there are indeed a lot of gains. In terms of economic perspective, it has jumped into the world's second in the world. But in the era of Xi Jinping, he gradually entered the stage of competition with the United States. However, the CCP led by Xi Jinping did not seem to be a virgin "shyness" like a virgin until last year, and did not want to say the word competition. However, in the posture of "opening the skylight to speak brightly" in the United States, this competition was obviously increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>First of all, this competition was made by the United States first. Because the U.S. government first realized that China ’s tolerance for technological transfer and technical theft will directly affect the unique technical and military status of the United States in the world, thereby weakening the power of the entire democratic camp. So <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/特朗普签署国防授权法案-处处影射中国/a-51762998">Starting from Trump, the restrictions on exports and product use of companies such as Huawei</a>Essence But Trump's approach is still emotional. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登計畫收緊美國對華投資規定/a-64886618">Since Biden came to power, expand this approach to all sensitive technologies and sensitive products related to national security</a>It systematized all measures, and also worked hard to pull other countries to join him. In addition, according to the principle of "defending democratic camps", since last year, it has strengthened its military contact and assistance to other allies in Taiwan and Asia, which has a direct relationship with the lessons brought by the Ukrainian war.</p>
<h3>The United States is back</h3>
<p>So far, the United States has made progress in western Pacific in terms of military cooperation. Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan have moved closer to the United States in military and intelligence cooperation. It is necessary to see that the United States is also facing more challenges from China. Whether the United States can respond to these challenges determines its victory and defeat with China in western Pacific. This victory will be mainly reflected in two areas: one is the Taiwan Strait and the other is the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Seeing that the United States has recovered so much on the military and security of the Pacific West Coast, the CCP will naturally be dissatisfied because it directly destroys Beijing's "magnificent plan". One of the plans is to solve the Taiwan problem during Xi Jinping during his tenure, and truly become the island as a territory under Beijing. The second plan is that during the period of Xi Jinping, all the neighboring countries in China accept the definition of China's "nine sections", so that they can occupy the upper hand in energy development, fish resources, and military layout. Originally, Beijing was not difficult to implement this plan with China's own Blue-Water Navy and other military strength. However, it was not expected that the negligence of the Asia -Pacific region after the United States changed the Vietnam War and continued to strengthen activities in the region. From the freedom of navigation of warships to maintain the shipping line, to the military support for Taiwan, all the obstacles to the implementation plan for Beijing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T07-30-00Z/65813263_401.jpg" />U.S. President Biden announced high -profile after taking office: "The United States is back"</p>
<h3>soft and hard</h3>
<p>As for the balloon incident in February this year, China has a strong response. I am afraid that the United States is angry that the United States exposes the ugliness of Chinese spy behavior in front of Southeast Asian countries. As for Perlus's visit to Taiwan, it has opened a new stage that is not conducive to China ’s diplomacy. As a result, Beijing used various opportunities to scold the US government overwhelmingly, described himself as the victim of the US hegemony, and strived to occupy a moral highland in the world. At the same time, began to decompose the Western Democratic camp, make every force, pull Europe to its own side, and encourage European "strategic autonomy". But obviously, this is not effective.</p>
<p>At present, the goal of the CCP is clear: as long as the Americans stay away from the Pacific West Bank, the impact of China on the region has no opponents. Because, even though those countries that seem to be in the right of China, such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, etc., are still economically dependent on China, and they are closer to the United States in terms of security. Once the military's military existence in the district has been greatly weakened, solving Taiwan and the South China Sea issues will be solved.</p>
<p>As a result, Beijing recently adopted a dual -track strategy, which was soft and hard together. The so -called soft is that China emphasizes that China is a country that loves peace and oppose decouragement and abide by international law. The mediation person who worked hard to play the Ukrainian war and sent the Chinese government Eurasian affairs Li Hui to lobby Europe. At the same time, the 20th Shangri -La dialogue was used to let the Minister of Defense let the wind: It is the biggest disaster. At the same time, the patrol of the US warships in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait has nothing to do with the maintenance of the International Marine Law, but only to maintain its own "marine law".</p>
<p>The hard aspect is to use the so -called gray means to become impossible to exist the United States' frequent military existence on the West Coast of the Pacific Ocean. The most typical recent <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/南海較勁美稱中國戰鬥機逼近挑釁攔截/a-65775811">Intercepting US reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea</a>And [<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美中軍艦險相撞-白宮中國侵略性日增恐致傷亡/a-65823182">Danger in the Taiwan Strait is close to the American destroyer</a>Essence The premise of this gray approach is that China knows that the United States is at least all forces to avoid any military conflict with China at least, because due to the assistance to Ukraine and a series of problems in China, the United States has no time to open up in the region. battlefield. In China, some of the "brave, patriotic" soldiers, and some of the warships and fighters, so they are adventurous. China wants to use this method, which will "greatly increase the psychological pressure of the US military (Hu Xijin)", which is clearly an event that trys to create 2001 incident again. In 2001, a Chinese fighter intends to collide with a US reconnaissance aircraft. U.S. aircraft urgently landed on Hainan Island. During the incident, a Chinese pilot died, and Beijing detained 24 US crew for 11 days. He sent a letter in Washington that he released them after "regret". However, China's decision now will greatly increase the probability of this crash or ship.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T07-30-00Z/65830027_401.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Challenge facing the United States</h3>
<p>Not only technically, but also military, the Chinese government has clearly believed that its biggest competitor in the world is the United States. Moreover, Beijing has to change its previous practices to take a car and slight amendmentism, start competing with the United States in all aspects, and start formulating the rules of the game by themselves. The most realistic goal of competition is that in terms of foreign policies, it is to solve the problem of Taiwan and establish a dominant position in China in various regions, especially in the South China Sea region, that is, put them under their own control.</p>
<p>One of the challenges facing the United States in this competition is that the CCP's words and deeds are different. Not one word and deeds must cause not in accordance with the rules of the game, that is, international law. Lack of minimum trust. You know, the warships in China are adventurous to block the United States "Zhong Yun" destroyer passing the Taiwan Strait and almost the next day, and the Chinese Defense Secretary Li Shangfu emphasized in the eight hundred. "Understanding"]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国中美激烈冲突对抗是世界不可承受之痛/a-65819515)Essence For another example, Xi Jinping promised to former US President Barack Obama in 2015 that China will not be militaryized in the island of the South China Sea-and this is exactly what it has been doing since then.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that China determines that it uses gray to intercept the US military aircraft and warships, which can make the United States helpless when cruising in the region, and may finally give up or reduce the existence in the region. While using this means, China has changed the unwritten rules of the previous, such as the Taiwan Strait is no longer regarded as an international waters, but the scope of Chinese territory.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that in the toolboxes that use hard means, there are still ace in China. It is conceivable that with the mature application of Chinese artificial intelligence in military, drones, unmanned boats that may intercept American warships and military aircraft in the future, and use multiple ships to deal with the United States.</p>
<p>Alternatively, combine Russia's military forces in the Pacific to deal with regular patrols of the United States. Recently, Beijing has conducted the sixth time with the Russian Air Force with the aircraft strategic cruise, intimidating Japan, which has shown its signs.</p>
<p>In the third challenge, China will continue to strengthen military pressure on Taiwan by cutting sausage. At present, China's military aircraft and ships pass through the middle line regularly, up to 10 times a day. Although Beijing's behavior is not directly targeted at the United States, due to the obligations of the United States for Taiwan, the United States is also tired of responding.</p>
<h3>How do Chinese military exercises continue on both sides of the strait?</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, the United States is still looking for countermeasures. For example, not only mobilize AUKUS countries, but also to pull NATO countries in the European continent into the freedom of defending the Asia -Pacific region (including the Taiwan Strait). Although the European countries, such as Germany, are willing to join the South China Sea cruise, it is even more worried that the people in the United States are not regarded as the vital interests of the United States on the peace of the Taiwan Strait. Germany has decided to go to the South China Sea of China next year for a free exercise. However, avoiding expressions on the issue of crossing the Taiwan Strait, and more publicly, like France, it is publicly stated that they do not want to treat Taiwan as their own concern. The French attitude also reflects the ideas of a considerable part of the European continent. In this way, it feels that it feels that the "own marine law" implemented in the Taiwan Strait instead of international law is even more based on the "own marine law" in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Of course, the United States seems to be very hoped to ease this situation by establishing a straight line connection with Beijing (including a straight -line phone in the military). However, as the "hard and hard combination" method mentioned above, Beijing now does not oppose dialogue with the United States on the surface, but in the so -called "core interests", Xi Jinping will use the use of gray and hard means to persecute, thereby persecution The United States is Fan.</p>
<p>In short, in regional military and foreign competition, whether the Western Democratic camps led by the United States can respond to China's challenges before the US election next year, it will have a direct impact on the security pattern of the Pacific West Coast. And China ’s ignoring its own safety competition on the West Coast of the Pacific is a dangerous competition. If it is not good, it will lead to a fire between China and the United States.</p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.</p>

<p>Rama Famasa pointed out in the statement that he had "briefing" to Xi Jinping. The members of the delegation include the President of the 6 countries, including the Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda monk.</p>
<p>Rama Famasa's office did not describe when he talked with Xi Jinping, but said that the Chinese leader "praised the African mainland initiative and acknowledged that the Russian conflict had affected people's lives and African food security."</p>
<p>Beijing announced its position on the Ukrainian crisis in February, calling on the conflict of "political solution". Western countries warned that this may allow Russia to control most of the territories occupied by Ukraine.</p>
<p>China said that they were China Cube, but they were also criticized for condemning Russia to attack Ukraine and China -Russia's intimate strategic partnership.</p>
<p>Similarly, the South African ruling party, which has a close relationship with the Kremlin since the anti -ethnic isolation struggle, has not condemned Russia to invade Ukraine in an all -round way. It also said that its position is fair and in favor of dialogue.</p>
<p>The Brics Summit will debut in Johannisburg, South Africa in August, and South Africa is currently in a diplomatic problem.</p>
<p>Pu Ting, who was wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) because he was charged with illegally expelled Ukraine children, has been invited to the summit. As a member of the International Criminal Court of South Africa, he will be obliged to detain him when Panting arrives.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that Xi Jinping and Lama Famasa also talked about the preparation of the BRICS Summit. It is speculated that South Africa is considering changing the August Summit in China to avoid the arrest of Puting.</p>

<p>Image adding text,From the end of 2022 to 2023, there have been three events in the sports competition participating in the Hong Kong team or athletes, which have been mistaken for the "National Anthem" played by Hong Kong as the "National Anthem" playback:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In November 2022, the Asian Seven Rugby Series Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Team. The Hong Kong team defeated the South Korean team to win the championship in the finals. At the ceremony, "Wish to Back to Hong Kong" was played as the Chinese National Anthem. Although the hosted direction of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments apologized afterwards, the Hong Kong police still launched on whether the incident involved the "Crossing the National Anthem Regulations" <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-63635439">Criminal Investigation</a>* December of the Asian Classic Jianli Championship, the organizer missed "Rongguang" as the national anthem player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In February 2023, when the Hong Kong Ice Hockey Team participated in the third level of the World Ice Hockey Championship, the organizer broadcast the wrong national anthem. Some teammates stopped gestures and stopped. After that, the conference apologized and corrected. The Hong Kong Bing Association submitted a report afterwards, admitting that it was not successfully inspected the national anthem with the organizer at that time, but denied that the Hong Kong Sports Association stated that its allegations were held with a avoidance attitude.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>"Open Prevale</h3>
<p>The scope of applications for the prohibition of the Hong Kong government on "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" is currently unclear, but whether it will be the same as the "Hong Kong National Security Law", it can be illegally listed as illegal Hong Kong as one of the concerns.</p>
<p>For a long time, Hong Kong has been an exception of mainland China's review system, allowing foreign companies to operate relatively freely here.</p>
<p>Use Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to search this song in mainland China.</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong media reports, the Hong Kong government's application for the ban on the court mentioned that the 32 links related to "Rongguang" were mentioned in YouTube.</p>
<p>It is believed that the efforts of the Hong Kong government to strengthen restrictions may further damage the status of Hong Kong's Asian financial and economic centers -many multinational companies have transferred personnel to Singapore and other regions. In the future, more companies may choose to stay away from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>During the 2018 World Cup qualifier, some audiences raised a piece of paper printed on the Hong Kong team competition stand</p>
<p>The New York Times quoted people from the technology industry that if the Hong Kong government's application is approved, the ban may bring review difficulties and costs to American technology companies operating in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Chen Yan, managing director of the Asian Group and the person in charge of the public policy of Public Police, Meta Greater China, described the newspaper that the Hong Kong government's decision to use the court was to "open the gate."</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong media analyzed that if Google, Facebook, etc. do not comply with the ban on the Hong Kong court, the responsibilities of execution may fall on the network suppliers in Hong Kong, resulting in the possibility of Google and other platforms to be blocked in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On Saturday (June 10), Taiwan's focus on human rights groups in Hong Kong initiated a parade, gathered in Taipei Free Plaza and sang "Wish Glory to Hong Kong". It is also reported that Hong Kong people around the world are working hard to contact the local radio and broadcast the song on Monday.</p>
<p>Two days after the Hong Kong Government issued a prohibited order, the ten versions of "Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" once occupied the top ten on the music rankings of the ITUNE in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>China "Extreme Thinking" will usher in "shocking waves"</h3>
<p>Taiwan's "report" published an article "China responds to the" Shangri -La talks "with" Three Soldiers ". The author Tang Minghui pointed out that the" Shangri -La talks "in 2023 often held in Singapore in early June. The interaction is more intense than last year, making the outside world more concerned about whether it can ease the potential conflict between the United States and China.</p>
<p>The article pointed out that the display of China's "extreme thinking" failed to shrink the United States. In view of China's military strength growth in the South China Sea region, and the actions on the front line continued to increase pressure. Richardmarles, Australia, and Philippine Defense Minister Carlito Galvezjr. In Shangri -La, it is necessary to strengthen security cooperation to achieve "free and open India Pacific Ocean". Faced with the cooperation and joint exercises of the four countries in the "United States, Japan, Australia and California" and the Indo -Pacific region, NATO also entered Japan to set up a office in the east. This wave of pressure from Western countries is unprecedented by the end of the Korean War. Even if the Asia -Pacific version of NATO has not yet taken shape, it can be called "shocking waves" for China.</p>
<p>The article said that since the formation of QUAD and AUKUS, the United States and the allies have learned about the United States and China several times to learn quite experience. Although China has a North Korea, the hotspot of the US -China issues is that it is on the edge of the coast of China instead of the Caribbean Sea. China has not been China. It is probably greater than the United States to be able to talk about risk control in Shangri -La. The current situation in the United States can be divided into combination with the power of the allies, but China must use its own power to "three soldiers of the three soldiers" from north to south. The thinking of the bureau may also make more countries think about "de -risk".</p>

<p>Researchers in the United States and Israel have found that using deep brain stimulation therapy during sleep can not only significantly improve the accuracy of memory, but also enhance memory during sleep.</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported on Saturday (June 10) that the study published in the magazine published in the British "Nature · Neurology" first proved a long -term statement -during sleep, the synergy activities of hippocampus and cerebral cortex were enhanced memory to enhance memory. The key mechanism is that through the communication between the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex during the sleep, the memory in the brain can be enhanced.</p>
<p>The deep brain stimulation method is one of the important methods of treating neuropathy such as Parkinson's disease, that is, the electrode is implanted into a specific neurological area in the brain, and then the battery is stimulated to improve the function of brain cells.</p>
<p>The new research was completed by researchers from the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Tel Aviv University in the University of California. Researchers implanted electrodes in the brain of 18 patients with epilepsy to study the role of deep brain stimulation during sleep.</p>
<p>Studies have pointed out that deep brain stimulation method during sleep can improve the Haima body responsible for obtaining new memory in the brain, and the communication between the premium cortex responsible for long -term storage memory. In addition, through the monitoring of the hippocampus during the monitoring of sleep, this therapy can pass the electrical stimulus to the premium cortex accurate and regularly.</p>
<p>After the researchers compared the two groups of subjects in accepting and not accepting deep brain stimuli, they found that the deep brain stimulation method during sleep can significantly improve the accuracy of the subject's memory.</p>
<p>The researchers also monitored the impact of this method on brain activity in a single neuron unit. It was found that accurate stimulation during sleep can help strengthen exchanges between hippocampus and forehead cortex.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that as a special intervention -type stimulus therapy, the deep brain stimulation method helps improve and consolidate memory, enhance the synergy of hippocampus and cerebral cortex in the brain, and is expected to inspire memory disorders such as dementia.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) Although it has entered the 21st century, many German men still have difficulty distribution of traditional gender characters, and even fight their spouses in order to defend their supreme families. This is the latest conclusion that the German International Peace Association is the latest poll.</p>
<h3>Hands -handed people to "make women learn to be in awe"</h3>
<p>Among the agents aged 18 to 35, 33%of people believe that when a spouse quarrels, it is also acceptable to "do". <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/杀害女性的犯罪案件在德国越来越多/a-55726319">And 34%claimed that he had experienced the experience of fighting women in order to make each other awe. </a>Karsten Kassner, an expert at the German men's federal forum, said the poll results shocked him. Kascem told the Fengke Pay Industry Group: <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国平均每3天有1名女性死于伴侣之手/a-41527604">"One -third of men think that it is not worth a fuss, which is the problem. This situation must be changed as soon as possible."</a></p>
<h3>Male stereotype:</h3>
<p>In addition, most interviewees hold rejection in public plans to display homosexuality in public: 48%of the respondents believe that this behavior makes them "uncomfortable".</p>
<p>According to a report from Fengke's newspaper, polls also reflect that in many men's minds, the stereotype of "housewives" seems to be deeply ingrained: 52%of the respondents believe that the main role they play in the family is to earn enough to earn enough to earn enough Money, and women should do housework. About half of the men said they could not accept a woman with many sexual partners as partners.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-11T14-16-00Z/65883330_401.jpg" />33%believe that when a spouse quarrels, it is also acceptable to "hands -on".</p>

International Pei Youyin spokesman Alexandratschacher told Fengke's newspaper: "Traditional character distribution is still deeply rooted in rooting In society and people's minds. "</p>
<p>Kasce also said that although many men also expressed their willingness to promote equality between men and women and oppose gender bias, they are unwilling to pay practical actions for this. Kascem said that changing the framework of the entire society is the task of politics. He said that the federal government with a plan to provide paid parenting leave for his father is a good example.</p>
<p>In this questionnaire survey, a thousand men and women aged 18 to 35 were surveyed from March 9th to 21st. The "International Pei Young Association" claims to be the largest and longest children's assistance organization in the world, and branches are spreading in more than 50 countries in the world.

<p>The tension of globalization has continued to increase, and the trend of de -globalization continues, and it is difficult to deal with the collective actions required by the global climate crisis. The epidemic has led to the isolation and alienation between the country, and the Russian -Ukraine conflict brings the confrontation and wrestling of the relevant parties. Sino -US relations have shown the most tense situation since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. Wait, all these factors are intertwined together to make the world full of turbulence. This also brings greater challenges to global climate governance, because the trust and cooperation required to deal with climate issues is particularly difficult at the moment.</p>
<p>In the past month, China ’s activities on climate diplomacy are frequent. Not only do you have the practical content of climate cooperation between the two countries in the“ Sino -French Joint Statement ”, but also signed the“ Joint Statement of China -Pakistan Climate Change ”with Brazil. China’ s senior and UN climate climate The conversations of the Chairman of the Dubai Conference, Surdan, and the chairman of the European Commission Feng Delin, all mentioned that they strengthened dialogue and cooperation in climate change. In today's complex and turbulent geopolitical environment, China's climate diplomacy activities have significantly help enhance the positive cognition of Europe and Latin America in China. At the same time, by actively investing in climate diplomacy and multilaterally with these countries and regions, China can inject vitality and motivation into global climate governance.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, China has attached great importance to bilateral climate cooperation. During the tension between Sino -US relations, climate issues are still the "safety zone" where both parties work hard to maintain cooperation. At the same time, China has always attached importance to climate issues at the two levels of domestic and international, hoping to find cooperation space and contribute to the international climate governance level through bilateral or multilateral climate diplomacy. The author believes that China is actively investing in bilateral and multilateral climate diplomacy, helping the world to better understand China's climate policy and actions. When China ’s actions and achievements on climate issues are seen and recognized by the outside world, it will form a benign interaction. China’ s climate and even global climate management will benefit.</p>
<p><strong> Great Power Cooperation </strong></p>
<p>Climate problems are systemic problems, which require systemic forces to solve, and it is difficult to support any country.</p>
<p>From the perspective of emissions data, the cooperation of large powers has irreplaceable importance to completing the Paris Agreement's commitment. In 2021, the emissions of the top six countries (China, the United States, Europe, India, India, Russia, and Japan) accounted for about 68%of the global carbon displacement, and the proportion of carbon emissions between the three parties in China and the United States accounted for more than 50%. As the world's two largest economies, the carbon emissions co -authored by China and the United States account for more than 40%of the global total, which means that there is no coordination and cooperation between large powers, and global climate governance is unsustainable.</p>
<p>From the perspective of action, the cooperation of large powers is a necessary condition for promoting the development of global climate governance. Coping a climate crisis is a collective action. Looking back at the process of this operation, it will be found that although the middle of the country has gone through twists and turns, the role of the great power and the leading role is significant. The EU played a leading role in the setting of issues, technical reserves, and climatic goals. For example, in March 2020, the European Union wrote its carbon neutrality into the law, and many countries have followed suit; while China -US climate cooperation has been the main driving force for the top -level design of the global climate governance, which ultimately promotes the achievement of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>However, there is a trust deficit between east and west, north and south in global climate governance. In terms of the global climate crisis, the issues such as "who do what they do" and "who do it first, and then do it" have been chattering for dozens of years. Regardless of whether it is within developed countries, between developing countries and developing countries, or inside the developing countries, the trust deficit between each other is obvious to the global climate governance.</p>
<p>The most obvious is the funding problem of the Green Climate Fund. In 2010, the 16th Convention on the Convention on the Framework of the United Nations Climate Change established the Green Climate Fund (GCF)It is stipulated that developed countries should invest a rapid start -up funds for the Green Climate Fund from 2010 to 2012 as the Green Climate Fund, and the annual capital contribution of US $ 100 billion per year between 2013 and 2020 helps developing countries to actively respond to climate change. However, the definition of climate fund support and statistics, reports, and accounting systems are still not clear enough, and which fund support should be included in the accounting.</p>
<p>According to the Organisization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), in 2020, developed countries provide climate actions in developing countries and leveraged $ 83.3 billion. This year, it is expected to achieve the goal of $ 100 billion per year.</p>
<p>The lack of leadership is also a major obstacle to the climate crisis. The EU often plays the leading role in the field of global climate governance. It is often at the forefront of the world in terms of ideas or actions, but often because of its own economic development problems, internal condensation and unity. The performance is insufficient. The United States was in terms of domestic political polarization, which led to its response to climatic issues violently like a roller coaster. The Democratic Party had a climatic issue. During the term of office of Trump, the United States prioritized unilateralism, and various "reversal" on climate issues have greatly damaged the United States' international reputation and leadership and hindered the healthy development of international climate governance. Since taking office in 2021, President Biden has proposed ambitious legislation and expenditure in climate operation. However, no one can guarantee that Trump will not come back.</p>
<p>Under the situation of obvious geographical conflicts, fierce games of great powers, frequent security crisis, and the lack of leadership of deficit and lack of leadership, the trend of global warming has continued to increase. Encountered an unprecedented impact.</p>
<p><strong>Sino-US relations</strong></p>
<p>Sino -US relations are particularly valued. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in 1979, although bilateral relations have undulating relationships, after experiencing the crisis, they have always recovered their former diplomatic motivation and vitality.</p>
<p>Since Biden has taken office in the United States, China and the United States have frequently interacted. From the telephone summit of the leaders of the New Year's Eve in 2021, the Sino -US strategic dialogue in Ankrech in March, to the special envoys of the two parties in the Spring and Autumn Period, the consultations in Shanghai and Tianjin and the leaders of the two countries talked again in September, November China and the United States issued the Glasgow Joint Declaration at the 26th Conference of the Contract of the United Nations Climate Change Framework Convention. Either confrontation or negotiation, climate issues have never been absent, and advance in stumbling.<strong> Promote multilateral climate diplomacy </strong></p>
<p>Although China -US climate diplomacy has temporarily stagnated, since the signing of the Paris Agreement, China has been steadily promoted in the field of bilateral and multilateral climate diplomacy.</p>
<p>According to the information records of international exchanges and cooperation of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China has continuously expanded the exchanges in the climate field in the past few years. "The second China, Japan and South Korea Carbon neutralization forum" and other multilateral climate diplomacy.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has frequently interacted with many countries. There are 51 contents of the "People's Republic of China and the Republic of France" issued by the Chinese and French countries in April. , Laid a good foundation for the smooth development of climate diplomacy between the two countries, and put forward many specific operating matters. For example, Article 36 pointed out that China and France are willing to cooperate to solve the problem of financing difficulties in developing economies and emerging market economies, encourage them to accelerate energy and climate transformation, and support sustainable development. China will attend the Global Financing Contract Summit in Paris in June 2023 in Paris. The French party will attend the "Belt and Road" International Cooperation Summit Forum.</p>
<p>In April, China also issued the "China -Brazil's Joint Statement for Climate Change" with Brazil. A few of them are particularly worthy of attention, such as: China and Pakistan are determined to further strengthen multilateralism, including all partners of the "77 Country Group and China", with a view to establishing a collective, opposing unilateralism and green trade barriers, and and. Firmly based on a model of climate unity based on the unity of the international community; China -Pakistan has continued to urge developed countries to fulfill its obligations that have not yet fulfilled climate funds, and make a promise of new collective quantitative goals that are far higher than $ 100 billion per year, and put forward clear Adaptable to the fund diagram.</p>
<p><strong> Climate measures: from internal affairs to diplomacy </strong></p>
<p>The accurate evaluation of China's climate diplomacy and future trends is not only very important for China, but also as important for the process of global climate governance.</p>
<p>China is still a developing country. Economic and social development is uncoordinated, unbalanced, energy structure is partially coal, and its technological basic ability is weak. From 2012 to 2021, China supported the annual growth rate of 6.5%of its annual energy consumption growth rate. In this case, the huge efforts of China to achieve dual carbon targets are worth seeing and valued.</p>
<p>Looking back on the development and changes of climate issues in the journey of China's internal affairs and diplomacy, especially in recent years, in terms of institutional settings, personnel arrangements, capital investment, policy tilt, etc., they will find that although they are accompanied by some criticism and doubts. China still shows a initiative, responsible, and sustainable internal affairs and diplomacy in dealing with climate issues.</p>
<p>According to data from the National Energy Administration, at the end of 2022, China's new wind power, solar energy, and hydropower installed capacity far exceeded the capacity of new coal installation. At the same time, wind and solar power generation reached 1.19 trillion kWh, an increase of 21%year -on -year, accounting for 13.8%of the total power consumption. China's power generation structure is undergoing tremendous changes: In 2022, the proportion of coal power accounts for total power generation has decreased from 65-70%in the past to 58.4%, and the proportion of non-fossil energy power generation rose to 36.2%.</p>
<p>Recently, the joint statement of Sino -French and China -Pakistan has laid the tone of active cooperation. Can the outside world give China an objective and fair view and comment on the climate issues, whether it can see China ’s efforts and achievements in dealing with climate issues, and actively find cooperation points, grow up and make up for each other, so that the cooperation between each other is the main theme, and and the main theme of each other. The scope of cooperation in continuous deepening and expansion is very far -reaching. Only in this attitude of seeing and accepting each other, will there be more and more room for cooperation in China, and the future of global climate governance will be more bright and hopeful.</p>

<p>If one thing cannot be avoided, then it will definitely happen. Since 2022, the radical interest rate hikes of major central banks around the world have caused general concerns about the market for economic recession. But unlike market expectations, the European and American economies showed toughness in the first half of 2023, and the expected recession did not happen immediately. From the perspective of theoretical analysis and historical reality, the rapidly tightening monetary policy will definitely have a reflexive effect on economic growth, but the excess savings play a periodic buffer effect and delay the time of decline.</p>
<p>Through a comprehensive judgment of the global credit environment, monetary policy transmission, and economic fundamental changes, we believe that although the trend is delayed, from the end of 2023, the pressure of global economic recession will gradually enlarge, and it will follow the United States, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, The order of emerging market economies has continued to spread, and the global economy is facing challenges, and it is a rational choice to retain prudential prediction.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the global economy in the second half of the year, in the third quarter, considering that the excess savings of the European and American residents still remain nearly 1 trillion levels, this will continue to support the steady growth of private consumption in Europe and the United States in the short term. In terms of emerging markets, although the economic growth rate of most emerging market countries in the second half of 2022 in the second half of 2022 has continued to fall, most emerging market countries have slowed down in the first half of the year. Private consumption in Europe and the United States is stable, global trade chain is reshape, and China's economic recovery will still be repaired rapidly in the third quarter. Entering the fourth quarter, the overall credit contraction of the United States may lead to a downtreid cycle of the global economy.</p>
<p>Although a series of liquidity crises in European and American banks have occurred in a series of mitigation since 2023, at a high interest rate level, the bank's debt side has always faced the issue of deposit outflows. The recession of our simulation prediction predicts that at the end of the third quarter, as the deposit of American commercial banks continues to flow out, US industrial and commercial loans will start to decline first, and the pressure will be transmitted to commercial real estate loans. As the residential sector excess savings at the end of the fourth quarter, the resident Loans will also decline as a whole. In the end, the overall credit contraction may promote the United States into the decline cycle. When the United States takes the lead in entering the decline cycle, it will also overthrow the global Domino card, and global inflation will gradually fall at the end of the year or early next year. We predict that in the middle of the fourth quarter to the beginning of next year, the core inflation of the United States and Europe will decline by about 1.5 percentage points to 3.5%of the core inflation level, and the growth rate of inflation in the world's major emerging market countries will also be expected to decline by 1.0-1.5 percentage points during the year. The long -term trend of global inflation may be able to provide more currency and fiscal policy space for some emerging market countries. However, for countries that have been in vicious inflation for a long time (such as Argentina, Turkey), it is still difficult to solve the possibility of the outbreak of the currency crisis even if inflation to a mild growth range.</p>
<p><strong> The European and American economy will still be stable recently, and emerging markets will maintain recovery. </strong></p>
<p>Since 2022, under the influence of global high inflation, Europe and the United States and other developed countries and 43 developing countries around the world have launched interest rate hikes. However, for more than a year, the macro policies and the continuous increase in interest rate levels have not seem to have a substantial negative impact on the European and American economy. In the second quarter of 2023, from the current leading indicators of the European and American economic recession, most indicators continue to maintain stability. In the United States, although the growth rate of GDP in the second quarter was affected by the fluctuation of inventory investment, the actual economic growth rate was still higher than the potential economic growth rate of the Federal Reserve. Among them, more than 70%of the private consumption data contributed by GDP growth still remain steadily. Before the epidemic, the actual growth rate of the United States was less than 2%. After the epidemic, the actual growth rate of the United States had climbed to a level of 3.1%. The actual consumption expenditure, retail sales, month -on -month, new house sales, car sales, personal consumption expenditure and other advanced indicators also show that the overall consumption of the United States has still performed steadily since the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>In terms of euro zone, with the slowdown of the Ukraine War, the economies of the euro zone have entered the recovery channel. Although the growth rate of retail sales is still weak, the disposable income of residents has continued to increase, and consumers' confidence is fixed and fixed at the same time. In addition, China's economic recovery has also boosted the net export performance of the euro area. When the overall inflation level is still high, the overall increase of interest rate levels, and the long -term potential growth rate is still low, what is the reason why the European and American economy continues to maintain toughness in the short term?</p>
<p>First of all, under high interest rate conditions, major European and American economies can still maintain strong private consumption because of the excess savings settled in the residential sector are still abundant. The excess savings of the US residents are composed of three parts: 1) salary income; 2) fiscal support income (fiscal payment transfer income); 3) expenditure (consumption expenditure and other expenditures). Since the outbreak of the U.S. epidemic in 2020, the U.S. Treasury transferred to US residents account by the Federal Reserve to US $ 2.3 trillion. The recovery but also exacerbated inflation and deterioration. According to our estimates, the excess savings of the U.S. residential sector at the end of the first quarter of 2023 were still $ 1 trillion (4%of GDP), which continued to support the consumer expenditure of the residential department. At the same time, due to fiscal policy support, the monthly excess savings consumption of the American family sector narrowed from the previous period, resulting in a decrease in excess savings and retention consumption. Similarly, data from the European Central Bank showed that the excess savings of the residential department of the euro area still retained nearly 900 billion euros at the end of March 2023.</p>
<p>Secondly, the overall inflation significant downlink boosted the consumer purchasing power of the European and American residents. Entering the second quarter of 2023, due to the significant decline in energy and food inflation in Europe and the United States, the marginal improvement has improved the purchasing power of the European and American family departments in durable goods consumption, thereby ensuring the sustainability of service consumption purchasing power.</p>
<p>Finally, the problem of imbalance in the labor market in Europe and the United States still exists, and wage viscosity support service industry and manufacturing hours. The continuous shortage of labor and service industry's labor force supports the rapid growth of the hourly wages of manufacturing and core service departments. The increase in disposable income of residents has further alleviated the suppression of high inflation and high interest rates on purchasing power. On the whole, during the epidemic, the large-scale financial stimulus and currency over-issuing in Europe and the United States (nearly 20%of the currency growth rate of 20-21 years) are still supporting the current private consumption. The significant recession has not substantially arrived. In the third quarter of 2023, private consumption in Europe and the United States will still be stable, which will support the actual GDP in Europe and the United States to maintain a growth rate of 1.9%and 1%year -on -year (Table 1).Figure 1: Global actual GDP growth forecast % %</p>

<p><strong> Credit contraction at the end of the year may lead to the global economy entering the decline cycle. </strong></p>
<p>Although a series of liquidity crises in European and American banks have eased in a series of liquidity crises since 2023, the Fed's balance sheet has resumed shrinkage since March, and U.S. SMB's super -storage funds have gradually rebounded, but the liquidity crisis of small and medium -sized banks seems to have not ended. Specifically, the temporary "blood transfusion" policy cannot solve the fundamental problem. Whether it is a discount window operation (DW) or a bank regular financing plan (BTFP) directly providing loans to small and medium banks, while the currency market interest rate continues to be high (April's currency market interest rate range is 4.5-5%) The bank liabilities will always face the issue of deposit outflow. Even if the Federal Reserve has suspended interest rate hikes, the continuity of the high interest rate level will gradually conduct the affecting the credit market. Once the bank credit conditions accelerate the deterioration, the loan of the corporate and residential departments will be contracted, and the financial stability will be significantly impacted. Essence Judging from the current data, although commercial loans from the US residents and corporate departments remain steadily, it reflects that the overall credit expansion of the United States has not signs significant narrowing. However, we believe that the possibility of significant credit contraction in the United States in the fourth quarter is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>First of all, Bank of America's industrial and commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in the fourth quarter may accelerate downward. On the one hand, the risk of liquidity compensation of deposits has always existed, and the exit of deposits will conduct conduction that affects the growth of loans. Although the crisis of small and medium -sized banks in the United States has been resolved since May, the scale of US commercial bank deposits continued to decline in May, and the pressure on the outflow of deposits of small and medium -sized banks has always existed. Not only that, the scale of deposits of large banks also declined significantly in mid -May, showing that the outflow of the deposit of small and medium -sized banks is further transmitting the risk of liquidity supplementation of large banks. On the other hand, the overall loan scale of small and medium -sized banks in the United States accounts for 80%of the deposit scale. Among them, industrial and commercial loans and commercial real estate loans accounted for more than 50%of total loans. From the perspective of historical data, the continuous outflow of bank deposits will accelerate the decline in industrial and commercial loans, further transmitting the decline in commercial real estate loans, thereby substantially affecting economic activities.</p>
<p>Secondly, residents' excess savings are expected to be exhausted at the end of the fourth quarter, driving consumer loans to a significant decline. From the perspective of historical data, residents' excess savings and consumer loans are significantly positive. The current U.S. tax policy continues to support US households to receive $ 75 billion in excess savings per quarter. Based on our estimates, if the US consumption expenditure continues to maintain the average growth rate before the epidemic, the excess savings of about $ 60-700 billion will be consumed in the next two quarters (Figure 3). Considering the impact of consumers' expectations on consumer behavior, we expect that the credit of the US residents at the end of this year will accompany the excess savings to the bottom and fall significantly. In summary, industrial and commercial loans are the first to decline, and commercial real estate loans have further declined. The final decline in residential loans will lead to continuous contraction of overall credit and continuously weakening the stability of the US financial market. 4).</p>
<p>If the United States enters the decline cycle due to the deterioration of credit conditions at the end of the fourth quarter or at the end of the fourth quarter, it is expected that the Fed will begin to release interest rate cuts in the fourth quarter to actively respond to the risk of recession in advance. The decline of the US economy will further conduct further to varying degrees of transmission to affect Europe, Japan and emerging market economies. Considering the lag of European credit and US credit conditions, the impact of credit tightening in the euro area on economic activities (consumption and investment) will appear in mid -2024. It is expected that in the first quarter of next year, the credit support of the euro zone bank to the family and the enterprise department will begin to weaken. The Japanese economy is expected to be impacted by foreign demand with the approaching European and American economy. It is not realistic to implement a tightening policy on the basis of the rate of yield curve control. Maintaining the loose monetary policy will continue during the year.</p>

<p>Each country must make difficult choices when facing economic difficulties. Economic theory and economic intuition may not always return to the same way. Local debt and real estate seem to be high -risk, but the policy is intentional. It releases financial risks through administrative Canadian markets and strengthens the constraints of local governments. The real risk comes from the failure side of the demand side. Public expenditure cannot keep up with the speed of production capacity accumulation. Rest reduction can improve the balance sheet, but it does not create new demand. To get rid of liquidity trap, you need to create inflation expectations.</p>
<p>The government report in 2023 clearly pointed out the two major risks of the Chinese economy: real estate and local government debt. The risk of real estate is individuality. It is difficult for developers with high debt strokes, but the impact of real estate companies that pay attention to quality of quality will be less. On the contrary, local debt is only systematic risk and has no individual risks. The market's belief in urban investment bonds is based on the trust of the government. Once a certain urban urban investment bond has a substantial breach of contract, then urban investment bonds in all regions will be risked by selling.</p>
<p><strong>real estate</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, the regulatory authorities launched the "three red lines" policy to demand deleveraging real estate companies. The liquidity of the housing market is gradually exhausted, many housing companies have broken capital chain, and residential transactions have declined. The primary goal of real estate regulation is to stabilize house prices. This was the most prominent performance in 2022: the annual commercial housing transactions fell by 28%, the transaction volume of the top 100 housing companies fell by 40%, but the price of new houses did not fall. There are no similar restrictions on the second -hand housing market, and second -hand housing prices in various regions are fulfilled. Therefore, the arbitrage between first -hand houses and second -hand housing markets appear in some places, which has increased difficulties to regulation of real estate.</p>
<p>If house prices are free to adjust, it may stimulate demand or open a depression. The experience of developed countries is the lesson of the front car. The results of the spontaneous adjustment of the market are often unpredictable. American experience is positive. After the 2007 subprime crisis, US house prices fell 20%in two years. However, it has been rising all the way, and it has reached a record high in 2022. House prices have doubled more than 2009. But Japan's experience is negative. The Japanese housing market collapsed in 1991, and the price fell by half in 2009, and has not been able to return to the high point in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the commercial housing market in 1998, China's real estate has gone through 25 years of expansion. Most of the cities have high inventory and have lost population. The birth rate of the population that has decreased too fast and the slowdown urbanization has lowered the future housing demand. The launch of real estate tax in the future will pull the house prices lower. Since the launch of the reform of "Housing and Living", since its launch in 2016, it has not shifted through several economic downward pressures. At present, the market's expected return of long -term housing prices returns rationality. In the next few years, more real estate companies will be cleared, and existing inventory will be exhibited or re -positioning will accelerate.</p>
<p><strong> Local government debt </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-11T15-11-11-00-00/000183996_piclink.png" />Olivierblanchard, a macroeconomist, has proposed that government debt interest rates are less than economic growth (ie, less than G). For the United States, this relationship was briefly broken in the 1980s. High debt does mean higher interest payment, but for solvency, it is important not the absolute level of debt, but the debt level relative to the tax base. After World War II, US debt continued to increase, but the government did not do any special operations to pay debt. It was just due to GDP growth and inflation, the debt resolved itself. China's situation is similar. Government debt yields have been lower than the growth rate of GDP, and there are only short -term deviations in the early stage of the epidemic.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-11T15-11-11-00-00/000183997_piclink.png" />Under normal circumstances, the internal debt of the sovereign state will not constitute a real financial risk. If government debt is dominated by foreign debt, the period of economic turmoil will affect currency value and capital flow, which may trigger a financial crisis. But domestic bonds will always be diluted with economic growth. There is a fundamental difference between government bonds and personal debt. Personally, you have to pay for bonds when you are income. However, the government exists almost forever, and the income is sustainable. The taxes of almost all countries have continued to grow over time. The government must pay debt interest, but it does not have to be paid off, and new debts can also be issued to replace the old debt. In the early 19th century, Britain issued permanent bonds to support the Napoleonic War. It has always paid interest but never needs to repay the principal. China has shown a similar style in the past few times of urban investment bond operations: In early 2023, Zunyi, Guizhou, announced that it was reorganized for the RMB 15.6 billion. It was postponed for 20 years. Loan banks have to accept bad debt exhibition periods. I am afraid that many risks of urban investment bonds will be resolved in a similar way in the future.</p>
<p>However, urban investment bonds have no individual risks, only systemic risks. Urban investment bonds are issued for infrastructure. The return rate of infrastructure projects is extremely low. In 2019, it was 2%, only 1.3%in 2022, and the return on investment in the same period was about 5%. If you only look at the return on investment, no one will buy a city debt. The reason why urban investment bonds can still be sold is because the market believes in the government. In 2018, the Xinjiang Construction Corps Sixth Division had a technical default and became the first default city investment bond, but it was paid a week later. The central government has always emphasized that it is necessary to keep the bottom line that does not occur without the financial crisis, and once it is broken, it will trigger a systemic financial crisis. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that the investment bonds in Kunming, Guiyang or Shandong will have a substantial default. The intention of supervision to regulate the financing platform is very clear, and it will also use more market -oriented methods to make financial constraints on local governments.</p>
<p><strong> Is there a solution for short -term growth? </strong></p>
<p>After the epidemic, the market had high expectations for the economic rebound. However, rebuilding confidence is a long -term process, and short -term policy emphasizes control risks and employment. From the beginning of the year, the fundamentals have improved, but the problem of insufficient internal demand has gradually emerged. After the leadership, the currency finance did not make efforts.</p>
<p>During the economic downturn, the private sector usually reduces employees and increases efficiency, lowering costs and expenses. The government still needs to invest in public projects for financial expenditures, which drives everyone's willingness to consume and invest. Urban Investment Corporation has undertaken the role of secondary finance in the past many years. Because most private enterprises in China cannot obtain bank loans. Urban investment companies engage in infrastructure, as long as the project can start, it can release liquidity to private enterprises.</p>
<p>The current dilemma is that there are not many projects. After 2008, a package stimulus plan was mainly realized through infrastructure investment, which led to China's infrastructure level far beyond the emerging market with equivalent income. At the same time, the degree of automation of infrastructure is getting higher and higher. Even if fiscal expenditure can effectively stimulate GDP growth, the effect of employment is getting worse and worse.In contrast, the United States has adopted less peaceful versions to stimulate the economy. After the Great Depression of 1929 and 1933, domestic demand was always half-warm. Later, the reason why he could get out of the predicament was to rely on the US government to invest in large public projects. This project was World War II. Government expenditures have become real military products and civil products, and exports to Europe have also risen. In the process, the US dollar replaced the pound as an international reserve currency.</p>
<p>In simple terms, deficit expenditures are still important. Even if infrastructure space decreases or local debt burden rises, it is impossible to stop extra public expenditures. Because this is the most direct and effective means to fight against recession. Some people think that public investment will squeeze private investment, leading to the retreat of the country and the people. However, the low interest rate environment indicates that the return on investment in the private sector is very low, which shows that more resources for private investment will not drive economic growth. Therefore, the extrusion effect of private investment should not be the main concern of deficit expenditure.</p>
<p><strong> Be alert to liquidity trap </strong></p>
<p>In the face of recession, the response to monetary policy is usually interest rate cuts. The situation in China this year is unusual. Even if interest rates cut interest, it cannot stimulate the economy, that is, it is trapped in a wide range of liquidity traps. Market confidence has not recovered from the epidemic. 2023 will be a year of emotional dominance. Among them, there will be unrealistic expectations, dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the pessimism brought about by the decline of expectations. The severe employment situation can make many people feel nervous about the future. As a result, we see high savings and low investment.</p>
<p>At the policy level, encouraging private consumption and investment is still the most realistic choice. But how to inspire people to spend money? The answer to economics is to create inflation. Inflation is expected to reduce the actual value of the currency, the enthusiasm of the people holding the currency decreases, and the motivation to spend money will increase. That is, only by creating an inflation environment can we finally get rid of the trap of liquidity. However, people who advocate inflation must fight with deep -rooted concepts, because it is generally believed that price stability is more important.</p>
<p>Although we cannot mistake the short -term economic fluctuations as long -term growth trends, the risk of insufficient domestic demand is real. In the past ten years, the focus of China's economic policy has shifted from the demand side to the supply side, which aims to improve economic security and production efficiency. However, the current risk is that if domestic demand does not last too long, it may be transformed into depression, and it will be quite difficult to reverse the trend at that time. After all, Japan has tried to improve domestic inflation expectations for 20 years.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT became a phenomenon -level application and brought unprecedented impact. AI entrepreneurial heat that has been calm quickly heats up, AIGC(AI generation content)The huge entrepreneurial opportunities brought people excited. At the same time, a series of issues such as copyright, academic incompetence, discrimination, data security, and being abused on fraud, rumors, and forgery of identity have also become the focus of social attention. Understanding and solving the ethical issues in these innovation and entrepreneurship are both business. The focus of ethics, the focus of the development of new technologies, is also the core content that entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial enterprises continue to explore and reflect on ethical levels in practice.</p>
<p><strong> The contradiction between the complexity of entrepreneurial ethics and the simplification of ethical decision -making </strong></p>
<p>As an important part of human civilization and social order, both in developed or developing countries are emphasizing the importance of ethics. However, the status quo in practice is not optimistic. With the advancement of technological and economic and social development, the world's new trends, new things, and new technologies have impacted human ethics. Especially for the general lack of ethical education of entrepreneurs, their understanding, reflection and construction are often seriously lagging. This has brought difficulties to the development of the discipline of entrepreneurial ethics, but also raised some deeper and future issues.</p>
<p>Today China is a developing country that is still in transformation. There are many characteristics of traditional society, but also many problems of modernization. At the same time, due to the development of the Internet and personal entrepreneurship, many post -modern society has been present. Traditional society is a acquaintance society and human society, and a face -to -face society. It pays more attention to the traditional moral norms. China is particularly particular about "enrolling in the law" in history. Modern society pays attention to rules and interests, and pursues the spirit of rationality and contract. "Four modernizations" and "two hundred years" are both China's realization and grand strategy that are realized in the process of modernization. Later, modern society is a state of facts and creation, and value as the orientation, which breaks the rules and hangs the state of "truth" and meaning. The characteristics of these three society coexist, deal with different morality and interests, and face different ethical dilemma and ethical issues, have different ideas and methods, contradictions and confusion are abound, and it also makes China's ethical and moral issues particularly complicated. Essence</p>
<p>It is particularly important that the characteristics of postmodern society currently presented are directly related to entrepreneurial ethics. Postmodernism is concerned about non -linear expressiveness and richness, as well as transcendence of rational thoughts. With the rapid development of the Internet and various information technologies, the characteristics of openness, online, decentralization, large -scale collaboration, and long tails are present, which has enabled the most suitable development space of postmodernism. It is a post -modern lifestyle. As Intel's founder Glusov said, "Only paranoia can survive", this is an era of geeks, hackers, and makers like fish and shining. Many traditional theories have lost their understanding, breaking the wealth created by the conventional, and making some traditional experience seem to lose its charm. Wang Jianlin, Ma Yun, Dong Mingzhu and Lei Jun's two -time betting at the CCTV Finance Channel's annual financial figures' awards ceremony have also become an important iconic event. But one of the negative effects is to eliminate the meaning of traditional values, "all strong things have disappeared", and even many entrepreneurs lack the minimum awe of morality.</p>
<p>Just as economist Xiong Peter gives two attributes: "creation" and "destruction" based on the two sides of entrepreneurship. There is both contradictions between entrepreneurship and ethics and restricting each other. In the context of the era of entrepreneurship, this dialectical unified relationship makes the moral problems facing entrepreneurs more complicated. solution.</p>
<p>Although entrepreneurial ethics is essentially blurred and complex, human instinctual response is to go straight to the goal linear thinking. In the long -term test -oriented education, the way of thinking "without making mistakes", "precision" and "only answer" is continuously strengthened. In the long -term instruction economy and administrative thinking, this instinctive linear thinking and the habitual thinking of test -oriented education have been further deepened and solidified. In some traditional and grass -roots jobs, the factors considers the personal behavior decision -making are very limited. It seems that it does not seem to be a big deal according to the instinct's straight -line thinking. However, in market areas with fierce competition and rapid development and changes, especially in extremely high -risk entrepreneurial activities, there are no non -linear, dynamic, and power -changing analysis and decision -making capabilities, and even the complex thinking of interdisciplinary. The ethical issues that should be treated seriously, let alone make objective, correct and favorable judgments and decisions. For example, although it is not uncommon to lose money before making money in the field of entrepreneurship, large -scale and long -term burning money like the Internet is anti -instinct and anti -intuitive. According to the traditional attitude, the money of investing in investors is not morally based on a long -term profit. However, this new economy that loses money has brought the fastest exponential growth opportunities and countless business myths in human history, so that people who follow linear thinking have completely missed this epoch -making opportunity. The "non -black or white" thinking is not enough to open up. Many people have lost their opportunities for entrepreneurship, and they have missed the excellent opportunities given by many times.</p>
<p><strong> The meaning of "Gray Law" </strong></p>
<p>"Everything is made, and only has high reading." According to the general logic, it is undoubtedly a more important values to complete the academic logic, but there will be some different results in the golden age of the entrepreneurial of information technology. Throughout the world's leaders in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship, there are many star figures who have dropped out of school, such as the Larry Ex Sen who founded Oracle, Bill Gates, Microsoft, Steve Jobs founded by Apple, founding Facebook Chen Shijun, who founded YouTube, founded Youtube. Moreover, Facebook has its unique standards for recruiting talents. They are inclined to hire young people. For those who drop out of school, challenge old customs, and self -study, drop out of school is a virtue. "When you can participate in it, why waste time to study it?" Zardberg would ask him to try to recruit graduates. He even began to guarantee that if someone dropped out of school to work, he decided to go to study again in the future. In the case, the company will pay tuition for it.</p>
<p>There is also a high school in China to start a business. The entrepreneurs who do not go to college are typical, that is, Li Xiang, who has established bubble nets, car homes, and ideal cars. He described "Before I was 18 years old, my academic performance was in the middle and lower, and my relatives and relatives felt that I had nothing to do in the future. At that time, like many classmates, I followed the flow, full of right and wrong, but there was no action to change my destiny."</p>
<p>The change of entrepreneurship to him is definitely greater than that of college. Zhang Yong, the founder and chairman of Haidilao, the largest market value of China's catering industry, is just a technical secondary school student. This book is not encouraging blind dropouts and entrepreneurship, and it is not even recommended for college students to start a business directly. However, in the situation of entrepreneurship, maintaining entrepreneurial passion reflects a kind of values, so that it is necessary to focus on opportunities, and to make every effort to turn opportunities into results. At least, this is a more tolerant culture. Behind it is the opportunity to grasp the opportunity under the trend of the intensity of human innovation and entrepreneurship and the concentration of success rates.Coincidentally, Tencent also has a similar "gray law". On July 9, 2012, at the first anniversary of the Tencent Partner Conference, Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent's board of directors and CEO, sent an open letter Seven dimensions of the law of degree: specifically include demand, speed, flexibility, redundant degree, openness collaboration, innovation, evolution, etc. (see the introduction of the second chapter), although it is more focused on "product innovation and enterprise enterprises Management ", but still reflects non -linear and complex thinking that is in line with" postmodern characteristics ".</p>
<p>In terms of generality, ethics can be divided into two views: moral absoluteism and moral relativism. For entrepreneurial ethics, it is necessary to pay special attention to morality. In the eyes of a successful entrepreneur, there is no eternal moral value concept and principles that are generally applicable at any time or place. It is not necessary to treat the ethics that do not meet modern work and entrepreneurship. For the new ethical concepts that are in line with the characteristics of the future and will be included in the new human civilization, we must maintain a certain degree of openness and tolerance.</p>
<p>As Jobs said: "People have limited time, so don't live according to the wishes of others. This is a waste of time. Don't be in prejudice, that is to live according to the results of others. After your own voice, the most important thing is to have the courage to follow your own feelings and intuition. "</p>

<p>Many people in Malaysia find that it is difficult to apply for Indonesian helpers. The Indonesian Embassy in Malaysia revealed that in the past year, a total of 8,129 Indonesian people applied for the helper job of Malaysia, but the Malaysian government only approved 4,400 of them. The Indonesian government pays deep attention to the approval rate of less than 5.5%.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Ambassador to Malaysia, Hemo, told the Daily News that the above data shows that there is a big gap between the Indonesian helper applicants and the approved by the Malaysian government. "We question why only 4,400 applications have been applied for more than 80,000 applications. (Application and approval) The gap between the two."</p>
<p>Hemo said about 4,400 approved applications, about 2,300 people have arrived in Malaysia. "We think the approval procedure must be accelerated to prevent employers from hiring Indonesian helpers in an illegal way, and thus cause the problem of illegal helper." He also said that after Saudi Arabia re -open foreign workers to enter the country, the Indonesian people actually wanted to go to Saudi Arabia to become a helper.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Malaysia signed the "Recruitment and Memo Memorandum of Understanding in Indonesia's Family Gang Gangs" on April 1 last year. The two countries agreed to use a single channel to screen employers who really meet the qualifications of hiring home helpers.</p>

<p>Reuters quoted official data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China this Sunday that only 6.83 million newcomers registered for marriage last year, a decrease of about 800,000 pairs last year. According to the Chinese media's First Financial Statistics, this data set the lowest level since the Ministry of Civil Affairs's website announced the relevant statistics in 1986. Compared with the highest peak in 2013, the number of married people in China has decreased by 49.3%over the past nine years.</p>
<p>The Chinese population declined for the first time in 60 years last year, and this situation has a profound impact on the "dividends" that maintain China's labor -intensive economic model. According to official statistics, the birth rate of China's population decreased from 7.52 per 1,000 people in 2021 to 6.77, a record lowest. As of now, in order to make up for the downturn of fertility, many provinces have even proposed to extend paid marriage leave to young newlyweds. However, the above -mentioned data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Chinese Civil Affairs highlight that the relevant measures have not produced an instant effect.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted the population to warn that with the decrease in labor and liabilities, local governments with liabilities increased their expenditures in their elderly population, and China would grow old before wealthy.</p>

<p>The survey shows that more than one -third of men in Germany believe that the violence of women is "acceptable."</p>
<p>The survey conducted by the Internet from March 9th to 21st showed that 33%of the German men aged 18 to 35 believed that they occasionally "hand -slip" when quarreling with female partners. 34%of the respondents acknowledged that they had treated women violently.</p>
<p>Karstenkassner, which advocates gender -equal umbrella "Federal FORUM MEN", described that the survey results were "shocking". In an interview with the German media group Funke, he said: "One -third of the investigations were investigated by men and the violence against women. This is a problem. This situation urgently needs to change."</p>
<p>The survey was commissioned by the Plan International General of the International Association of Children's Assistance Organization. The investigation object was 1,000 men and 1,000 women aged 18 to 35.</p>
<p>The survey also found that 52%of men believe that they play the role of the main supporters in their relationship with their partners, and the other party should be responsible for taking care of housework.</p>
<p>Alexandra Tschacher, a spokesman for the International Pei Young Society, pointed out: "Traditional gender characters are still deeply ingrained in people's hearts."</p>
<p>According to data from the German Federal Police, more than 115,000 women in the country were violent by partners in 2021, that is, 13 women were killed per hour. In 2021, 301 women in Germany died in the hands of their current or predecessors.</p>
<p>German Justice Bushman said last year that such violence should not be diluted into "personal tragedies" and showed that it would promote legal reforms and be punished more severe punishment for female perpetrators.</p>

<p>(Voice of German in Chinese) A spokesman of the European Commission said on Monday (June 5) that a report from market participants received possible fraud reports involved some sustainable biofuels that have been certified.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that the European Commission was cooperating with state -to -laws and investigating these suspected cases with national cooperation. He also said that as the investigation is in progress, the number of imports will not be provided.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the matter said the complaint was proposed by Germany.</p>
<p>Bio -fuel is made of animal or plant waste. For example, it is made of vegetable oil, farm by -products, animal fat, etc. Bio -fuel is considered more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels.</p>
<h3>Garbage into fuel</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the European Commission said that fuel suppliers operate fossil fuels and biofuels in the international market. The European Commission "invites all economic actors to participate in the biofuel market to fully investigate and report any suspicious situation." He said: "The European Union treats any scams very seriously and will take appropriate action without hesitation to protect the integrity of its biofuel market."</p>
<p>The biofuel industry organization "European Waste and Advanced Biofee Fuel Association" (EWABA), in a letter sent to the European Commission and the German government last week, talked about the "terrible" situation caused by Chinese biological diesel imports to the European Union. The letter said that the exports of biological diesel in China have recently increased, which is considered to have possible fraud, and this situation "suppresses the entire EU's biological diesel market" and leads to the closure of relevant factories.</p>
<p>This letter also stated that only by waste, "sustainability and traceability is the unquestionable" biofuel, can it be promoted in the European Union. The letter said that unless the containment measures are adopted and a voluntary certificate of the use of suspicious fuel restrictions from countries outside the EU, "we will soon embark on an irreversible path, which will eventually lead to the entire collapse of the EU industry."</p>
