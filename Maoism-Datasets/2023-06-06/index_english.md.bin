(Voice of Germany Chinese website) After the US -China warship almost collided on the weekend in the Taiwan Strait, the White House said on Monday (June 5) that China and other countries have recently been in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Increasingly, the risk of "injury" is increased.

White House spokesman Johnkirby said: "Unfortunately, we are dealing with the increasingly aggressive situation of China, and this is only part of it. We are also ready to talk about this problem." Cerbin said that "someone will be injured for a long time without a long time", and unprofessional and unsafe interceptions may lead to "misjudgment or make mistakes."

Cerbone said that if China wants to convey that the United States is unpopular in the region or wants US aircraft and ships to stop sailing in the area, it will not succeed.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on the 5th that "China has always respects the rights of navigation and flying over by countries in accordance with international law" and emphasized that the "truth" of this matter is "the United States is provocative, and China is dealt with in accordance with laws and regulations." He also asked, why the "unsafe" incident in the United States occurred in the leader and the sea of China, instead of the airspace of other countries and the near the sea?

### China -U.S. warship meets the Taiwan Strait

### Expert: Taiwan Strait's tight situation may be "prelude to discussion"

Robert Daly, director of the Institute of Sino -US Institute in the United States, analyzed that the incident showed that the existence of the United States in the region made China think it was a provocation. "

He said that China's statement did not mention the incident in the international waters. According to the 2016 Ruling of the United Nations Marine Law and the permanent arbitration court, China's territorial claims in the region were not legal. Therefore, in the end, the matter will eventually become the controversy of which the "international law" and "the sovereignty of the country supported by international law."

However, Dali also said that the reason why China has this behavior may be "hoping to show its position more clearly" as a "prelude to discussion" as China and the United States. He suggested that if the United States wants to promote the dialogue between the two sides, it may consider "canceling the sanctions against the Chinese Minister of Defense Li Shangfu."

### China -U.S.

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command issued a statement on Saturday (3rd) that the USS Chung-Hoon and the Harry Fax-class patrol ship "HMCSMONTREAL" (HMCSMONTREAL) and Harry Fax, Canada, Through the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese missile destroyer "Suzhou" (PRC LY132 "suddenly cut into the Chomuni channel in the United States in the" unsafe way ", forcing the Zhong Yun to decelerate to avoid collision.

The statement states that the closest distance between the two ships is only 150 yards (137 meters), and the Chinese military's behavior violates the "road rules" at sea with the safety of international waters.

Canada Montello Commander Paul Mountford told the Canadian GlobalNews that first reported the matter. "U.S. ship personnel responded to demanding that Chinese warships stay away.

He said that the Chinese army was notified by radio, obviously to deliberately cross the provocation; and the US -Canada warships sailed in the international waters, and the Chinese warships continued to warn them that they were driving into China's territorial sea. He hopes that this is just a case. In the future, it will not happen to Canadian warships. "Because we have international law as the basis, this is the international waters."

"" Some out -of -domain countries "are based on the name of freedom of navigation, and the hegemony of sailing. If we want to confuse the South China Sea, we need to make a high degree of vigilance and resolutely resist it." He said that Chinese military aircraft and warships will never go to other countries to lead the air and be near the sea to do the so -called "navigation hegemony". "The best way is to manage their own warships and control their planes."

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also shouted Beijing on the 4th: "Do the right thing and control the behavior of its troops."

The Ministry of Defense of Taiwan stated on the 3rd that the relevant situation was grasped throughout the process, and in order to protect the Taiwan Strait's security and stability, it has been applied to the monitoring of the sea and air forces. The Taiwanese party calls on the Chinese authorities to respect the right to navigation, avoid excessive provocations, and jointly maintain the peace and stability and security of the region.

Reuters reports that this offshore encounter is the latest close -range contact of the Chinese and American military. Less than a week ago, the U.S. Indo -Pacific Command said that [a Chinese fighter aircraft approached the US military aircraft on May 26 in the South China Sea, and conducted a "unnecessary attack"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/南海較勁美稱中國戰鬥機逼近挑釁攔截/a-65775811)Essence

Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, did not comment on military aircraft incidents at the time. It only stated that the United States "frequently dispatched aircraft and ships and carried out near -reconnaissance against China", which seriously threatened China's national security.

### White House: Maintain the stable dynamics of the Taiwan Strait

U.S. -China relations have encountered a historical trough, since February "[spy balloon](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國氣球能實時回傳信號美無法證實/a-65222124)Since the incident, conflicts have been constantly, and recently have been almost in conflict with the Chinese military in the sea and airspace, and the tension has continued to rise. In this regard, the White House national security adviser Jakesullivan (CNN) program "Fareed Zakariagps" on the 4th on the 4th, the United States is seeking to maintain a "stable" stable The two sides of the Strait "."

Shalvin said that the Bayeng government has repeatedly stated that its cross -strait relations policies have not changed, and they are still based on the "One China Policy" and the "Taiwan Relations Law". The United States supports that "Taiwan or China will not change the status quo unilaterally."

Shalvin also said in an interview that US -China relations have gone through extremely turbulent and nervous year, and the two countries are also working hard to return to normal relations. US president Joebiden may meet with Xi Jinping at a "point in time": "I hope that in the next few months, we can see high -level China -US high -level contact in the next few months to continue this work (referring to the restoration of the relationship between the two countries).

Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu also said in Shangri -La dialogue in Singapore on the 4th that China -US conflict will be a "unbearable pain in the world". Faced with the relationship between the two countries, China sought dialogue rather than confrontation.

###  upgrade

After the United States shot down China's suspected spy balloon, the tension between the United States and China further intensified. This time, the Minister of Defense of China had rejected the US Secretary of Defense Austin to discuss matters related to balloons. China claims that the U.S. shot down is an over -reaction and violates international standards. The U.S. Department of Commerce will add 6 entities related to Beijing's suspected spy ball plan to be on the blacklist of exports. In the past few days, the U.S. military has shot down three flying bodies over the Alas California Coast in northwestern United States, Yakong areas in northwestern Canada, and the overhead of the US -Canada border.

### China Defense Minister Lee Shangfu Shangri -La Dialogue released a comprehensive tough signal

June 5, 2023![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-05T09-44-37.000Z/_129988630_gettyimages-1258416937.jpg)Image source, AFP

Image adding text,

Li Shangfu served as the Minister of Defense in March.

** Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu delivered a major speech at the Shangri -La dialogue after taking office. It mentioned that if a fierce conflict between China and the United States, it will be the "unbearable pain" in the world. **

At this summit in the field of security defense, Li Shangfu pointed out that "some countries" are intensifying arms competitions in Asia.

However, he said that the world is large enough and can accommodate the common development of China and the United States. The two superpowers should seek a win -win situation in cooperation.

In his speech, Li Shangfu did not mention the United States directly, but said that "some countries want to intervene in other domestic affairs and regional affairs."

He said that China "never" allows the United States to launch the "Color Revolution" and the agent war in multiple regions to repeat itself in the Asia -Pacific region.

The United States had previously accused the Chinese destroyer's "unsafe" operation when a US warship was approaching a US warship.

On Saturday (June 3), the U.S. Navy pointed out that a Chinese destroyer sailed near a U.S. warship "in an unsafe way. At that time, the US warships were passing the Taiwan Strait with Canadian ships.

China has criticized the United States and Canada to "intentionally create incidents, deliberately provoke risks, and maliciously destroy regional peace and stability." Meijia claims that he sails within the allowable range of international law.

In his speech, he said that China would not allow the United States and its allies to "sail hegemony in the name of navigation freedom" in the South China Sea.

Last week, Washington announced a video that the Chinese fighter plane approached the US military aircraft with the "unnecessary provocative" action in the South China Sea.

### China "is not afraid of any opponent" on the issue of Taiwan

When asked about the Taiwan Strait issue, Li Shangfu said that it was the tension of "foreign countries" intensifying the region.

He reiterated that the Taiwan issue is the core of China's "core interests", and any "blur" and a Chinese principle behavior is "absurd and dangerous."

Image adding text,

The Taiwan issue has continued to become a contradiction in Sino -US relations.

He criticized the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party to "conspire alone", and the external forces "controlled the Taiwan China" to interfere with China's internal affairs, saying that this was the root cause of the tension of the Taiwan Strait.

"We are willing to strive for peace and reunification with the greatest sincerity, but never promise to give up the use of force," Li Shangfu said. "If someone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will not hesitate to be hesitant and not afraid of any opponent. No matter how much the price is paid, it will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. "

### Criticizing the "Cold War Thinking" in the United States

Li Shangfu, who served as China Defense Director in March this year, accused the United States of "Cold War Thinking" and "caused a great increase in security risks."

He mentioned the "Indo -Pacific Strategy" proposed by the United States, saying that China believes that any strategy can "draw lines with ideology" and build his military alliance with "threatening threat".

He also pointed out that the essence of trying to promote the "Asia -Pacific NATO" is to abduct the countries of the region and rendering conflict confrontation, which will only cause this area to fall into the vortex of tearing, disputes and conflicts.

###

Li Shangfu made the above remarks when attending the Shangri -La dialogue in Singapore. This is the only annual safety defense summit in the Asia -Pacific region.

The United States imposed sanctions on Li Shangfu on the issue of Russian weapons in 2018. In order to protest, Beijing has recently rejected the request for the dialogue between the two national defense ministers.

Image adding text,

Li Shangfu, the Chinese Defense Director, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2018, rejected the invitation to meet with the US Defense Minister Austin.

At the Singapore summit, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin accused China of refusing to conduct military discussions.

A member of the Chinese delegation told AFP that the U.S. relief of sanctions against Li Shangfu was a prerequisite for dialogue.

Some experts said that neither the United States and China were interested in truly communicating with each other.

### U.S. Defense Criticism criticized China

Earlier, Austin delivered a speech entitled "The United States' Leadership in the Indo -Pacific Region" at the Shangri -La Dialogue Summit, which was "deeply concerned" about China's unwillingness to participate in military crisis management.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-05T09-44-37.000Z/_129975555_austin.jpg)Image source, EPA

Image adding text,

US Secretary of Defense Austin said, "The more we talk about, the more you can avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment that may cause crisis or conflict."

He emphasized that the Taiwan Strait War will be devastating and will "affect the global economy in a way we can't imagine."

He criticized that China "alarmed the number of dangerous interceptions on the United States and allies aircraft in the international airspace, and reiterated that the United States would support allies and partners to fight against" coercion and bullying. "

He also pointed out that the United States is firmly committed to maintaining the current situation of Taiwan.In recent years, Washington and Beijing have experienced tensions on a series of issues, including China ’s sovereignty on Taiwan and the sovereignty dispute over the South China Sea.

China's sovereignty in the South China Sea is a major issue in the security issue in the Asia -Pacific region.

### Meeting with British and German Defense

During the summit on the weekend, Li Shangfu held bilateral talks with Britain, German defense and EU representatives.

Josep Borrell, a senior representative of EU diplomacy and security policy, said that the two sides had a constructive dialogue, and German Defense Minister Borispistorius called on China to stop recruiting German retired pilots for training for Chinese combat pilots.

The German Defense Minister told AFP that Li Shangfu did not deny the statement during the talks, but tried to dilute the importance of this incident from his perspective.

In addition, Li Shangfu also had talks with the British Minister of Defense BenWallace, which showed the Chinese side to the Chinese side's views on issues such as Hong Kong's democratic movement, freedom of navigation, Uyghur human rights, and Taiwan Straits.

****

** "Express the Communist Party!Express Xi Jinping!" **

The public shouted the slogan -this is the June 4th rally of the city center of Sydney on June 4. About 200 people at the scene include many young people. The post -00 students studying at the University of Sydney are one of them. He was dressed as a Voonie in the dragon robe, standing publicly on a inflatable tank car.

"We should never forgive the people's regime to the people's regime."

He was persecuted because of participating in the "Manchurian Independence Movement", and then the post -90s young man Wu Tong, who was then protected by Australian asylum, came to the scene with the Manchurian flag. Wu Tong mentioned to this station that she used to understand the June 4th incident through the wall; she came to mourn to defend historical memory. she says:

"8964 cannot be forgotten, but also witnessed the CCP's atrocities; some readers need to support us against the CCP's atrocities. So, let's participate in this work."

** June 4th suppression of history reversing **

Chen Yonglin, a political consul of the Chinese Consulate General in Sydney, told this station that he witnessed the Democratic Movement in Beijing in 1989; the people who were shot shot by the PLA, including the students of the diplomatic college he knew.

On the evening of June 4 this year, Chen Yonglin came to the Sydney Chinese Consulate to attend the candlelight mourning rally to condemn the CCP's process of blocking China to block China's opening up. He said:

"The Tianmen massacre in 1989 still had bloody, and reversed the history of China to the original state of the wild love."

University of Science and Technology of Sydney(UTS)Associate Professor Feng Chongyi attended a June 4th seminar on June 3; he explained in response to the question of the station that the democratic movement was suppressed in 1989, and then the Communist Party of Eastern Europe fell down. In response, Deng Xiaoping's old veterans supported the second generation of the Red and tried to keep the CCP regime.

On June 5, the Taiwan representative of the United States Xiao Meiqin held a routine tea narrative of Chinese media to explain the views on the strengthening of economic and trade relations in the United States and Taiwan and the avoidance of double taxation. Some scholars have pointed out that Taiwan is expected to get rid of the dependence on the Chinese market through related US agreements.

[** US Taiwan Trade Initiative Preliminary Negotiations Complete Scholars: Copy Chinese Economic Coercion **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/tj-05192023094904.html)*** [Meitai Relations Raising Cai Yingwen: After the trade negotiation is successful, agricultural products are given priority to the United States](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/10-01232023160632.html)**

After nearly a year of negotiations, the US -Taiwan official finally signed the first batch of agreements to the 21st Century Trade Initiative. On the morning of June 1st, under the witness of the US Deputy Trade Representative Sarahbianchi and Deng Zhenzhong, a member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, the executive director of the United States Association in Taiwan and the representative of the Taiwan representative Xiao Meiqin in the United States in the United States In the Taiwan Association (AIT) Washington headquarters officially signed relevant documents.

** Xiao Meiqin: The second stage of negotiations will start as soon as possible **

Xiao Meiqin said on a regular tea narrative in the Chinese media in the Shuang Oak Garden of Washington (5th): "We just signed the first batch of agreements, and both parties also agreed very quickly to start the second stage as soon as possible Negotiations. Both parties also take stocks and preparations on the topic of negotiations in the second stage. We also hope that specific progress can be achieved at the fastest speed. "

The main contents of the first batch of US -Taiwan agreements are aimed at five issues, namely customs management and convenient trade, good legal operations, small and medium -sized enterprises, anti -corruption and domestic rules of the industry. The next second stage of negotiations will involve other more complex trading areas, including seven issues such as agricultural, labor and environmental standards, digital trade, state -owned enterprises, and non -market policies. Essence

The signing of the above agreement will undoubtedly further pull closer to the United States and Taiwan, and at the same time, it will touch some of the current Taiwan exports to dependence on the mainland market. According to Taiwan, the signing of the first batch of the United States and Taiwan was the most large -scale and comprehensive trade negotiations of the two sides since 1979. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that "China has strong dissatisfaction with this and has proposed to the United States solemnly."

Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tomas University in the United States, told this station: "The United States is still the largest market in the world. Taiwan can slowly sign this free trade agreement through the next. It is highly effective to let Taiwan slowly get rid of the Chinese market. "

Ye Yaoyuan pointed out that the first phase of the agreement laid a good foundation for the future of the United States and Taiwan to sign a bilateral free trade agreement, and it can be seen that some market effects can be seen: "Because this infrastructure is available, many manufacturers have begun to prepare how they are going to prepare. Export their products to the US market. This preparation has begun. "

** Xiao Meiqin: Avoiding double taxation is the key point in Taiwan in the next stage **

" Also long for a long time(Taiwan)A problem raised by the US Chamber of Commerce, and we also hope to make progress as soon as possible. "

At the end of March this year, US Finance Minister Yellen(Janet Yelle)When testing by Congress, it was stated that the lack of relevant dual taxation agreement in the United States and Taiwan was a "very major problem" and will "see if it can find a solution" with the US State Department.

In the tea narrative, Xiao Meiqin thanked US Treasury Secretary Yellen to make a positive response. She said: "We also hope to be able to talk about this issue between the administrative departments as soon as possible. In this regard, we also thank the Congress and the cross -committees of Congress and the two houses. They also attach great importance to this issue. "

However, the United States and Taiwan signed a major obstacle to avoiding a double -course tax agreement involving a major obstacle. Because the United States has not recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state, it cannot sign relevant treaties. Bloomberg had previously quoted sources that some US officials expressed hesitation, arguing that this may be regarded by Beijing as provocative.

Xiao Meiqin said that the US Senate Diplomacy and the Finance Commission have proposed relevant legislation proposals; in the House of Representatives in the United States, the fundraising committee in charge of the financial tax also has a positive attitude. State.

"In this issue, we see that whether it is Speaker McCarthy who had met in California before, or the predecessor of Perlis, or the current minority leaders, they also expressed their attention to this issue. In such an atmosphere In this case, we hope to achieve some specific progress as soon as possible. "Xiao Meiqin said.

Xiao Meiqin emphasized that avoiding dual taxation issues will be an important task for the next stage of Taiwan's representative offices in the United States and Taiwan Trade Agreement.

On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the June 4th incident around the world, the legislators of the United States have also publicly expressed their concerns about the Chinese people's fighting for democracy and freedom. On Monday, the Special Committee of the US -China Strategic Competition of the House of Representatives in the United States and the leaders of the Eight -Nine Democratic Games jointly discussed the current situation of Chinese society to fight for democracy.

[** Democratic Virtual Statue of Democratic Statue before Washington held a 64th candlelight mourning event **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/wy-06032023092053.html)*** [The 34th Anniversary of the June Fourth Massacre of the Chinese Embassy "The 34th Anniversary of the June Fourth Massacre" Mainly "young people](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/wy2-06032023190759.html)**

On June 5th, the US -China House of Representatives US -China Strategic Competition Special Committee held a round table with a number of eight -nine civil movement leaders to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and the struggle for freedom and democracy in Chinese society.

"It is important that we can never forget the terrible atrocities that happened at Tiananmen Square that day." American House Speaker Kevinmccarthy opened bluntly: "As a legislator, we may sometimes different, but one of us can support is what we can support is what we can support is what we can support is that we can all support something is what we can support is what we can support is what we can support is what we can support is what we can support is what we can support is that what we can support is what we can support is what we can support is that we can all support. Freedom. When we discuss this day, we tell us in the same voice that we remember countless killed innocent people. Every year, our responsibilities are to remember, remind and repeat their stories. "

"We tell ourselves a fairy tales. If it is economically liberalized, the CCP will be politically liberalized, but the facts are just the opposite." Go to Peng Lifa, the "Sitong Bridge Warrior" in Beijing: "Why is Beijing so obsessed with everything that eliminates the Tiananmen Square Holocaust? Because they are afraid of losing their control over one of their most important areas ... now the lesson in June 1989 is still It's not too late. "

The committee member and Democratic member Raja Krishnamoorthi showed the famous "tank" photo at the meeting. The photo was taken in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. The Chinese who struggled freely used their bodies to block the army to suppress the people's tanks. He said: "Today we must remember that when Xi Jinping said,‘ harsh the infiltration, subversion, destruction, and division of hostile forces' in the hostile forces, he was telling the world that the Chinese Communist Party was going to dispatch those tanks again. "

He said that in 1966, the former leader of the Communist Party of China Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution and ruined the Chinese economy. As a result, since the end of the 1970s, the resistance movement of Chinese society has erupted, including the Beijing Xidan Democratic Wall Movement (also known as "Beijing Spring"). The CCP began the so -called "reform and opening up."

"This idea has been brewing for ten years in Chinese society. Everyone's thoughts throughout the 1980s are becoming more and more open, and Western thoughts have also entered China. At this time, the CCP felt threatened." He said: "Because people demanded The idea of freedom and democracy is too strong, and this democratic movement broke out in 1989. So the Communist Party felt that there was no other way to persuade the people, and only the army could kill the people. "

Wei Jingsheng said that in recent years, China's economy has continued to decline. Xi Jinping, the leader of the Communist Party of China, uses various high -pressure policies to suppress various dissatisfaction at the social level, and has born Peng Lifa, the "Sitong Bridge Warriors", opposed to sealing and opposing Xi Jinping's "white paper sports". "This is amazing from the history of 1989.

"This situation is very similar to that in 1989. The people were very dissatisfied, and the government could not handle it." He said: "And the struggle of the Communist Party's internal group has become very fierce, which is very similar."

Wei Jingsheng believes that Chinese society is about to usher in a huge change, and the international community led by the United States should think about how to cope with this change. He called on the U.S. government to increase pressure on China through the principle of peering, and adopt more substantial actions to support the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and democracy. He said: "If the United States cannot change China, then Xi Jinping may also want to change the United States. Americans may feel that Xi Jinping is arrogant and he can't do it, but Xi Jinping doesn't think so."

Li Hengqing, the student leader of the 1989 period, told the American legislators that Xi Jinping has consolidated his personal rule by sacrificing the economy, which has laid a foreshadowing for social dissatisfaction. He mentioned the "white paper movement" that occurred in China's major cities at the end of last year. The new generation of young people is more brave than students participating in the 1989 Democratic Games, because their demands are not only for democracy and freedom, but also require the Communist Party of China to step down. Xi Jinping stepped down.

He believes that the United States should not convey errors in the formulation of China's policy, that is, the United States does not seek to change the Chinese Communist power. He said that if the CCP regime does not change, then the international community should not expect that China will make any improvements in democracy and human rights, and it is impossible to prevent Xi Jinping's ambitions from expanding.

Li Hengqing warned: "Xi Jinping doesn't just want to destroy China. He is trying to destroy the whole world."

From the past in the factory city, to "changing the world", from the past youth and honor, to the current confusion and open -minded coexistence, Behind it is the epitome and results of economic and social evolution over decades.

This is not just Hua Lin, but to see the whole northeast. This black land has experienced major events such as revolutionary war, industrial aid, oilfield exploration, and food base construction. However, after the reform and opening up, the development of the Northeast has reversed. The economic slowdown, residents' migration, lack of fertility, lagging reforms, and lack of innovation are superimposed. If the perspective is stretched to a century, the Northeast is just like the Yuanchun of the "Breakthrough", the summer of the "eldest son of the Republic", and Xiao Qiu and Xue Dong in the past half a century. Based on the moment, the regional economic slowdown, the lack of emerging industries, the low fertility, and the bottleneck of debt have become the problem of urgent and survival in the Northeast.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-06T01-19-00-08-00/04india-rail-01-pqhg-master1050.jpg)In India, the main industrial and political destiny is often associated with a huge, intertwined railway system. India puts a large number of public resources into a new train. However, for trains that have been running on the track, safety guarantee funds are much more tense. Essence

On Sunday, at least 275 people died in eastern India [heavy train accident](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/03/world/asia/india-train-crash.html)After that, these decisions became prominent issues, which is the most serious railway accident in the country for many years. Investigators said that their focus was on the possibility of signal faults that caused the collision of three trains on Friday.

The authorities said that at the time of the accident, a row drove south to Jinsai City's passenger train at a speed of 128 kilometers per hour [turning the wrong track, hitting a static truck](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/04/world/asia/india-train-crash-cause.html)Essence The accident also injured more than 1,100 people. The first train's derailment compartment then hit the second passenger trains driven to it, [causing a terrible scene](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/world/asia/india-train-crash.html)Essence

In the past few years, India has been unprecedentedly improving infrastructure in a state of riots for a long time, and Indian railways, which occupy the core position in the world's fifth largest economy, have always been the main beneficiary. In the previous fiscal year, the government spent nearly $ 30 billion on the railway system, an increase of 15%over the previous year.

But the costs used for basic track maintenance and other security measures have been declining. The Indian Audit Office (an independent agency) last year [Report](https://cag.gov.in/webroot/uploads/download_audit_report/2022/Report-No.-22-of-2022_Railway_English_DSC-063a2dda55f3ce6.38649271.pdf)It is found that the funds allocated to the maintenance and maintenance of the line have decreased, and officials did not even spend all the funds reserved.

India has more than 20 million passengers on the railway every day, many of them are migrant workers. Politicians will not invest a lot of funds on the railway system. Prime Minister Narendra Modi does this, and he does not hesitate. This year, the Indian railway -one of the largest railway systems in the world -the budget was five times when he took office.

But Modi's most measures are not aimed at the basic steps required from one place to run from one place to another, but to improve the speed and comfort. He often praises new types of VANDEBHARAT electric trains connecting large cities and higher fares, and listed a high -speed railway project built with Japanese Shinkansen technology as priority, although it has no help to improve the lives of ordinary Indian passengers.

The Indian government said the investment was to help improve the experience of taking the Indian railway to the world -class level and attract overseas investment.

However, according to the recently announced budget, the proportion of project expenditures for improving the safety of more than 13,000 old trains in India has been declining in total expenditure, and even the absolute value is declining.

Patti Muhopadier, a senior researcher at the New Delhi Policy Research Center, specifically mentioned a demand. "The signal function may require more attention," he said. "From a strategic point of view, signals are a kind of soft ability supplement. As we turn to a higher speed train, the signal will become more important."

Despite the severe casualties in the collision accident on Friday, India's railway travel is still much safer than ever.

In this country, the derailment accident was quite frequent. From 1980 to Century, an average of 475 occurred each year. According to the [File] submitted by railway officials at the World Disaster Management Conference(https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9Pi0EAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA250&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false)In the ten years before 2021, this number dropped to more than 50.

India's railway safety has also been widely improved, and the number of serious accidents has steadily decreased: from more than 300 starting and landing 20 years ago to 22 fiscal year. By 2020, India has not died in a railway accident for two consecutive years. This is a milestone celebrating the Modi government. Until 2017, more than 100 passengers were killed every year in India.

Under the leadership of Modi, India has been spending a lot. The Ministry of Finance and the World Bank hope that private enterprises can follow the government's approach and inject more funds into the economy. The World Bank pointed out in a report in April that the Indian government's expenditure in achieving long -term goals "increased from the level before the epidemic." The transportation including the railway plays an important role in the surge in the expenditure.

"In the 21st century, for the rapid development of the country, the growth and reform of the railway are crucial," last year, [Modi said at the completion ceremony of a railway line](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/centre-transforming-railway-infra-by-making-record-investment-pm-modi-122123000829_1.html)Essence "A nationwide railway reconstruction movement is in progress."

The World Bank is responsible for India's director of August Tonano Qumei, saying that high public expenditures in power distribution, new highways and railways will "attract" companies that pursue long -term returns to increase expenditure.

During the total mileage of about 64,000 kilometers, it only covered about 1448 kilometers. Trains that had a crash accident on Friday did not use the system. The opposition politicians and former Minister of Railway Marta Marta Banaja caught this.

"If there is this device on the train, this kind of thing will not happen," she told reporters.

Minister of Railway Waish -Some people have asked him to resign -refuted this view.

"This accident has nothing to do with the collision system," he said.

Some scholars have described the cooperation between China and the United States with the term "Chimerica" (China and the United States), which is a state of embracing symbiosis. In the past ten years, relations between the two countries have moved towards unrestrained mutual exclusion. Now, the two parties in Washington have reached a consensus that the long -term strategy of deepening the economic relations with China has failed. The Chinese leadership has increasingly regarded the United States as a threat to survival. In these two countries, if anyone claims to take a more relaxed route, it will be regarded as politically naive or worse.

As the Ukrainian war entered the 16th month, educational projects around Russia were full of courses and extra -curricular activities around military themes and patriotism.

These methods are part of the Kremlin Palace to expand the military social movement of Russia. The purpose is to cultivate offspring to feed the army and further consolidate President Putin -he was in a ritual last month [solemn](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-downbeat-vladimir-putin-slams-at-low-key-victory-day-parade-celebrations-moscow-kremlin-ukraine-war/)Proclaimed that "a real war was launched again in our motherland."

The horn of educational instillation basically began in Russia to annex Crimea in 2014, but the comprehensive invasion of Ukraine accelerated the process. The Ministry of Education and Sciences have continuously released materials, including the step -by -step curriculum plan and real examples -such as a video of a student concert, and use poetry, dance and drama to explain the history of Russia's foreign intelligence work.

"It includes all grades from kindergarten to university," said Daniel Ken, the head of the independent Russian union "Teacher Alliance" in the voluntary exile. "They try to let all these children and all students participate directly in the support of the war."

Over the years, Russian leaders have been trying to allow their citizens to accept Moscow's leadership, which includes prohibiting schools from involving politics. Now, the Kremlin hopes to persuade the public to actively support the efforts of the war, and for young men, they should go to the war.

However, it also hopes to avoid inciting too fierce patriotic flames to avoid promoting the Russians to begin to question the purpose of war. Just as Putin restrained the number of recruits to avoid aroused anti -war mood, the Kremlin also left some room for their parents to make them not need to take publicity classes.

In this regard, they may want to avoid the disconnection of the Soviet era. At that time, the education system described this country as a rich place for communism, but even ordinary Russians could see the air on the shelves.

"They want enthusiasm, but they realize that if they are too hard, they may arouse organizational opposition," said social anthropologists Alexandra Al Shippova, a social anthropologist who responded to the war. "They don't want people to protest."

In the past month, interviews with sociologists, educators, parents and students, and the review of a large amount of materials released by schools and local news media on the Internet, showed that the government has strengthened the military in all 40,000 public schools in Russia in comprehensive efforts. Patriotic content.

The cornerstone of this operation is a plan called "Important Talk" launched in September last year. At 8 am every Monday, the school should hold a rally to raise the Russian flag while playing the national anthem, and then hold an hour of class discussions on topics such as Russian history.

Education Minister Sergei Kravzov did not answer the written question. When the plan was launched last fall, he [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/15595487)Official media Tas Society, "We hope that contemporary students grow up in completely different traditions and are proud of their motherland." Official [Telegram Channel](https://web.telegram.org/a/#-1642068919)[Website](https://razgovor.edsoo.ru/)They are all disseminated materials.

Courses such as "courage education" or "our heroes" are supplemented by "important talks". These courses encourage students to write the record of poetry to praise the motherland and Russian soldiers. Countless videos show elementary school students [recitation](https://t.me/nenorma_project/294)Such as "all scammers escape from Russia; they should live in the West; they are gangsters, chickens."

The course depends on some of the past wars, especially the Soviet Union successfully defeated Nazi Germany. Based on the advice of that era, sometimes it looks very outdated, such as encouraging students to knit socks for troops.

Veterans appeared frequently in class, and they introduced their experiences in detail in class. In late April, in a small city near Moscow, Dmitrov, three [Soldiers](https://vk.com/video/@dmitrovtv?z=video-94883561_456246860%2Fpl_-94883561_-2)Speak to students aged 10 to 15, some of them wielded a small Russian flag. A video of the meeting showed that a soldier talked about the infringement of "fascist dirt" who wanted to protect his motherland.

However, in general, there is no use of a single publicity machine, because the specific operation of the "important conversation" is largely handed over to the local school leaders to decide.And some teachers do not even think of war, especially in places like Moscow, many parents there do not agree with the practice of instilling thoughts for children.

Former student psychologist in Moscow, a former student psychologist in the elite high school, said in an interview that in a study of a paper, he discovered some unique interpretations of the project. For example, a math teacher told students that the most important dialogue in the world is about algebra, so his class specially talks about the number. In a "motherland"(fatherland)On the theme of concept -centered, a biological teacher taught the phenomenon of salmon in the rivers that they hatched.

Even if there is a war class, it is sometimes difficult to start. At a science and engineering college in St. Petersburg, there was a school meeting invited two soldiers, and the students were basically laughed at them. According to the recording of the school meeting, students questioning why fighting in another country means that they are defending Russia and how God will look at others. Local reports said that the school leaders rebuked at least five students due to these problems.

Last fall, the 17 -year -old senior high school student Sasha Boyeqko attended four "important conversations" courses in Vladivostok. Later, she and her family left Russia. She recalled that the boring students laughed at these historical exhibitions. In an interview, she said: "After class, we are all thinking, why do we come?"

Alexander Cantlashev, who has been a 10 -year -old teacher in Russia, said he was waiting for the revised edition of the textbooks this fall. [Mediazona](https://en.zona.media/article/2022/04/23/kyiv_erased)A early copy obtained by the news organization discovered a fundamental change; all the content mentioned that Kiev, the Ukraine capital, was deleted.

"No one thinks the 'important conversation' is something that will come in handy in learning life, just like those physics, mathematics, geography, or historical lessons," Kantlashev said in an interview.

There are many forms that are not obedient. Teachers' alliance suggested that parents can formally choose not to participate in these courses, and some parents let their children be late or ask for sick leave on Monday. Experts say that resistance makes some parents feel nervous, especially considering that school officials have reported a case where dozens of parents or students are not enthusiastic.

47 -year -old Zrema said she was worried about her three sons to school in Dagistan. When she sent the sixth grade son to the "important conversation" course, she told him never to participate in politics. "We are afraid of everything here," she said. Because involving criticism of this war, she asked not to use her full name.

To a large extent, Russia described this war as an economic opportunity in poor areas, while the means in big cities were relatively subtle.

"They tried to target those with less resources," said Russian sociologist Greg Udin, who studied at Princeton University in an interview. "They give you a choice to promise money, status, and benefits. In addition, you will become a hero." He pointed out that even if they only persuaded 20%of young people to participate in the army, it is still a huge army Essence

To this end, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of National Defense announced that tenth -grade students will receive compulsory military training next year. Girls will learn the battlefield first aid, and boys will learn to practice formation and use the skills of using Karashnikov.

In college, the autumn course will include a compulsory course called "Russian National Basic".

Yuding pointed out that the course is still being formulated, but he said that the details that have appeared often echoed Putin's Russian exceptional world view, and said that the battle against Western rule in the past millennium will last thousands of years.

Recently, media reports have been bad for employment. We have gone through the trend of "resignation", the "anti -work" movement, "spiritual resignation" and a wave of strikes. All this seems to make people feel that the work is getting worse, and people are tired of it. Last year, I was even invited to participate in a podcast discussion entitled "Is this the end of the job we know?"

But the data is not necessarily the case, at least in the UK. Cardiff University(Cardiff University)Allen Felstand(AlanFelstead)和里斯•戴维斯(Rhysdaves)A online survey was conducted in 2018/19 and 2022. They collected about 100,000 people from all over the country about the detailed questions about their work. Scholars found that in 2022, people claimed that they had greater ability to decide when and stopped working. In emergency situations, there was greater vacation space. Managers supported them more. There are more rights to speak in related decisions, with better promotion prospects and higher work guarantee. The disadvantage is that their free discretion in work tasks has decreased.

Hansen had intermittently served as a spy for Moscow during the Cold War and the Cold War for more than 20 years. This is one of the worst spy cases in American history.

In a statement, the Federal Prison Administration stated that in the Florens federal felony prison in Hansen's life imprisonment, the staff found that he lost consciousness at 7 am. Hanson died invalid. The statement did not give the cause of death.

The Hanson case is considered one of his most infamous spy scandals. When he learned that he had provided intelligence to the enemy for many years, he was shocked by the heads of the federal investigation bureau and other government officials. To this day, the Federal Investigation Bureau still calls him "[the most destructive spy in the history of the Investigation Bureau"]](https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/robert-hanssen)Essence

In order to exchange for a total of 1.4 million US dollars in cash, banking funds and diamonds, Hanson passed a large number of confidential information to Moscow, including the U.S. government dug a tunnel underground in the Soviet Embassy in Washington to eavesdo the diplomacy and other communications. He also informed Moscow the three KGB agents secretly engaged in spy activities for the United States, causing two of them to be executed later.

"The severity of the Hansen crime is not an exaggeration," said the federal prosecutor Paul McNernalti who sued him that year in response to the death report on Monday. "People will not forget that what he does is one of the most shocking beliefs in American history. For the Federal Investigation Bureau, this case is a trough of it and a successful investigation."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-06T05-24-00-08-00/05Hanssen2-fjmq-master1050.jpg)In 2009, Hansen's documents and business cards were exhibited at the Federal Investigation Bureau of Kukiko, Virginia. Paul j. Richards/Agency France-Presse-Getty Images

But both sides are determined to stop here, so as not to cause it to cause more lasting damage.

The exposure of the Hansen spy activity embarrassed the Federal Investigation Bureau and caused the change of security procedures. After his arrest, he told the investigators that the relaxation of the security work of the Investigation Bureau could be said to be "negligent." He said that as long as it has been routinely examined, he can access confidential materials on the official computer. This is a very simple thing.

"As long as the people in the bureau can find something in the system," the report of the case in 2002 about the case quoted Hanson's words, "This is a crime."

In order to avoid being sentenced to death, Hansen acknowledged 15 spy and conspiracy and regretted his rebellion. "I am ashamed of this," he said at the 2002 hearing.

In 1985, he began to engage in espionage and provides information to KGB. This time, he used encrypted communication and other secret methods to better cover up his trace; even the Russians did not know who he was. Hansen only uses codes such as "B" and "Ramon Garcia" to show his identity. His sensitive information is said to include detailed satellite intelligence collection capabilities.

After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, he stopped the espionage again, until 1999 to re -operate the old industry. Prosecutors said his betrayal has not been discovered for many years. He has received at least $ 600,000 in cash and diamonds from the KGB and the heirs of the Soviet era. He, a bank in Moscow also reserved $ 800,000 for him.

这种名为「长鬃矛神龙」(Ubirajarajubatus)的小型恐龙长有原始羽毛，以及从肩部长出宛如长矛的杆状物。科学家对这种恐龙感到惊艳，并在2020年发表研究确认它是未知物种。

但这块化石很快引起科学和伦理上的丑闻，当时巴西研究人员指控这份研究报告背后的德国团队，非法将化石带离巴西。

官员表示，在僵持不下近3年后，德国外交部长贝尔伯克(Annalena Baerbock)率领的代表团，4日在访问巴西利亚时，将化石归还给巴西。

巴西科学与科技部今天在声明中说：「长鬃矛神龙是在南美洲发现第一种具羽毛状结构的非鸟类恐龙，这块化石已被送回巴西。」

由考古学家组成的一支团队，于1990年在巴西东北部的塞阿拉州(Ceara)发现这块化石。他们将化石带回德国研究，并将它搜藏在位于卡斯陆(Karlsruhe)的国立自然历史博物馆(StateMuseum of Natural History)中。

但巴西科学家在2020年12月将长鬃矛神龙订为新物种的论文发表后发声，称化石从巴西被非法带走。

巴西法律规定，在巴西发现的化石都归该国所有，外国研究人员若想将化石带出巴西，就必须与巴西机构合作研究。

科学家发起线上活动，呼吁将化石归还给巴西，并用「长鬃矛神龙属于巴西」(#UbirajarabelongstoBR)当主题标签发文。

巴西科学与科技部部长阿鲁达(Inacio Arruda)说：「如果没有巴西科学界的动员，我们不会成功。」

这块重11.5公斤的化石，现将存放在塞阿拉一间大学的古生物博物馆。

### AI fraud, fake information rise

AI has developed rapidly in China, and the country's AI -related fraud cases have recently surged. The Wall Street Journal reported on the 5th that police from all over China have recently warned the public to be careful to be careful of criminals to fake friends with AI for fraud.

The report stated that a Chinese man named Guo received a scam video on WeChat in April. $ 600,000 to a bank account in Inner Mongolia. It wasn't until the man named Guo contacted his friends to confirm the money that he learned that he was deceived. According to the WeChat post from the Inner Mongolia police, the Chinese authorities have terminated the transaction and tried to recover the deception.

This incident caused heated discussions on the Chinese Internet people. Once, it was widely circulated on Weibo with the label of "#AI fraud in the country". The topic was subsequently restricted by review and could no longer display the search results. In the same month, the Anhui police arrested a scammer for similar cases.

###  False news? Intersection AI!

In addition to fraud, AI also caused multiple fake messages in China. In May, a news film collected by men in May in Gansu used ChatGPT to fabricate a fake post of train accidents, which was published on a blog platform that allows users to divide to make it profitable. Police arrested it and said the article was viewed 15,000 times. In the same month, Henan authorities also said that a fake message that a famous man generated "violently beating a restaurant in a restaurant, a woman was hit by a brick after being died", so as to obtain traffic.

OpenAI has not provided ChatGPT services in China, but there are still many Chinese people who use it to use the wall.

### government supervision

To cope with [endless AI case](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/ai威脅堪比核戰東西方態度不同/a-65776612)The Chinese government has issued relevant regulations.

In response to cases such as fake news and fraud, the China Internet Information Office announced in January that it is prohibited to disseminate errors, illegal or "destroying economic or national security" information generated by images, audio and texts generated by AI. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that these generally and widespread definitions have given the Chinese authorities a considerable freedom of law enforcement.

** "Don't just forget it, okay? Many things can't be counted like this. If this is the case, people will slowly die and die!" This is a TV that became popular in Taiwan last month. The classic lines in the album "Candidates: Creator" came from an opposition female leader that the party workers of the opposition party told the grassroots party workers that they were willing to appeal with the latter in an interior party to encounter sexual harassment. **

After the film was broadcast on the international streaming platform, it became popular in Taiwan. At that time, the major political party staff members, including Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen and the DPP presidential candidate Lai Qingde, all mentioned the success of the film production.

However, no one thought at the time that this set of popular albums of the DPP's political aids as screenwriters predicted the "sexual harassment" of Taiwan's political (including parties) to accuse the tsunami strike.

Related real -name accusations began to appear within the DPP. After that, senior media people accused the Kuomintang's Democratic harassment. The issue of sexual harassment became an unexpected storm shortly after the presidential election of Taiwan's presidential election.

However, the dispute has also been extended to the academic and literary circles. In the past few days, the accused, including the "June 4th" democratic movement Wang Dan, who is a guest assistant professor at Tsinghua University, Taiwan, and Beiling, an exile writer who visited Taiwan in Taiwan. But both have denied the relevant allegations.

Other cases include associate professors of Taiwan Chung Kyoga University, professor at the National Taiwan University Hospital, President of the People's Party, Ke Wenzhe, a former courage, Kuomintang think tank scholar, documentary director and senior local newspaper senior management.

Most of these charges have denied relevant allegations and claimed to be willing to clarify judicial channels. BBC Chinese cannot independently verify related allegations.

Taipei MRT.

Last week, Chen Yan, a grass -roots party worker who worked as a DPP of the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party, accused the real -name "Facebook". When he worked in a election campaign last year, he encountered sexual harassment in the workplace. She said that although the Women's Ministry in the party was immediately notified (now the Ministry of Gender Equality), she claimed that the senior female supervisor of women's movement was improperly treated and secondary injuries. She said that after watching the TV series, her mood collapsed again, but she was publicly public, hoping that the party would still reform.

The woman surnamed Chen quickly discussed in Taiwan's politics. The next day, another former party worker named by the Democratic Progressive Party pointed out that he had encountered sexual harassment in the workplace of colleagues in the party. The woman posted a post, but after the report was reported to the supervisor, they encountered the latter despise, and after joining the harm to the harm, they had a problem with the mental health and then left. The woman named Chen also complained that at the time, the witnesses at the scene were rarely reached out.

After the two articles were issued, the public opinion of Taiwan ’s public opinion was uproar. The DPP faced the storm in the party. Taiwan’ s President Tsai Ing -wen issued an apology. In addition to the apology, the DPP, also known as the DPP will completely reform.

Lai Qingde proposed a three -point innovation plan on Monday (June 5), including the establishment of a direct appeal window, the principles of zero tolerance, and immediately revising the party's rules. Li Yanrong, director of the Democratic Progressive Party, set up an appeal mailbox saying that only she could read the mailbox and encouraged the victims to file a appeal.

The issue of sexual harassment became an unexpected political storm when the Taiwan presidential election officially started in 2024. The focus of public opinion in Taiwan is the first to the DPP -the party has promoted many women's participation in politics and marriage equality. Now how will it completely reform and respond to the outside world, especially the young generation.

Observing the crisis of sexual harassment allegations involved in the Democratic Progressive Party, Li Dingzan, a retired professor of the Sociology Institute of Tsinghua University in Taiwan, posted on Facebook that "the DPP has attaches importance to disadvantaged and a few, which is an important core value of the party." However, in recent years, President Tsai Ing -wen has particularly focused on Guoan and the economy, and the marginalization of core values. Many social, cultural and educational issues, "almost not in the minds of the governors. . The appearance in the Women's Department and the Youth Ministry is even more ironic, which also highlights the changes in the ruling party in recent years. "

Li Dingzan believes that the DPP will return to the original intention of the founding party. "And set off from here, use this incident to make a comprehensive reflection, actively take care of the disadvantaged and a few, and propose a specific policy plan in order to slowly find the lost person's heart. Come."

### Frequent transmission of sexual harassment cases in Taiwan

In fact, in Taiwan's political circle, regardless of the position, frequent cases about sexual harassment or even sexual assault have been criticized, it has always been criticized.

On Tuesday (June 6), the Taipei Court judged that the KMT legislator Chen Xuesheng had a sexual harassment of the DPP legislators Fan Yun, and sentenced to a total of NT $ 80,000 of Fan Nan. The Kuomintang responded that it respects the judicial judgment but will not revoke Chen Xuesheng's qualifications to nominate the next legislature.

According to [Taiwan Media](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/202111120319.aspx)At the end of 2021, the current deputy mayor of Taipei City Lin Yihua used to be the legislator in the past. Lin Nan, director of the office, was also suspected of sexual assaulting a woman. Lin Yihua and Lin Nan brought civil compensation for more than 2 million yuan.

The woman named Zhong named Zhong who had accused the sexual harassment in the workplace in the people's party [then posted on Facebook](https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?Type=24&SerialNo=139889)When questioning the controversy of the People's Party criticized the DPP's sexual show, the attitude of allegations of allegations of her allegations, Zhong Nu said, "Have you ever thought about my feelings? Why did his party incident coming out the next day?"He said that the Kuomintang may also be reluctant to attack the DPP on this issue, because there were similar cases in the party in the past, and cases that were unwilling to be disclosed may also be. Qiu Qixin said: "Similarly, Ke Wenzhe, chairman of the people and presidential candidates, has been criticized for a long time. This has been criticized for a long time. This may also be captured by the pan -green camp."

### sexual harassment incident is difficult to cause?

Taiwan streets.

Based on Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare last year [Statistics](https://www.mohw.gov.tw/cp-5271-70900-1.html)It shows that in the past 5 years, the number of sexual harassment appeals in Taiwan has increased year by year. 96%of the victims of sexual harassment are women, and more than 60%of those under 30.

The Taiwan Women's Rights Group also held a press conference on "Make the victims for sexual harassment" on Monday (June 5). They quoted the "Equal Employment Survey of Working Places Employment Employment" from 2017 to 2021 that they quoted data from the "Employment Employment Employment Employment Survey" of the workplace that 70-80 % of the parties who encountered sexual harassment on the workplace chose not to appeal, which became a "silent black number" (refers to The underestimated number).

These groups stated that according to the current relevant regulations of Taiwan, they only mentioned that the employer's "obtaining" was introduced and counsel or medical resources to the victims, but the law did not force the employer to provide substantial assistance or services. Therefore, sexual harassment victims usually can only explore solutions alone, and most people choose to give up appeal or private.

Dai Jingyun, director of the Law Department of the New Knowledge Foundation of Taiwan Women's New Foundation, emphasized at a press conference that the current Taiwan's "Equality Law of Gender Work" will attribute the investigation responsibility for investigation, but if sexual harassment is an employer, it will become players and referees. A large loophole.

In addition, in case of the female party worker named by the Democratic Progressive Party, when the victim is a customer or partner of the employee, such as outsourcing manufacturers, it is difficult for employers to investigate or punish employers in accordance with the law. Dai Jingyun said that the current sexual harassment prevention regulations are complicated, and the public is not only difficult to understand the law, but there are often controversy in legal practice.

Wang Yanhao, CEO of the Taiwan Lixin Foundation, said at the press conference that according to the "Gender Violence Question A questionnaire survey" completed in 2021, 25 % of Taiwanese people will appeal to the work unit when they encounter sexual harassment in the workplace. However, 50 % of them cannot be crossed because of lack of evidence.

The feminist group calls on the Taiwan government to incorporate the care service mechanism of sexual harassment in the workplace as soon as possible into the "Equality Law of Gender Work", so that people who have been sexually harassed in the workplace can receive the assistance of legal consultation, psychological business, and social workers in accordance with the law.

### Russia and Ukraine War: Two ins and outs of the armed forces from Ukraine into Russia

Russia claims that the troops of the Russian Free Legion (personnel in the picture) and the Russian Volunteer Corps were repelled and left the Russian territory.

** Russia claims to repel a warrior from the Belgorod region from Ukraine to the Belgorod in a "anti -terrorist operation". **

Russia said that the rebels involved were Ukraine's "destructives", but Ukrainian officials said they were Russian citizens and from the Russian Volunteercorps of two quasi -military organizations and Freedom of Russian Legy. Essence

Military analysts pointed out that the actions of the two groups may be strongly assisted by the Ukrainian armed forces and intelligence departments.

###  What is the Russian Volunteer Corps?

The Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) first appeared in March this year and participated in cross -border attacks on Bryansk, central Russia near the Ukraine border. The legion said 45 people participated.

The organization said that the implementation attack was to encourage the Russians to resist their government.

Unthically reported that the incident involved shootings, casualties, and hostage abductions. RDK said that it has not captured any hostages and has been safely withdrawn to Ukraine.

Members of the Russian Volunteer Corps in the border town Kojin Carlish Shadow.

RDK's leader claims to be Denis Kapustin, or Denis Nikitin.

He is a Russian nationalist, and the organization also publicly supports the Russian regime of only the Russian nation.

In 2020, an Ukraine investigation website accused him of being associated with the new Nazi organization. Capstine has said in the past that he is a member of the Football Rogue Sports Organization.

RDK accused Putin accused Putin "Bolshevik" (that is, communism), and said that Russia's mainstream opposition forces acted as ride in the Ukrainian war.

However, Dr Marina Miron, a defense researcher at King College of London, said why Russia's extremist nationalist organizations started war to Russia, which is puzzling.

"RDK should be established by Ukraine," she said. "It was a small loose organization in Russia before the war, and there was no armed branch at that time."

A RDK member code -named "Fortuna" told the Ukrainian media last November that the number of people in the organization was 120.

"We are a volunteer organization, not like the Ukrainian national service personnel who are convened through recruitment or contracts," he said.

### What is the Russian Free Legion?

The Russian Liberal Legion (FRL) is also known as the Liberty of RussioGion. It is a very different organization to fight the Russian forces with the Ukrainian army.

It uses the banner of "white-blue-white" and is considered by some people within Russia's opposition to be "Liberty Russia".

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-06T08-51-26.000Z/_129839802_image.jpg)Image source, leggliberty.army

It is politically considered to be as extreme as RDK.

On May 22, the legion announced that it had "liberated" the Russian village Keto Card, which was located next to the Ukraine border and located in the southwest of Buerg Rhoder.

"Legion and RDK continue to liberate the Belgore," the legion said.

The organization also stated: "The Russian citizens are safe and the Russian Federation's strong myths have been crushed again."

After that, it posted a video, showing that the balloon with the flag of the organization drifted over Moscow.

Former Russian member Ilyaponamarev is now a Ukrainian citizen. In August 2022, he said on Facebook that they and another organization called the National Republicanarmy ( Signed a declaration together, unanimously agreed to liberate Russia from Putin's rule as a common goal.

A soldier called Caesar and the most famous in the organization said: "No one in the legion was forced to join."

He said that a few members were Russian soldiers who surrendered to join the Ukrainian forces and they chose to go back.

### Do these Russian armed men get Ukraine support?

Andriy Yusov's State Administration of Intelligence said that both organizations were "independently operated in Russia's territory" and Ukraine did not intervene.

Ukraine TV said they were militia and were "Russian volunteers."

However, Dr. Marina Mirang of the King's College of London questioned whether there was no support from the Ukrainian forces, and whether these organizations had the ability to cross the Russian border to launch an attack.

She also questioned why these organizations use Western equipment in the photos, such as Hummer military cars.

"They must rely on external support and information from the Ukrainian intelligence department," Dr. Mirang said.

"However, attacking through the Russian border is in line with the needs of Ukraine and can disperse the attention of the opponent's war in Ukraine, and say that these organizations are responsible for the attack, making it a reason for the past."

Ukrainian political analyst VolodymyRFESENKO said several different quasi -military organizations are working with Ukraine, but they seem to be more public relations and are not practical.

Pence submitted the necessary documents for the Federal Election Commission, but in various public investigations that have been launched so far, his polls support rates are all single, far behind Trump.

Pence plans to carry out a wide range of campaign in Aiwa. The state is the earliest state in the United States to nominate primary votes in the United States. His strong conservative position on abortion and other issues may be attractive to some local voters.

It is expected that Pence will officially announce the campaign on Wednesday. Former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, and Governor of North Dakota, Douge Berms, it is expected to announce his election this week.

In the second half of the presidential election in 2016, as Trump's campaign partner, Pence is his firm supporter and defender. During his co -workers, he was also Trump's most loyal supporter.

But when he lost the 2020 election, Trump began to pressure Burns, asking him to obstruct Congress's certification of the voting results of the Bayeon Election League. Pence rejected Trump's request.

On January 6, 2021, a group of pro -Trump thugs attacked the parliament building. Some of Trump's supporters shouted: "Turning Mike Pence!" Since then, the relationship between the two is broken and it is difficult to reverse.

In September last year, Dissent arranged and paid for nearly 50 immigrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard from Texas to Massachusetts.

Florida officials have not yet expressed their opinions on the long -term flights to Sarami, but California officials said that these immigrants carried documents that are said to be from the Florida Government.

New Song said today, "Di Disante, you are a careful and sad person."

He said, "Isn't this the island of Martha. Abduction allegations?" And attached a screenshot of the California kidnapping.

In the first batch of more than 12 immigrants from Colombia and Venezuela, they arrived in Sarahimore on the 2nd.

They crossed the US border and entered Texas, and were then sent to New Mexico to take a plane.

Rob Bonta, Chief Prosecutor of California, said his office is evaluating whether to file a criminal or civil lawsuit for carriers to transport these vulnerable immigrants.

"State approved abduction is not a choice of public policy. This is immoral and disgusting."

The New York Times reported that it mainly came from about 20 immigrants from Venezuela, and today flew to Sakagram.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) On June 1, a video of "Suspected Mouse Heads in Jiangxi University of Universities" was spread on the Internet. A piece of black foreign body in the meal in the video looks attached with hair, and it is similar to a tooth -like material. Two days later, the Jiangxi Vocational and Technical College, which was involved in the video, issued a notice on its official Weibo that the "foreign body" in the meal was recognized as a duck neck by the parties, which was a normal food.

On June 4, the staff of the Nanchang Market Supervision and Administration Bureau stated that on the day of June 1st, the High -tech Zone Market Supervision and Administration Bureau had sent people to verify and took a special inspection agency for inspection. Sometimes it was very similar to the shape of things. But after the staff verified, it was indeed a duck neck.

The students who filmed the video changed to say that the "foreign body" was not a "mouse head". The results of the "duck neck" of the comparison authentication of the Market Supervision Bureau did not be recognized by online public opinion. A large number of netizens asked, why is there something similar to mice and teeth if the duck neck is on it?

Some netizens suggested that the foreign body that looks like a mouse head for genetic testing, and they can get the test results that everyone takes orally.

In response to Luo Shengmen, who is a "rat head" or "duck neck", Hu Xijin, the former editor -in -chief of the Global Times, wrote: "I think that if the identification of the Nanchang Municipal Supervision Bureau is accurate, they are confident that they are confident. It is necessary to take a clearer shooting of the foreign body and put the video on the Internet. Because the original video is indeed too much like a mouse head, it is difficult to eliminate the strong impression of the text and verbal statement provided by the Municipal Supervision Bureau. Image evidence is necessary, and it can generate key persuasiveness. Otherwise, the doubts on the Internet have its continuing public opinion logic. "

The comments published "" Mouse Head "or" Duck Neck "published by the surging news" Has become Luo Shengmen "also raised the question," Why don't netizens believe 'is duck neck'? "The article replied:" In the state of absent information, netizens judge the same thing based on their "seeing" and life experience, and then express their personal views, which is also natural. "

After the incident was fermented, there were even sources that the owner of the media center of Jiangxi, the owner of the media center of Jiangxi, taught students to control the students in the student group, so that students "actively praise the school's good comments on the school."

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-06T10-40-00Z/64828438_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65837480/64828438)(Voice of Germany)) The National Bureau of Statistics of China recently announced that the national urban survey rate of urban survey in April this year was 5.1%, and the unemployment rate of [16-24-year-old youth survey was 20.4%. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338)The WeChat "Eleven Finance Eleven" published an article by Wang Mingyuan, a researcher at the Beijing Reform and Development Research Association, which believes that the overall unemployment rate of 5.1%is obviously different from everyone's actual feelings. He analyzed several causes of unemployment statistics.

First of all, China set the standard of "employment" too low. According to the official webpage of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, it is considered an employment every week. Wang Mingyuan's article pointed out that in the same way, the United States is 15 hours and France is 20 hours.

Secondly, the urban unemployment survey cannot count the statistics of migrant workers returning to the countryside due to unemployment.

Third, the social security participation rate of China's flexible employment population is very low, so it is difficult to understand its employment situation through indicators such as unemployment insurance and unemployment registration.

### 20.4%is also difficult to be representative

However, Wang Mingyuan's article believes that the unemployment rate at the age of 16-24 is 20.4%. For the entire youth group, this result is not representative. Because at this age, especially 16-20 years old, even if they are not promoted, the labor participation rate is not high, and it is maintained at more than 18%for a long time. Therefore, he selected the age group of 16-40 to define the unemployment rate.

According to his calculation, the Chinese epidemic has three years, and about 15 million graduates have not found a job. At the same time, about 10%of companies have unemployment in employees, of which 16-40 years old are about 25 million. In addition, he quoted Professor Lu Feng of Peking University, at least 23 million agricultural workers returned to his hometown at least 23 million in the past three years, of which about 14 million youths were estimated. In other words, the newly unemployed population has been added about 54 million since the epidemic.

At the same time, some of these unemployed people do not rule out some flexible employment. For example, the number of Didi active drivers in the past three years has increased by more than 1,200 million, and takeaway riders, courier, and distributors have increased by about 8 million. However, it is estimated that half, that is, 25 million-30 million is still unemployed. Therefore, conservatively estimated that the absolutely unemployed population increased by 25 million to 30 million before the epidemic, accounting for about 6.2-7.5%of the total number of labor market labor (402 million) in the age group.

### Under the epidemic, Chinese economy is asthmatic

### Rural are not a way of solution

Wang Mingyuan pointed out that expansion and slowing economic growth will lead to more severe employment problems in the next few years. The solution, he believes that it is not state -owned enterprise or [diverted to the countryside](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体新时代的上山下乡运动/a-65661636)-Because [the scale of the rural economy is very limited, he is calculated equivalent to 10 Huawei, or 3 PetroChina, 7 semi-semi-Jingdong, so at most can only be placed in one or two million highly educated young people employment](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率居高不下-靠孔乙己脱长衫解决/a-65732307)Essence

He believes that from the past 10 years, China's employment increment is basically created by the development of the private economy. Therefore, the private economy, especially the digital economy and service industry need to be supported, and youth entrepreneurship should be encouraged.

The most frequent year of Kim Jong -un's public activities was 2014. In 2018, the dialogue atmosphere formed in South Korea and North Korea was decreased to three times, but in 2019, which was negotiated in the Chaomeimei Hanoi, it increased to 23 times in 2019.

In addition, as of the end of April, Kim Jong -un's public activities were 27 times. Except for military -related activities, other activities were in turn. They attended the ceremony five times, four group photos, three visits, two political conferences, and participated once.

Zhu Chengzhi, an influential disagreement in Hunan, avoided the day of Li Wangyang and personally went to the Dashanling Cemetery in Shaoyang City to worship his friends. He described the on -site alertness, such as the enemy.

Zhu Chengzhi: "When I was about to go there, many people came out of the duty room and the gatekeeper. When I walked to Wangyang Tomb, I was about five meters from me. There are more than a dozen people. I left from the grave sweeping to me, and I didn't say a word. When I arrived at the destination, I mourned for three minutes, and then to the front of Wangyang's tombstone. , Bow deep again. "

Zhu Chengzhi has met Li Wangyang's sister Li Wangling in Shenzhen to worship on the cemetery on June 6, but it is contrary to his wish.

Zhu Chengzhi: "Today (June 6), I came back from Wangyang's tomb and called her (Li Wangling) and told her that I arrived at Wangyang Tomb. After hearing this news, she felt very sad.

[ ![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-06T11-12-00Z/65815453_303.jpg)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65837445/65815453)Defense Director of Defense in Singapore's Shangri -La dialogue meeting

(Voice of Germany in Chinese) European senior national defense officials used the Asian top security forums held in Singapore last weekend to explain their vision of participating in the security of the Indo -Pacific region. Josepborne, the head of the European Union Foreign Policy, said in Shangri -La dialogue that Europe and Asia have a "direct interest relationship" in each other's security.

"We must work together to avoid the confrontation of the region," Brell said on the forum. "In a global world, there is no so -called thing."

At present, the region is intensified. One of the potential conflict explosions is Taiwan, and Taiwan's issue is also a major source of tension between China and the United States. In addition, the sovereign ownership of the South China Sea and the strategic ambitions of Beijing have also led to regional tension. In this context, Europe is seeking a cohesive response.

On Saturday (June 3), on the occasion of the Shangri-La dialogue, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command announced that the US Navy destroyer "USS Chung-Hoon" almost almost occurred with a Chinese naval ship through the Taiwan Strait Crash, "Zhong Yun" had to change the line to avoid collision.

![](Images/dwzh/2023-06-06T11-12-00Z/65818407_401.jpg)China Defense Director Li Shangfu said that in recent years, Sino -US relations have hovered in the trough after establishing diplomatic relations in recent years. "The reason for this difficult situation is clear."

### ** China refused to meet with the United States alone, but chose to talk to Europe **

[Chinese Defense Director Li Shangfu warned at the Shangri -La dialogue that any approach trying to split Taiwan from China will get military responses. China "is not afraid of any opponent, no matter how much the price is paid"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国中美激烈冲突对抗是世界不可承受之痛/a-65819515)Essence

Li Shangfu also criticized that some national warships outside the region sent warships in the South China Sea "to navigate the name of freedom of freedom, and travel the hegemony, and want to confuse the South China Sea."

China has sovereign disputes with multiple Southeast Asian countries in the South China Sea.

According to US media reports, the United States originally hoped that the US -China Defense Ministers met during the forum, but China rejected the US meeting request. Li Shangfu did not meet with the US defense director Austin in Singapore. However, the Chinese Defense Minister did talk to European officials such as Boriel, the head of the European Union's foreign policy Boriel, German Defense Minister Pestorius.

Borel said that the meeting was "constructive" and said on Twitter that Brussels hoped that "continuing to develop the relationship between the European Union and China on the basis of trust and respect for international law."

At the Shangri -La dialogue, Borel also said that the European Union will take more measures to contact the country in the region to help maintain stability. In his speech, he emphasized that Brussels plans to make more efforts to maintain peace in the region, "you can trust us."

### ** Security cooperation is the key to regional partnership **

Felix Heiduk, a senior researcher at the Institute of International and Security, said that the EU's participation in India "has a low starting point, it is slowly and firmly increased."

The Iseas-Yusof Ishakinstitute of Singapore think tanks (Iseas-Yusof Ishakinstitute) said in Southeast Asia, a survey on the "elite class" on the region show that people trust the EU to maintain international law and think of the EU as security partners.

Security cooperation is one of the pillars of the strategic partnership approved by the European Union and ASEAN in 2020. The European Union has signed a defense agreement with Vietnam, and is currently negotiating with other countries in the region on partnership and free trade agreement.

Several European countries, including Germany and France, conducted free exercises in the South China Sea, which is considered a response to the claim of China's territorial sea.

German Defense Prosecutor Pestorius announced at the Shangri -La dialogue that after the deployment in 2021, Germany will send a frigates and a supply ship to the South China Sea in 2024 as part of the freedom of voyage. He emphasized that these exercises are not to deter China, but "committed to protecting rules-based international order. We all recognize these order and will benefit from it-whether in the Mediterranean, Bay of Bay of Bangladesh or in the South China Sea".

### ** EU's security influence in India is still "limited" **

EU foreign policy leader Borrell's speech at the Shangri -La dialogue acknowledged that "Europe is still largely regarded as an acting body outside the region and has limited impact on regional security dynamics in India and Asia."

He said: "My core information is that the alliance is a reliable security partner. We are not a typical military alliance; we are not a traditional country with a magnificent and prestige; we do not have the sixth and seventh fleets to be deployed in the Indo -Pacific region. "

At the same time, Berrell said that some European countries have certain technical capabilities. We hope to develop this ability and become a 'intelligent promoter', dedicated to common security. "

Shadaislam, a European affairs commentator of Brussels, told DW that most Asian countries know that the European Union will not become a real security act like the United States and China, "and they don't want this situation to happen soon."

Sada added that the value of the European Union in the region lies in its soft and safe strength or non -traditional safety strength, such as on issues such as cracking down on pirates, cracking down on illegal fishing, and response to climate change and poverty. Analysts believe that European participation can benefit from low -key and low controversial cooperation forms.

However, this low -key restrictions on the participation of Europe's official security platform in Asia. The EU has recently been allowed to participate in the annual East Asian Summit, which is the most important strategic dialogue forum in the Indo -Pacific region. European officials are also excluded from the ADMM-Plus of the Regional Leading Forum. At present, the application for joining the European Union, France, Germany, and Britain is still unsatisfactory. However, France and the United Kingdom will participate in several expert working groups of the ASEAN Defense Mission Expansion this year. These working groups are lower -level discussion platforms.

Chen Xuechen, assistant professor at the political and international relations of Northeast University in London, told DW that the EU was unlikely to join the ASEAN Defense Ministers Expansion Meeting in the short term. She said that the European Union believes that she is an important security actor, especially in the field of non -traditional security. "However, ASEAN and its member states still believe that the EU is mainly a market forces and important economic behaviors, not the region in the region in the region. Safety Behavior ".

There is also a practical problem that makes the EU's intervention more difficult. China and Russia, which have been members of the ASEAN Defense Ministers for many years, have opposed more Western democratic countries to join the regional framework, and India may also have such an attitude.

In addition, France and Germany often want to participate alone, but some Asian governments hope to have a unified European team. EU affairs commentator Sada said: "Asia does not want dozens of European ministers to join these meetings to make the discussion more complicated."

When the news media in Hong Kong suffered, this was a rare victory in the journalism.

Cai Yuling (also known as A Bao) was famous for investigation documentary for the production of police behavior in 2019. At that time, the city's anti -government protests were in a turbulent for the past few months.

In the documentary she made, there is an episode [awarded program](https://tvfilm.newyorkfestivals.com/Winners/WinnerDetailsNew/ae1a0cfa-80bf-4449-bddf-47ddee103758)The news program "Ji Ji" from the Hong Kong Public Broadcasting Corporation -Hong Kong Radio.

The law stipulates that inciting hate to the government is illegal. This is a crime defined. If a reporter criticizes the authorities in the report, it may violate this crime.

** Social Minnan: Cancel the decision of the non -pure business decision **

Zhou Jiafa believes that HSBC's cancellation of social people's even related accounts is not simply a business decision.

Zhou Jiafa: "If the bank has doubts about your transactions, you will ask you a lot of questions and ask us to fill in a lot of forms to explain, but in this incident, HSBC has not provided any reasons for the group or individual (account). This is political persecution. "

HSBC responded to the community and people's inquiry that all banks would regularly review the status and activities of customer accounts and perform their due diligence responsibilities. According to the results, HSBC may not be able to continue to provide services to individual customers.

Zhou Jiafa: "In the past six months, it is not only a socialist company. Many individuals or unions and other groups have also been canceled using banking services.

Chen Baoying, the chairman of the Social People's Corporation, was worried that the "social credit score" mechanism in mainland China is gradually being introduced to Hong Kong.

Chen Baoying: "This system implemented in China will be scored with the so -called integrity of individuals and enterprises. Implement quietly in Hong Kong? "

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-06T11-32-07-00-00/000000.png)Kherson's military authorities head, OleksandrProkudin, said in the community media that "there are about 16,000 people in the crisis of the right bank of the Hermus area", and there are 8 coasts along the DNIPRO River. The regional flood is a disaster.

As the necks of all walks of life are looking forward to the long -awaited counterattack of Ukraine, the local authorities supported by Moscow pointed out that the dam was "multiple attacks" and was partially damaged.

Ukraine anti -Russian army bombed the hydropower station in Noveya Kakhovka.

The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said: "The goal of terrorists is obvious -to create obstacles for the offensive operation of the armed forces."

Andriyyermak, a staff member of the Ukrainian President Volodymyr ZELENSkyYy, said Zenoski held a national security conference to discuss the "war crime" committed by Russia.

The Crimeanpeninsula water source was supplied to the Crimeanpeninsula. It was occupied by the Russian army at the beginning of Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, and the Crimean Peninsula was annexed by the Moscow authorities as early as 2014.

Zeroski praised the U -so -wiping city near Bakhmut, the Undasus, which was damaged, and then reported that the damage to the dam was revealed, and Russia said that it had repelled the large -scale attack of the Ukraine.

In the film released by the community media, Zenoski said: "Do well, the Warriors!We see that Russia has made such a hysterical reaction to every step we take and every position we take. . The enemy knows that Ukraine will win. "

The bombed dam is located on the Dnieber River in 1956. It is about 30 meters high and a length of about 3.2 kilometers. The water storage capacity is equivalent to the Great Saltlake in UTAH. Part of the Kakov Kaqual Power Plant.

The reservoir not only supplies water for the Crimean Peninsula, but also supplies cooling water at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The nuclear power plant is also controlled by Russia.

The Ukraine National Nuclear Power Corporation (Energoatom) said today that the damage to the new Kakova dam pose a threat to the Zarari nuclear power plant, but the situation of the nuclear power plant has been controlled.

The Ukrainian National Nuclear Power Corporation pointed out that the Russian invaders bombed the dam and said that the water level of the new Kafka Reservoir was rapidly declining, which constituted a "additional threat" to the Zaupar -Nuclear Power Plant. Both Russia and Ukraine accused the other party of the reservoir.

The UN nuclear supervisory agency "IAEA" (IAEA) said on Twitter that it is closely monitoring the relevant situation, but "(Zapoli) nuclear power plants do not have an immediately nuclear safety risk."

Zenoski wrote on Telegram: "The damage to the dam damage of the new Kakov Katka hydraulic power station has proved to the world that they (Russian) must be expelled from every corner of the Ukrainian land."

It is unclear how this flood has affected the long -planned counterattack operation in Ukraine. This counterattack is expected to fight against the Russian army stationed in southern and east of Ukraine.

He warned Beijing that "it won't take long, someone will be hurt."

Before the White House issued a tough warning, the U.S. Navy announced a period of US missile destroyer, USS Chung-Hoon and the Royal Canadian Navy patrol ship Montreal(HMCSMontreal)On the 3rd, during the routine of crossing the Taiwan Strait, it was intercepted by the Chinese warship "unsafe" action.

"The frequency of these two incidents is higher than expected. Although not all are unsafe and unprofessional, these two are." Cerby said.

Although Beijing had previously rejected the United States 'suggestions on the meeting of the two countries' defense ministers during the "Shangri -La dialogue", Cerbine said, "The United States is committed to maintaining the smooth communication channels with China to clearly express these specific interception behaviors. accept."

Zhong Zhidong, an assistant researcher at the National Security Research Institute of the National Institute of Defense Security in Taiwan, told this station that the United States is doing the worst plans to take common actions with the allies: "Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea Security Internationalization, the concept and definition lies in avoiding cross -strait relations with Chinese internal affairs. It has been involved through international forces to counter Chinese tribes to solve the attempt and ability of Taiwan issues. "

"The so -called common position, implies that there is no country's willingness and ability to face the challenges of China's two regions in Taiwan and the South China Sea alone. This is the internationalization of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, and it can also be called the" international co -control "." Zhong Zhidong said.

** PLA operation marginal strategy? **

Taiwan's "Report" recently quoted the "China News" revealed that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ordered the PLA to operate the "marginal strategy" last month to increase the risk of friction in the sea and airspace in the "danger" model to increase the risk of friction in the sea and airspace in the "danger" model. Forced the United States and allies to retreat to avoid military conflicts, while strengthening nationalist emotions within China.

In response to the "Chinese Military Aircraft Intercepting U.S. Military Aircraft", he said, "The best way is to control your warships and control your plane."

The military commentator of this station pointed out: "If there is a so -called order of the Central Military Commission, it should be understood: if you encounter the provocation of the United States, he will never give up, be brave, dare to fight, and be good at struggle." He said, "(China)It will never take the initiative to increase the situation, which is relatively unfavorable to China, because the active increase proves that the instability of the South China Sea is a provocative action in China.

If the APEC is in November There is no better progress, it will probably be like this next year. "

Zhong Zhidong believes that the above -mentioned meetings of the United States and China do not represent the softening of the position, but they only clearly express their positions and do not misjudge both parties.

The official media announced the picture of the unveiling ceremony on Tuesday. President Ibrahim Lais and the senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) attended the unveiling ceremony. Domestic black missiles were clearly visible.

According to the official media, the movement speed of this missile can reach Mach 15 (5145 meters or 16,880 feet per second) and a range of 1400 kilometers (870 miles). Essence

According to media reports, Iran's highest leader Ayutola Ali Hammene chose the name and was roughly translated as a "enlightenment".

The movement speed of the hypersonic missile is five times or higher of the speed of sound, and it is strongly mobility. Therefore, the defense system and radar are difficult to attack this missile.

The United States, Russia, China and North Korea are considered the only country to successfully test the hypersonic missile, but the specific details of weapons and equipment are still very small.

Last November, Hargi Zard said that this new type of missile represents the "intergenerational leap" of Iran's missile technology because it can be mobilized inside and outside the earth's atmosphere and can penetrate any missile defense system.

The media reported on Tuesday that quoted Haggidad and reported that "Fartach cannot be destroyed by any other missiles because it moves in different directions and different heights."

The West and Israel have repeatedly expressed concerns about Iran's missile plans, saying that the country's ballistic missiles may be used to carry nuclear warheads -Tehran deny it.

The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards successfully tested a new type of ballistic missile with a range of 2000 kilometers (1240 miles) last month last month, which caused more criticism in the West.

Several young people have something to say **](https://wwwv.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/sc-05192023082534.html)*** [China's economy does not see the improvement of youth unemployment rates hit a record high](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/hcm1-05162023081528.html)**

Since the epidemic, China's economy is sluggish, and unemployment issues have attracted much attention. According to the Taiwan Central News Agency, the analysis article by Wang Mingyuan, a researcher at the Beijing Reform and Development Research Association on June 1st, the Chinese WeChat public account "Eleven of Finance and Economics" pointed out that there are three main problems in China's current unemployment statistics:

First, China's official employment standards are too low. The employment standard defined by the International Labor Organization is 10 hours a week. The United States is 15 hours a week. France is 20 hours a week. One hour's work income cannot support daily life, which is not an effective employment.

Secondly, although Chinese officials include rural household registration personnel into it when the unemployment rate of urban urban unemployment, because migrant workers are unable to afford high living costs to return to their hometowns after migrant workers are unable to afford high living costs, it is difficult to draw this group of urban unemployment surveys, resulting in data Disglement.

Third, China's current "flexible employees" are as high as 200 million, accounting for about 40%of the urban employment population. However, the social security participation rate of this group is less than 20%, and it is difficult to count the real employment situation through indicators such as unemployment insurance and unemployment registration.

China is currently not only facing unemployment problems, but also the employment situation is not optimistic. The latest data released by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security recently showed that in 2023, the number of Chinese college graduates will reach 11.58 million, a record high. The data of the National Bureau of Statistics of China also shows that in April this year, the national urban survey rate of unemployment was 5.2%; among the labor population 16 to 24 years old, the unemployment rate was as high as 20.4%. Statistics the highest level since the number.

The above -mentioned article analysis of WeChat public accounts said that after the three -year epidemic, China has accumulated about 15 million technical secondary schools and fresh graduates of colleges and universities. At the same time, the average employees of A -share listed companies have shrunk by 11.9%in the past three years. Data show that about 10%of enterprises have unemployment in employees. About 25 million young people from 16 to 24 years old are about 25 million. The article quoted Lu Feng, a professor at Peking University, pointed out that in the past three years, it is conservatively estimated that about 23 million migrant workers have returned to their hometown due to unemployment. Calculated by 60 % of young people, there are about 14 million people. "So, about 54 million youths have been unemployed since the epidemic."

The article also pointed out that conservative estimates are that the current unemployment population in China has increased by about 25 million-30 million people than before the epidemic, which is equivalent to 6.2%-7.5%of the total labor force participating in the employment market at this age, which is equivalent to all China all all China 2.8%-3.4%of the working age population.

As of now, this station has not yet independently verified the data provided by the WeChat public account and the author.

In this context, the tuition fees of Chinese universities rose. Most of the universities in China are publicly -organized, and it is seriously dependent on national financial funding.

According to a statement issued on Sunday (June 4), Shanghai's East China University of Technology has increased the tuition fees of some major primary science and engineering and sports, reaching 7700 yuan per year, and the tuition fees for liberal arts have increased by 30%.

According to a notice on Monday, the tuition fees of the Science and Technology of Shanghai Institute of Electrical Engineering rose 40%, while the tuition fees of students who maintained management and economy and literature increased by 30%.

On April 17 this year, Shanghai organized a hearing of optimizing the scientific fee formation mechanism for public colleges and universities. From the school year of 2023, the average tuition standard for public colleges and universities will be adjusted from 5,420 yuan per student to 7,215 yuan/ In the academic year, the amplitude amplitude is about 33%.

According to Reuters, after the hearing, Shanghai decided to raise tuition fees for public universities, and the tuition fee has not changed for more than 20 years.

Jilin Province, which is densely populated in Sichuan Province and Northeast China, also decided to increase tuition fees to varying degrees. According to the local government's statement, in Jilin Province, the tuition fees of "subordinates of universities do not exceed 15%, and the national and provincial first -class professional tuition fees can rise and do not exceed 10%."

However, the United Nations and Ukrainian officials believe that the actual number of injuries in Ukraine may be "far higher."

A few weeks after the incident, Rui Mei stood in front of the wreckage of his apartment building in Uman, and the air was still filled with a pungent smell. He expressed a simple appeal. Every victim of the war must be included in the list of casualties.

Rui Mei shed tears and said, "What we need is not only numbers, but also names, because no one should be forgotten."

Ukrainian official statistics show that since Russia launched an invasion last year, at least 1368 civilians were killed and 14,404 were injured.

Oleg Gavrysh, a senior adviser to Ukrainian Presidential Office, pointed out: "These are just people we know."

He also said: "We expect that the most likely situation is that the total number of casualties will be 5 times at present. In other words, the total number may reach 50,000."

Ukraine's incomplete data meets the statistics of civilian casualties in the latest period of the United Nations (UN). According to UN data, as of the end of April, there were 8,709 people killed and 14,666 were injured.

The United Nations also believes that the actual casualties may be "far higher."

The key to the difference in the number of casualties is because the lack of information about Russia's occupation land, such as Mariupol, a port city in southeastern Ukraine, is believed to have been killed by tens of thousands of civilians in the local area.

Experts are worried that even if Ukraine can recover the city, the murderers who kill civilians may have hidden evidence.

(Voice of Germany) NancyFaeser, German Federal Internal Affairs Minister, said in an interview with the Business Daily: "In my opinion, three security points involved in China involved in China rely."

She said, [Chinese spy operation](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/气球警醒德国宪法保护局称中国在德间谍行动增多/a-64673596)The "danger is getting greater" caused by the German economy, industry and scientific research.

"Business Daily" quoted [German security industry](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国三大情报机构警告不要对专制中国太天真/a-63472850)According to sources, investigators found that Chinese practices often participate in projects in German companies through scientific cooperation. Once a guest scholars obtain a channel to enter the enterprise IT system, they will try to get more information about these projects. For example, in 2020, a Chinese scientist used a spy operation against a medical technology company in northern Germany under the official instruction of Chinese officials. This case is still confidential. Safety people said that this is a typical case of a Chinese guest scholar caused the outflow of professional and technical knowledge in Germany.

From mid -2015 to May 2016, a doctoral student from China participated in the university research project team to get the opportunity to participate in this project. His interest in new technologies is obviously too high.

The company's new coating technology patent has been registered in China. This also confirmed the company's suspicion of the spy behavior of Chinese scholars' research results.

The article also pointed out that after returning to China, the scholar became a professor at Northwestern University of Technology. Northwestern University of Technology is one of the "National Defense Seven Sons", which has been specially supported by Chinese countries. These schools are at the forefront of military research in the People's Republic of China and have a close relationship with the military.

Ferizer called for strengthening security measures.

According to a U.S. monitoring research company, Dahua's artificial intelligence camera is designed to suppress protests. Andy Wong/Associated Press

_This surveillance technology is just an example of China's prevalence of artificial intelligence "predictive police". _ _ _ 吧 _

A Chinese company that provides camera surveillance technology and sanctioned by the Western governments has launched products. Combined with artificial intelligence technology, it can automatically notify the authorities when someone expands banners.

The first report, pointing out that the American information monitoring and research company IVPM, which has the product of Dahua Technology, said that the purpose of the artificial intelligence technology contained in the camera produced by Dahua Technology Co., Ltd. is obviously to make the protesters sound.

After IPVM made a request for comment on Dahua Technology, Dahua immediately deleted the context of "Jinn" in the product system. However, it can be seen in the versions of the existing Dahua Technology website that the company explained that the use of this technology is "social security" and "social governance" -These are common vocabulary that the Chinese authorities will monitor and arrest them rationally.

During the past few years during the new crown epidemic, this artificial intelligence technology and government tracking technology have been widely adopted in China, and this system of Dahua Technology is only one of the cases of rapid growth of this kind of AI technology.

Critics said that a large number of police in the police in China has significantly increased the ability of authorities to restrict social freedom, control the people, and suppress specific groups.

** "The system will send a warning" **

According to the [Dahua website access page](https://perma.cc/KRU6-DBBP?type=image)The artificial intelligence system was launched in 2021 and was put into use in May 2023.

The launch time of this system is exactly in line with the time point of the large -scale investment geographic information system throughout China in 2020.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T14-22-00-04-00/000001.png)On May 2, 2019, the Dahua surveillance camera installed on the Dahua Science and Technology Office of Hangzhou, China.

He said: "The development of banner alarm caters caters to the Chinese market: large government departments are usually police." "This system is intended to be used by the police or a certain form of urban authorities ... In short, unless you, unless you, you, unless you It is to track protests, otherwise it will be unreasonable to automatically track them (protest banner). "

In recent years, the most well-known protesting operation in China-the white paper movement that protests China's new crown zero policy-[is a man starting a protest banner on the overpass](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/ccp-bridgeman-10142022161722.html)\- This shows that the technology may be related to the police (although the police do not know whether the police use a banner tracking technology in this specific case).

Earlier, Dahua Technology's internal documents showed that the company provided facial recognition of artificial intelligence technology to track Uyghur people, which caused sanctions in Western countries. Dahua Technology denies specific ethnic groups.

Dahua's official website also posted a video shot in 2020 to demonstrate its artificial intelligence system to shoot the moral banner process, but the video was later deleted. The video commentary said, "If the person holding a banner is monitored within the scope of the camera, and the behavior continues for a long time, the system will send an alert to the police."

Dahua Technology did not respond to the requirements of Radio Free Asia for comments.

** Police technology equipment development wave **

Banner development monitoring technology is the continuation of the Chinese police exploring the "development of artificial intelligence and how the technology is put into use", and IPVM's Rules said.

China has collected a large number of people's data for a long time, and the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence technology provides the authorities with a new way to collect intelligence.

IPVM also received a copy of the purchase of artificial intelligence tracking system project for the Shanghai Public Security Solicitation of Artificial Intelligence Tracking System last month](https://s.ipvm.com/uploads/embedded_file/80c1a225f27aef8c9c1966e8d63e7eb5f556530e267ffe0acf7618fb5d592c9a/133d7b88-dba9-4137-8efa-0772938d2e19.pdf), Show the Chinese authorities intentionally using the collected large -scale data.

The purchase invitation notice description: "Traditional police work needs to be transformed into digital, intelligent, convenient, and simple online operation." This notice also said, "Effectively managing police operation models, making it the maximum effectiveness of the public security technology. solved problem."The project aims to create an automatic alarm system and notify the police to the police. Songjiang District is a densely populated suburbs, including a large number of scholars and college students.

The "target group" seeking automatic tracking includes Uighurs; foreigners with illegal residence; key universities and staff; foreign reporters in China; foreigners who have been to Xinjiang or other similar regions; those who accept new crown vaccines; Suspects, sex workers and drug trafficking; and families with unusual electricity consumption.

According to the later removal notice, the Songjiang Public Security Bureau handed over the project to Shanghai Jiyi Technology Development Company, which obviously specialized in contracting government contracts.

Shanghai Jiyi Technology Development Company did not respond to the request of this station.

Like Dahua Technology Company, the Songjiang District Public Security Bureau removed the bidding announcement after the IPVM announced the investigation report in May, and Radio Free Asia could not contact the project manager listed in the notice to seek comments.

** The limit of "Big Brother" **

Wang Songlian, a human rights observation of international human rights organizations headquartered in New York, said that the 26 categories of "target groups" listed in the Shanghai project are the "key persons" identified by the Chinese authorities.

Wang Songlian told Radio Free Asia that "petitioners, former subjects, social psychological disabilities, etc. have been subject to the police" and technical monitoring.

The parameters they use -tracking the expansion of the banner or the increase in the power consumption of the household (in the bidding project of the Shanghai Public Security) -often the method of pushing, from those behaviors that may be prohibited. Find out -of -the -art behavior to be suppressed by the authorities, such as protests or mining to find cryptocurrencies.

"This reminds me of the era when China began to use a large number of technical monitoring methods in 2016 and 2017." Kane said: "They will track those who suddenly start smoking or drink, or they suddenly buy people who can make tent materials.

"And there is no specific reason for such tracking. They only say that this kind of behavior is suspicious. It sounds like it is unusual as if they choose a few behaviors at will," he said.

"It seems that the authorities are reversed. First, there is a result, so I can put it for a reason."

** Discrimination and danger **

But these police measures have a real impact on the targeted ethnic groups.

In particular, the Chinese official large -scale monitoring of the Uighurs' behaviors is the key factor that enables the official to persecute the Uyghur people, and Wang Songlian, the human rights observation organization.

"No matter where the Uyghur people go to China, they will be subject to discrimination and targeted law enforcement by local public security," Wang Songlian said.

This article entitled "Force" wrote:

"These people are detained by the police because they have to commemorate a historical crime committed by the Communist Party of China 34 years ago: at that time, the Chinese Communist Party ordered that the college students who requested democracy on Tiananmen Square to shoot. The suppression operation of the PLA caused hundreds of people with hundreds of or even thousands of people.

To this day, the Chinese government is still not allowed to reflect on the incident. However, the CCP uses news review and national violence to remove this incident from the collective memory of the mainland people, at least in Hong Kong, people can commemorate this tragedy. On June 4th each year, thousands of people go to Victoria Garden to mourn the undead in the form of candlelight party.

But this Sunday, the place where the mourning ceremony was held was occupied by the Beijing organization: [They organized a carnival event here under the protection of hundreds of police officers.

"In China, the incident of bloody suppression of Peking University Student Movement seems to have never happened. There is no relevant news, and there is no relevant entry on the Internet encyclopedia, and there is no relevant discussion on social media. A picture of a candle was posted on Weibo, but the relevant posts were deleted a few minutes later.

If you want to visit the place where you can visit (34th suppression), you must go through the heavy level set by the police. At noon on Sunday, more than a dozen tourists on Tiananmen Square are taking selfies, and they seem to be a student. When the tank opened in Beijing in 1989, they were not born. They may not know what happened 34 years ago. "

If China has achieved the control and blockade of the Taiwan Strait, its impact on the supply chain will be far greater than the impact of the new crown epidemic and the Russian and Ukraine War, and it will also hit the world economy. Can the United States have the ability to deal with large -scale conflicts between Ukraine and Taiwan at the same time? This will be an adventure.

In any case, Europe should be prepared for this turbulent era. The Indo -Pacific region will be the world's core of the 21st century. The earlier Europe re -shows its position, and the results will be better. After all, Europe has appeared to be too slow on the problem of looking for new partners in Africa.

Europe and the West cannot be late again, and the struggle for the new order of the world has been fully launched. "

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-06T14-32-10-00-00/000000.png)As a constitutional monarchy, the United Kingdom should survive politics. Most members of the British royal family follow this approach to avoid publicly criticizing the power government.

However, Prince Harry, who is now moving to the United States, belongs to the self -exile, but has fired the long -term issues of the government and news media in the lawsuit of the "Mirror GroupNewspapers".

The official title of Harry, the official title of Duke of Sussex, stated in the witness confession of the London High Court that he filed the lawsuit because of the grievances with trivial revenge.

He said that instead he wanted to "accurately accuse the privileges and strength of the hijacking media", "using illegal or unauthorized means of obtaining legal authorization to obtain benefits and promoting issues."

The 38 -year -old Harry said those who were responsible for "unchanged willingness", so they must be exposed to avoid other people to bear the same destiny as him.

He said, "From the perspective of the national level, at this stage, the world judges my country with the situation of media and the government, and I think the two are at the lowest point."

Prince Harry said, "When the media fails to supervise the government and investigate the government's responsibility, but in order to maintain the status quo, they choose to combine with the government, and democracy fails."

British national newspapers are mainly right, tending to support the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

Critics have stated that this has caused many reports on political issues to have a biased position, including whether the United Kingdom wants to leave the European Union's Brexit debate.

Sunak's official spokesman refused to comment on the criticism of Prince Harry.

The World Bank issued the latest global economic outlook report on the 6th. The report talks about East Asia and the Pacific(EAP)Regional growth is expected to say that the growth of East Asia and the Pacific region is expected to increase from 3.5%in 2022 to 5.5%in 2023 because China's recovery offsets the slowdown of most other regional economies. After the economy is reappearing faster than expected, China's growth expectations have been raised this year, which has boosted recent consumer expenditures, especially in terms of service. The region, which does not include China, will slow from 5.8% in 2022 to 4.8% in 2023, because the re -opening up of several large economies in advance is fading. Due to the weak global demand and China's domestic service -led growth, regional trade growth will remain sluggish. By 2024, with the influence of China's re -opening up, EAP's growth rate is expected to slow to 4.6%.

Given that China focuses on domestic service activities, it is expected that the positive spillover effect of China's recovery will be limited.

The report pointed out that China's real estate industry is facing special downlink risks. Although the authorities provide liquidity support to real estate developers, they have made a small progress in reorganizing debt in the way of restoring the health of the industry. In the context of the slowdown in urban population growth, the weakness of China's real estate industry may continue.

The report also pointed out that geopolitical tensions may increase and increase uncertainty. For China, the tension has interrupted some forms of high -tech manufacturing products, especially semiconductors and related materials. Other countries in the region are easily affected by the intensification of the tensions between China and the United States, because they have close trade and financial connections with these two economies, and are widely integrated into the global value chain.

[** Chinese university tuition fees increase up to 54%**](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/2-06062023105005.html)Reuters disclosed on June 5 that due to the reduction of national higher education budgets and local fiscal tensions, China has recently increased its tuition fees sharply, and the tuition fees in some colleges have been raised for the first time in 20 years. The report pointed out that Chinese universities are almost dependent on public universities that seriously depend on national funding, but after three years of rigorous epidemic prevention policies, real estate crises and economic downturn, local governments have been unable to subsidize colleges and universities in colleges and universities due to fiscal tightening.

The news of raising college tuition fees in many provinces and cities in China has aroused fierce discussions on the cost of running schools in colleges and universities. On the social media platform Weibo, some netizens said that fiscal appropriations are not enough, "actually starting from college tuition fees, I can only say haha"; some netizens believe that the increase in tuition fees is too high to students of poor families, and higher education may change fears change. Become an elite education, "There must be a bunch of people who can't afford to learn." In addition, public opinion is also concerned about the issues of universities or scholarships.

According to statistics from Reuters, Shanghai East China University of Technology has increased the tuition fees of some science, engineering and sports majors to 7,700 yuan on Sunday, an increase of 54%; tuition fees for liberal arts majors have risen by 30%. In addition, the scientific fee of science and engineering in Shanghai Electric Power University also rose 40%, while the tuition fees for management, economics and literature increased by 30%compared with the same period last year.

In the past two decades, colleges and universities in Shanghai have never raised tuition fees. In April of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Government organized a hearing of the "Optimizing the Formation Mechanism of the College of Public Universities". The education department mentioned that the average tuition fee of the special colleges of public universities this year was about 33%.

Not only is the so -called economic and financial centers transfer tuition fees, but in other densely populated provinces in China, the tuition fees for colleges and universities are also "rising".

According to the relevant announcement of local governments, as of now, universities in Jilin, Shandong, Shaanxi and other places have also announced the adjustment of tuition fees for universities. Among them, Sichuan rose the largest, up to 41%.

Reuters quoted a budget report issued by the Ministry of Education of China, saying that in 2023, the expenditure of higher education budgets in the Ministry of Education of China decreased by 3.7%year -on -year to 102.6 billion yuan. Professor Liu Jin and his team of Beijing Institute of Technology also suggested last month that the tuition fees for international students studying in China will increase from about 20,000 yuan per year to 110,000 yuan.

After this song has recently been mistaken for the "Hong Kong National Anthem" by international sports events, the Hong Kong Government officially applied to the court to prohibit anyone from spreading this song. What impact will the Hong Kong government's move bring?

"Why this land, tears reappear; why make everyone, but also resentful ..." "Glory to Hongkong" (Glory to Hongkong ", this first fighting song in 2019, once sounded. The streets and lanes in Hong Kong may be the first "ban song" since the opening of Hong Kong in the future.

The Hong Kong Department of Justice applied to the High Court forbidden to make a ban, prohibiting anyone from spreading, playing, printing, publishing, selling, distributing, spreading or displaying the song "Wish Relief to Hong Kong" on the Internet or any platform. , Inciting others to split the country; or have "incite intention" and advocate the separation of Hong Kong from China. The scope of the prohibition includes song melody, lyrics, and even adapted versions.

** Article 32 of the Hong Kong Government List "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" films with hand language and various language versions **

The enrollment of the Hong Kong Department of Justice also said that "Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" may be mistaken for "Hong Kong National Anthem", or that Hong Kong is an "independent country" with the national anthem, which is intended to insult the national anthem and violate the "National Anthem Regulations" in Hong Kong. A total of 32 "Wish Glory Back to Hong Kong" related YouTube videos, including pure music version, orchestra version, sign language version, and different languages such as English and German, requiring relevant persons to stop spread immediately.

The Hong Kong Government later issued a statement explaining, pointing out that the lyrics of "Wanting to Return to Hong Kong" contain slogans that have been incited by the court, and have been mistakenly expressed as "Hong Kong National Anthem" recently, which has insulted the national anthem and caused the country and the Special Economic Zone. Serious damage, emphasizing that in order to maintain national security, the application is necessary, reasonable and legal, and meet the requirements of the relevant human rights bill.

** Try to ban the song by the court program **

Former Hong Kong District Councilor Liu Jiawen, the former Hong Kong district, told this station that since the implementation of the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District, the Hong Kong Government has continuously suppressed the culture and art world with tangible or intangible hands; Disposal, many movies cannot be released in Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong government officially applied for a specific song for a specific song, but for the first time. She believes that it will make a very bad precedent.

Liu Jiawen said: "With my memory, this should be the first time that the government uses court procedures to apply for a ban on this song to be released or played in Hong Kong. Of course With the first precedent, many different publishing freedom and cultural freedom will be suppressed after that. "

At present, the relevant prohibited order application is waiting for the court's instructions, and the hearing date is to be determined. Huang Weiguo, assistant professor of the former assistant professor of the Department of Political and International Relations of the Hong Kong Baptist University in the UK, told the station that the ruling of the Hong Kong court will release important information to the international community.

Huang Weiguo said: "If the court really presented the play" Wish Rongguang to Hong Kong ", it can be said that since the opening of Hong Kong's port, the government has expressed its first explicit regulations. There is no existence, and it collapses further. "

The Hong Kong Government has not pointed out what incite slogans containing the lyrics of "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong", but there is a sentence in the song "Dawn comes, to recover, this Hong Kong; peers, children, the revolution of the times." The defendant Tang Yingjie, the first defendant who was sentenced to 9 years in Hong Kong by the National Security Law, was judged that the power of his motorcycles was hanging the banner of "restoring Hong Kong, the Revolution of the Times", and pointed out that the slogan could "incite others to split the country" Essence

** How much is the actual role in blocking the "Broadcasting National Anthem" in international competitions? **

Since last year, when the Hong Kong team played the international sports competition, it repeatedly made a storm of "Broadcasting the wrong National Anthem" -the organizer mistakenly regarded "Wish Rongguang to Hong Kong" as "Hong Kong National Anthem", not the Chinese national anthem "The Volunteer March". The Hong Kong Government asked Google to "top" the Volunteer Army when searching for "Hong Kong National Anthem", but was rejected by Google.

Huang Weiguo believes that the situation of the "National Anthem" of the international sports events embarrassed the Hong Kong government, so he intended to prevent the ban from spreading "willing to glory to Hong Kong", so that it ranked after the internet search results in the middle of the hall to avoid the error in the international competition organizers. However, he believes that the approach of the Hong Kong government is "covering the ears and stealing the bell", because the Hong Kong government cannot control the results of the online search results of foreign users, and Hong Kong people in Hong Kong can still search for information such as VPN and other ways to "underground" circulating collective memories of Hong Kong people. Essence

Former Hong Kong District Councilor Guo Zijian, a former Hong Kong District Councilor, stated that "Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" appeared during the 2019 Rebellion and spread all over the world. Although it is not the official national anthem of Hong Kong Represents Hong Kong people.** Overseas law enforcement is difficult **

Tang Jiazhen, a member of the executive committee of a senior barrister, said that if the court issued a ban, the offender can be charged with "contempt of the court" and sentenced to 7 years in prison. He believes that the safest way of citizens is to delete related songs that have been downloaded or still retained. However, he acknowledged that there was some difficulties in overseas law enforcement.

Liu Jiawen said that "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" is not only the "iconic" song of the 2019 resistance movement. At present, in the activities of overseas Hong Kong people, it also plays an important role. The entry point of the interaction.

She believes that even if the Hong Kong court issued a ban order, overseas Hong Kong people's organizers will not have concerns about playing "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong". They believe that Britain is a free and democratic country, and Hong Kong people can express their opinions freely. The participants of the event will also evaluate the risks by themselves and protect themselves in different ways. I believe that the ban will not have much impact on overseas Hong Kong people.

The content is the theme of the "Four, the essence of the Sino -US dispute" of the above article. From 4 minutes and 33 seconds, it receives other parts of the article.

He compared the audio of "Qin Gang Recording" and "Sixth Brother Life" circulating on the Internet, and found that the ups and downs of the two audio were consistent; Yes, the two are likely to be the same audio.

Asian facts investigation laboratory asked the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy in the United States on June 5th. The recording of the Internet was Qin Gang's voice, but the interruption of the draft has not yet been replied.

**in conclusion:**

Although Chinese officials have not responded, the Asian facts check the laboratory failed to further confirm the authenticity of the audio, but Qin Gang reads an article released by the Internet author last year internally, and his tone, accent, and words are "coincident" and shaking The same possibility of sound users is quite low.

After comparison of online articles, Douyin videos, and sound pattern recognition, the Asian factual investigation laboratory believes that the so -called Qin Gang internal speech recording circulating on the Internet is likely not to say what Qin Gang said, but after someone edited the existing videos of the Internet on the Internet , Crown Qin Gang's name, spread error information.

** The youth season of Shanghai Fengcheng: June 4th and his ** ** "History of Anti -Thief" ** **

Ji Xin is a Shanghai youth in his early 20s who came to study in the United States last year. Since the outbreak of the white paper movement, he has experienced Shanghai Fengcheng, and has been actively joining various political discussion groups on the Internet to communicate with young resistance. He also participated in a online mourning June 4th this year. Activity. He told reporters that he heard June 4th at the age of eight at the age of eight: "I was playing in the park that was playing in the park that year. When I was resting, I heard adults chat. They said that there were a group of people on the streets of Beijing many years ago. The march, the army swept the gun and the tank was pressed. "

The discussion of adults caused his younger curiosity at the time. He stepped forward and tried to ask those adults more questions. He described the situation at that time, "I asked questions and asked what year it happened in them and why was this. Adults found that I was a strange child who came to listen to it. Play yourself. "

From then on, this experience was very strange about dodging this adult's dodging. After that, why did this adult unwilling to say, what happened to this matter became what he wanted to figure out. Just a few years later, he had a chance, and it came from a "negligence" from his father. Ji Xin said, one day: "I found my dad's computer on the computer, and found a folder called the" June 4th Luck "on his desktop. Photos protested by the Monument to the People's Heroes, such as the photos of the tank tracked on the streets of Beijing, and the photos of the people in front of Tiananmen. "

很快，他的父亲就知道了这件事。而父亲的恐慌，则令他印象深刻。他回忆道：“他很慌张让我什么都不要说。过几年我又学会了翻墙，第一天我就把三小时的《天安门》纪录片看完了。那是2016、17年左右，我才对六四事件有完全的了解。”

季新所提到的纪录片，就是那部由卡玛执导，在1995年上映的《天安门》。在这之后，他感到自己应该把关于那段课本上不存在的历史告诉更多同学。按照年轻人中惯用的词语，他成了一名“反贼”。他说道：“所以那个时候我经常给我的同学科普，讲六四是怎么来的，以及六四发生以后具体发生了什么事，也给他们听歌，比如《自由花》，把照片、影像给他们看。那时候，我还把维基百科上六四、刘晓波(的内容)打印出来，分发给他们。”

他也表示，他发现他的同学们几乎都不知道六四是怎么回事，并在听了他的介绍后，感到那些在六四屠杀中遇难的学生很可怜。

**00后肖雅洁：白纸运动对八九的传承和超越**

出生在2000年的肖雅洁，在小学时随父母从大陆移民到了香港。她告诉记者，2010年，也就是她刚去香港的第一年，就接触到了与六四有关的活动：“当时香港的政治方向还是很自由的，每个学校都会举办六四的纪念活动。我在香港上学的那几年，每一年我们学校都会有自发性的活动，大家一起去礼堂悼念学生。无论我在小学还是初中的时候，我们都会有烛光晚会。”

She said that at that time, she didn't think deeply about June 4th. What really made her feel impact in 2016. That year, she had gone to study in the UK, and her parents participated in the June 4th candlelight mourning activities in Victoria Garden, Hong Kong, and met mainland tourists who denied the history of June 4th. She said: "My parents told me these things. I think the mainlanders have been deceived too much, which makes me have a deep impression on June 4th."

In the summer vacation in 2019, she had come to the United States to continue her studies and returned to Hong Kong to participate in the counterclocking of the Chinese parade. This is also the first time she really devoted himself to the fighting movement. She said that on the streets of Hong Kong at the time, she had sucked into the tear bomb, and she also saw that the white man who was a member of the authorities would paralyze from the demonstrators from the upstairs. At present, she is working in Los Angeles, USA, and also participates in the support activities of white paper movements.

Xiao Yajie told reporters that in her eyes, there is a relationship between the eight or nine democratic movements and the white paper movement: "The white paper movement is more like the inheritance of the 64th college students. Because although the person who may initiate the white paper sports, not everyone knows the June 4th of June 4th In the past, but in fact, our bones are eager to be free and democratic. "

她也把这两场运动进行了对比，认为发生在信息时代的白纸运动能使更多人觉醒，并说道：“白纸运动是封城导致的，反映中共没有办法用更强硬的手段做出让我们捂嘴的事情了。这是一场更胜于六四的民主运动，因为在当时这么高压的情况下，还有一群勇敢的人站出来。”

**南加州大学学生王涵：从邓小平到习近平，中共实际上没有任何变化**

在今年26岁、深度参与了白纸运动的南加州大学学生王涵的心目中，六四屠杀和近年中国当局进行的“动态清零”、封城政策一样，都是一种需要所有人共同反抗的极权暴政。他说：“就是我之前一直和很多人讲的，我觉得在面对极权暴政的时候，所有人都应该站在一起。”

王涵表示，在江泽民、胡锦涛的时代，那时非常年少的他对中国的看法和现在有所不同：“江胡时代，我也是不支持中国共产党的，但是当时我很天真地觉得这个国家会变好。有点像台湾，大家在一步一步地往前走，最终让民进党执政，我觉得我能看到那样的希望。”

他说，尽管他在小学的时候就知道六四，但对他更为决定性的冲击则是之后发生的事：“2018年习近平修改宪法对我是非常震撼的事情，19年的香港反送中运动更激励了我，之后就是武汉肺炎的事情，一件一件。”

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-34-00-04-00/000007.png)Chinese student Wang Han.(Wang Han video screenshot)After that, he no longer thought that China could "improve" in a way in Taiwan. He believes that compared with the Kuomintang before the democratization of Taiwan: "the Communist Party's destruction of Chinese grass -roots social organizations is more serious and the totalitarian level is higher. Therefore, I don't think it is possible to change the tyranny through normal improvement demands. Go to change the tyranny. "

In addition, he has a new understanding of the history of the Communist Party in nearly 30 years. He used a metaphor to describe his view of the CCP's internal faction: "Like fighting with brothers, for example, China Mobile competes with China Telecom, and the competition is 'their own brothers'.

He further explained his point of view: "I don't think that the CCP's regime has changed from beginning to end. Xi Jinping and Deng Xiaoping's concepts are different. They are also the Communist Party and Marxism. In the subconscious and rooted in their ideas, I don't think there is anything different. "

South Korea's United Staff Headquarters (joint ginseng) said that four Chinese military planes and four Russian military planes once entered the air defense identification zone (defense zone, Kadiz) in southern and eastern waters in South Korea, and did not invade South Korea.

Comprehensive Yonhap News Agency and Reuters reported that China and Russia were over the sixth time since 2019, and the sixth joint air patrol since 2019. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said that the patrol was part of the annual cooperation plan of the two countries.

The air defense identification zone does not equal airspace. It is an airspace defined by a country based on air defense needs. It aims to provide conditions for early discovery, identification and implementation of the air force interception operations of the military. According to international practice, military planes should submit the flight plan in advance before entering the other national defense zone and announce the flying position.

In May and November last year, China -Russia military aircraft entered the South Korean air defense identification zone twice. In January this year, two Chinese military aircraft flew into the South Korean defense zone from the southwest of the island and evacuated.

US Secretary of Defense Lloydaustin mentioned at the Shangri -La Safety Dialogue Conference that establishing a direct dialogue mechanism between the United States and China is quite important. China's national strength is strengthening, and the military friction in the United States and China shows unprecedented tension. Both sides are both sides. The possibility of military misjudgment is gradually increasing. "

Campbell said: "During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union had established effective communication pipelines. When the expected crisis occurred, the two sides could coordinate. But we could not do so with China, and China was unwilling to interact with the United States ... ... Chinese warships have recently carried out dangerous navigation steering in an attempt to block the US military's escort operation in the Taiwan Strait, which highlights the importance of the existence of the direct dialogue mechanism. "

At the meeting, Campbell also talked about the stance of the Biden government on the issue of Taiwan, and reiterated that the United States was committed to maintaining the status quo of the Taiwan Strait: "We realize Taiwan's major achievements in democracy and science and technology. We support these achievements and hope to maintain it ... ... … We must be careful of misjudgment or military accidents in the Taiwan Strait, which may lead to the consequences of expected. The current goal of the United States is to ensure that it is strong and clear to China, and at the same time, it is also avoiding the conflict that causes the conflict. "

The outside world noticed that the Chinese military's provocative attitude towards the United States coincided with the 34th anniversary of the June 4th incident. Ye Yaoyuan, director of the Department of International Studies and Contemporary Linguistics of St. Tomas University in the United States, told reporters in an interview with this station that the Beijing authorities may intend to disperse the people's attention to the June 4th incident with military events: "It (Chinese government) may want to borrow borrowing It is a possibility to guide domestic public opinion by a more provocative demonstration. Another possibility is that China has recently been very dissatisfied with the trend of the internationalization of the United States. It may be more dangerous and provocative. Actions come to express the disgust with the United States. "

In response to the concerns about China ’s contradictions about domestic social contradictions, Ye Yaoyuan believes that the war will make Beijing a huge cost, and at the same time, the Chinese army’ s war experience is not enough. Therefore, the possibility of launching the war on Taiwan in the short term is The Communist Party of China faces the disadvantages that cannot be reversed in China, or the challenge to the regime is very obvious, otherwise it will generally not do this (attack Taiwan). "

** Campbell: The goal of the United States is not to restrict China's rise **

Campbell also emphasized at the seminar that the international order established by the United States has prompted the Indo -Pacific region to experience unprecedented prosperity in the past 50 years, and the local people have left poverty. Although China often accuses the United States of intentionally obstructing China to become regional hegemony, in fact, the goal of the United States is to defend the existing international order to ensure that the Indo -Pacific region can enjoy continuous peace and prosperity.

Campbell said: "As a rising country, it will not unexpectedly want to change the existing order, such as economic coercion or unilateral territorial declaration. These changes make the United States and Indo -Pacific countries worry. Prosperity has caused great harm. Therefore, what the United States wants to do is to maintain a good international system now.

The Bangladesh Meteorological Bureau warned that there was no signs of high temperature. Scientists say that climate change is promoting hot waves in summer more frequently, seriousness and longness.

Hamid said on Facebook on Monday (June 5) in Facebook: "Due to the surge in the global energy crisis and the international currency market, we face this unnecessary reduction problem."

Bangladesh's power outage in recent months has led to economic recovery, especially the key clothing industry that accounts for more than 80%of total exports.

The Paris Arbitral Court of France sentenced the Malaysian government on Tuesday (June 6) to win the lawsuit, so they did not have to pay attention to this claim.
