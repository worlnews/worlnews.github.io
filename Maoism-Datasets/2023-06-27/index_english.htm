<h3>Gates and Musk why are they received in China in China</h3>

<p>Beijing Street TV is playing Xi Jinping to meet with Gates.</p>
<p><strong> In half a month, Tesla's CEO (CEO) Elon Musk and Microsoft founder Billgates visited China successively. High -standard receptions aroused attention -Musk, in the 44 -hour visit to China, densely met with Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Qin Gang, Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong, and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. </strong></p>
<p>Reuters quoted people familiar with the matter and said that Musk also met with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Ding Xuexiang before leaving China, and the meeting did not appear in public schedule and foreign reports. Ding Xuexiang has long been considered Xi Jinping's chief of staff. After the 20th National Congress, he ranked among the Standing Committee of the Politburo and served as the executive vice prestigious of the State Council.</p>
<p>Bill Gates sat with Xi Jinping and talks face -to -face. Xi Jinping said to him, "You are the first American friend I met in Beijing this year." Previously, Xi Jinping met with Gates twice in Boao, Hainan. The first visit to the United States in 2015 also met with him in Seattle.</p>
<p>Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, visited China in March. At that time, he met with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and was officially elected from Li Qiang at the "two sessions."</p>
<p>But on the other hand, well -known foreign companies such as Deloitte, Micron, Bain, Mingz, and Anstela Pharmaceutical in Japan have been densely suppressed by the Chinese government this year. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also issued a report saying that it is increasingly worried about the negative impact of geopolitical disputes on the business in China.</p>
<p>So why do Gates and Musk enjoy super -standard treatment in China? Why do the Chinese government treat different foreign companies differently? Under the increasingly tense relationship between China and Europe and the United States, do Chinese and foreign companies still need each other?</p>
<h3>"Catfish Effect"</h3>
<p>"Tesla and Apple are like 'catfish". "A scholar who has been teaching in business schools in China and Hong Kong for a long time introduced to the BBC in Chinese that the sardines in the fishing boats were almost dead. They were all alive, because the captain threw a catfish inside to stimulate the desire to survive, but survived. This is the "catfish effect", that is, in an ecosystem, a strong man is introduced, which will inspire the weak to become stronger.</p>
<p>[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65981944/P0DVV8F5/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65981944/p0dvv8f5/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-26T02-17-09.000Z/p0dvvbh9.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>Tesla's price cut twice in March to protest</p>
<p>Tesla is particularly the same. As the earliest and fastest companies in this industry, after entering China, the entire industry chain has been required to be low -cost. Zeng Yuqun in the Ningde era complained that Tesla is radically requested that they have fallen cost. It also dropped again.</p>
<p>This "catfish" has made China's entire electric vehicle industry chain less cost and higher efficiency. Although the domestic market competition has intensified, its external competitiveness has strengthened.</p>
<p>"In the process of in -depth participation in globalization, China has won the title of 'World Factory' very early. However, China has very few self -owned industrial manufacturing products occupy a place in the international market. Of course, there are many, but this is all home appliances, and it cannot be regarded as a large industrial manufacturer. "Anbang think tank said in an analysis sent to BBC in Chinese that the problem reflects that although China is a manufacturing industry with large -scale manufacturing capabilities Big power, but not a real manufacturing power.</p>
<p>"This situation has begun to change now, and it first appears in the automotive field," said Anbang Think Tank.</p>

<p>Musk arrived in China by his private jet, and this trip was highly confidential.</p>
<p>In fact, China has become the world's largest exporter of electric vehicle. According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), about 35%of the global exported electric vehicles in 2022 came from China, and this ratio in 2021 was 25%. This year, the volume continued. In April, the export of new energy vehicles in China reached 91,000, an increase of 1028.5%year -on -year, an increase of 29.4%month -on -month, accounting for 31%of the passenger vehicle export volume.</p>
<p>Similar examples also occur in the smartphone industry. In 2007, Apple launched a cross -era smartphone iPhone. At that time, Cook was the core trader behind the Apple's supply chain system. Apple continued to send top technicians from China to buy customized devices for billions of dollars for suppliers to buy billions of dollars for billions of dollars for suppliers, so as to drop billions of dollars for suppliers to buy more than billions of dollars for suppliers, so as to throw billions of dollars for suppliers to buy more than billions of dollars for suppliers to buy customs billions of dollars for suppliers, so as to throw billions of dollars to supplie Developing some exclusive technologies; even in order to achieve the integration of laptop shells, Apple bought almost all of the world's most advanced CNC machine tools in the world, and they appeared collectively in Chinese factories a few months later.</p>
<p>When Cook first appeared in the CEO position in 2011, only eight Chinese companies in the 156 suppliers of Apple. Under his governance, in the top 200 main suppliers of Apple in 2020, 96 Chinese manufacturers reached 96.</p>
<p>These companies involved in the Apple supply chain system are called "fruit chains" companies. They cover important components such as screens, antennas, sensors, and cameras. After the Apple buying period, they can sell technology to Chinese companies.</p>
<p>Although the saying "Apple eats meat and drinks soup" in the industry, under the blessing of this supply chain, China's smartphone companies reached the pinnacle of 522 million units in 2015, accounting for 40%of the global market.</p>
<p>Under the influence of Apple, this "catfish", Chinese mobile phone manufacturers have used half -years in a relatively high -end field for eight years. China hopes Tesla can also achieve similar effects.</p>

<p>Cook visited China in March. In addition to Prime Minister Li Qiang, he also met the Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao.### "Stolen Fire"</p>
<p>"For China, Bill Gates is more like a 'stolen fireman'. There may be exaggerated components, and many people may disagree. But he comes earlier enough, and when he comes, it is the giant posture." The above Scholars say.</p>
<p>"Fire stolen" comes from Greek legends, that is, Prometheus, stolen fire species from the sun god Aparta for human beings.</p>
<p>In 1994, Bill Gates arrived in China for the first time and promoted Windows 95 into the Chinese market.</p>
<p>In China at that time, computers were fresh stuff. They even heard the Internet. Until 1995, Ma Yun, who was 31 years old, first came into contact with the Internet. At this time, Bill Gates was 39 years old. The position of the richest man in the world has been maintained for 13 consecutive years.</p>
<p>Just two years later, the Microsoft Asia Research Institute settled in China. This is the second basic scientific research institution opened by Microsoft overseas. It is the largest research institution in Microsoft outside the United States.</p>
<p>This decision has benefited the Chinese science and technology industry, because this research institute has later become the "Huangpu Military Academy" in the Chinese science and technology industry, and has produced a long string of well -known scientific and technological talents: Li Kaifu, Zhang Yaqin, Shen Xiangyang, Zhang Hongjiang, Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning, and Huang Changning, and Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning, and Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,,,, Huang Changning, Huang Changning,, Wang Jian, Li Shipeng, Lin Bin, Zhu Wenwu, Tang Xiaoou, Sun Jian, etc. Behind them are Baidu, Alibaba, Shangtang Technology, Viewing, Xiaomi, Tencent Science and Technology News, and other Chinese cloud computing and artificial intelligence fields Essence</p>
<p>But when these occurred, Bill Gates retired from Microsoft in 2008 and turned its main energy to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to start charity.</p>
<p>The outside world rarely noticed that Gates still retained a title at the time, the chairman of the US Tyra Energy Corporation. There was a contact with Chinese leader Xi Jinping through this company.</p>
<p>In 2014, the website of the National Energy Administration of China published an article entitled "Bill Gates Talking Nuclear Energy". In this interview, Gates said, "It is Tyra Energy Company ... … This company has an innovative design that can greatly improve the safety performance of nuclear energy, so that nuclear energy can be a very exciting way, which can provide large -scale, safe, and clean energy. "Gates said that this nuclear energy technology is doing the line. The wave reactor and hope to successfully build a demonstration heet by 2023.</p>

<p>Bill Gates: Reaching the global greenhouse gas zero emissions "will be the most powerful thing humans have done."</p>
<p>Less than a month after being elected as the President of the State in 2013, Xi Jinping attended the Hainan Boao Forum for Asia and met Bill Gates during this event.</p>
<p>In 2015, Xi Jinping talked with Gates again in one -on -one in Boao. In the same year, Xi Jinping visited the United States for the first time after he came to power. One of them was Gates's Big Camp Seattle. There, the two had private talks. According to the documentary "Decoding Bill Gates", this talks were a breakthrough, and the two sides signed a contract. In September 2017, Gates and China Nuclear Group set up a joint venture with Global Innovation Nuclear Energy Technology Co., Ltd., each holding 50%of its shares. It seems to be bound to build the first fourth -generation nuclear reactor in China to build the first fourth -generation nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>However, after Trump came to power, the Sino -US trade war also started at this time, and the bilateral relations between China and the United States deteriorated rapidly. On October 11, 2018, the U.S. Department of Energy announced the "Framework of the United States' Nuclear Energy Project for China". In the ideal fetus of the fourth -generation nuclear reactor in China, Cat, in this regard, Gates' partner in Tyra energy said, "We have always knew that there will be a political impact, but never thought it was from our own. government".</p>
<p>Visiting China in 2019, Gates did not meet Xi Jinping. Since then, the new crown epidemic broke out. In February 2020, Xi Jinping replied to Gates and thanked him for his support for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia.</p>
<p>In the following three years, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China experienced strict control, "white paper revolution", and economic turbulence; Gates was trapped in a scandal of associated with sexual criminals, as well as divorce with his wife Melinda.</p>
<p>In 2023, the two met again after a lapse of four years, but in public reports, they did not mention energy cooperation again.</p>
<p>"I put a Microsoft Research Institute in China in the 1990s. In the past few years, I wanted to put a new type of nuclear power plant in China, so I called him 'stolen people'." The above scholars said that in the final analysis, China wants to be a big country, whether Cook, Musk, or Gates, can help China get rid of the low level of the industry and complete the "big country dream", and can be received by hyperpost.</p>

<p>Unlike many peers, Apple has a huge market share in China.</p>
<h3>Demand and vigilance under Sino -US relations</h3>
<p>It is not difficult to observe that not all foreign capitals can get water like American companies such as Tesla and Apple.</p>
<p>Colmraffrty, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM China), told the Chinese media that the global anti -risk capabilities of SMEs and US -funded enterprises are relatively weak, so many of the epidemic have closed Chinese business; coupled with strict control in recent years In the following, it is even more difficult to enter China on the spot. New decisions to enter China or expand production and investment are even more difficult. Few new enterprises enter China.</p>
<p>Foreign companies seem to be worrying in China. According to data from the Statistics Bureau of China, the total profit of industrial enterprises above designated size in the first two months was 887.21 billion yuan, a significant decrease of 22.9%year -on -year. Among them, foreign companies, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan business investment enterprises decreased by 35.7%, the largest decline.</p>
<p>In addition, since this year, Deloitte, one of the world's four major accounting firms, has been severely punished in China; the Shanghai office of Bain, the world's three major management consulting companies, has been assaulted by the police; on May 21, China announced the blockade of the Meiguang chip. Order; March, the Beijing police raided and closed the US Survey Corporation Mintzgroup in Beijing.</p>
<p>The "AMCHAMCHINA) recently released the" 2023 Annual Business Survey Report in the United States and Chinese Enterprises in the United States "shows that 49%of member companies believe that they are more" unpopular "in China compared to the previous year. The consumer industry is as high as 56%.</p>
<p>Some are active choice; some are passively suppressed.</p>
<p>"Some people leave, and some people come, such as Musk's Tesla, large -scale investment in the Chinese market. This represents a very different understanding of Western entrepreneurs in the Chinese market." Chen Gong, the founder of Anbang think tank, said to BBC in Chinese.<a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-64734537">China Promoting State -owned Enterprises Disable the "Four" accounting firms or decouples with international investment</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-65501034">Foreign capital faced by foreign investment from Volkswagen to Delois Bein's epidemic in China</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-62698733">Several things you need to know in China and the United States signing audit supervision and cooperation agreement</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science-65854500">Why does the US -China Semiconductor War entering the artificial intelligence AI chip in Deepwater District become the key</a></p>

<p>The picture shows the Tesla factory (information photo) under construction in 2019.</p>
<p>"China's attitude towards different foreign investment is also 'clear love and hate'. The foreign investment that is not waiting is to sum up: the natural monopoly industry, involving security." "In the natural monopoly industries such as oil, telecommunications, banking, electricity, and aviation to build a huge state -owned enterprise group, the others completely withdrew. In these industries, there are very few private enterprises in China, not to mention foreign companies.</p>
<p>And financial security and communication security, and there is a controversy in China and the United States involving audit drafts. The consulting company has been identified by the Chinese side to play the role of commercial spies, so that more and more foreign companies are involved in the increasingly tense confrontation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Tian Yumiao, a professor at the University of West Prudential Liverpool University, told BBC in Chinese that the Chinese government may be the most pragmatic political institution in Chinese history, and "Sun Tzu's Art of War" pays attention to "divide and rule". Therefore, for some American companies and individuals who are positive for China's economic and social development, China will distinguish between companies and individuals who have taken the "sanctions".</p>
<p>"Sino -US economic decoupling is actually a very small event. The Chinese side can choose to decide with, how to decide, and when will it be decoupled." Tian Yumiao said.</p>
<p>There is also a voice in Chinese social media that, for investors, risks are not Sino -US relations, but confidence in Chinese policies and economy. Chinese leaders may solve the confidence of individual enterprises through high standards, but the confidence of overall foreign capital needs more policies in good faith.</p>
<p>Musk's visit to China may just prove this statement. On the first day of his visit, Tesla's stock price rose 5%, and the market value increased by nearly $ 25 billion, making him return to the world's richest man. But at the same time, there was no big improvement in China's A -shares, and the RMB against the US dollar was still falling.</p>

There are no exceptions: the major mainstream media in the United States concentrated the "de -risk" of China's "de -riskization" of China, while the European media are relatively objective, and there are fewer phenomena of one side.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiang's trip to Europe has opened a brand new content of Chinese diplomacy. This is: the "de -risk" wave of China's "de -risk" wave for Western public opinion. It is particularly noteworthy that this authentic name is not a propaganda or diplomatic department that starts in China, but was initiated by politicians such as Chinese Prime Minister. The significance is naturally different.</p>

<p>The new crown traceability problem has been arguing in the United States for a long time, and it is also an important part of affecting the deadlock of Sino -US relations. The Wuhan Virus Research Institute is one of the focus of controversy.</p>
<p><strong> A decryption report in the United States shows that the intelligence circle failed to find direct evidence, which proved that the 2019 coronary virus (COVID-19; Neo-Crown Virus disease) originated from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but at the same time, it cannot be ruled out. </strong></p>
<p>The report from the Office of the National Intelligence Director (ODNI) stated that the American intelligence agencies agreed that the new crown virus was neither genetically modified nor the laboratory domestication. But the possibility of viruses from nature or laboratory still exists.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the report, the Wall Street Journal quoted the Washington Intelligence Circle that the three researchers of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute were the new crown "Zero Patient", and the two of them actively came into contact with the well -known American academic magazine "Science" and denied the relevant statement.</p>
<p>The new crown traceability problem has been arguing in the United States for a long time, and it is also an important part of affecting the deadlock of Sino -US relations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (June 26) states that the United States should "disclose the situation of Detrickburg and the biological laboratory set up around the world, giving the people of the world a responsible explanation."</p>

<p>June 2021: BBC's "News Night" investigated the theory of leakage in the Wuhan Laboratory, interviewed a number of experts, and analyzed the reason.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the intelligence agency, what are the new discoveries</h3>
<p>In March, the US Congress passed the bill to order information about the intelligence agency to decrypt documents about the Wuhan Virus Research Institute within 90 days. The Office of the National Intelligence Director published the decryption document last Friday (23rd).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Report-on-Potential-Links-Between-the-Wuhan-Institute-of-Virology-and-the-Origins-of-COVID-19-20230623.pdf">This 10 -page long report said</a>: "Because two assumptions (natural or laboratory) relied on a large number of assumptions or facing contradictory report challenges, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other agencies still cannot determine the accurate source of COVID-19."</p>
<p>The report pointed out that four U.S. government agencies believe that the virus is infected with humans from animals, and the other two organs -the Energy and FBIs (FBI) -still believe that the virus is leaking the laboratory.</p>
<p>According to the survey report, the US intelligence circle has not been able to exclude the new crown virus comes from the laboratory, but all intelligence agencies agree that the new coronal virus does not originate from the development of biochemical weapons.</p>

<p>However, the report also proposed that scientists at Wuhan Virus Research Institute built different coronary viruses "chimelas" and used the Reverse GeneticCloning technology, which made the hidden intentional modification possible.</p>
<p>According to the report, some researchers may not take sufficient biological safety guarantee measures during the operation experiment before the new crown epidemic.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Lab "Patient No. 0" refers to "fake news"</h3>
<p>However, according to the report, the U.S. Intelligence Institute had unknown laboratory accidents that have occurred in the Wuhan Virus Research Institute.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that the accident occurred in the fall of 2019, and several researchers were infected. However, the report also believes that they are infected with other diseases, and some symptoms do not match the new coronal virus disease.</p>

<p>Shi Zhengli insisted that researchers named "Zero Patient" did not contact the living virus.</p>

Show the news blog "Public" with the purpose of anti -mainstream media [Public)(https://public.substack.com/p/first-people-sickened-by-covid-19), And said that three were researchers for Wuhan Virus Research Institute.</p>
<p>Among them, Dr. Hu Ben is an associate researcher at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute. According to the official website of the Institute, its research direction includes new pathogens of bats and rodents. "The Mass" quotes Dr. BroadInstitute, a post -doctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -Harvard University, and Dr. Dr Alinachan, a molecular biologist. The proud door was regarded as his successor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ridiculous-says-chinese-scientist-accused-being-pandemic-s-patient-zero">Science magazine said that he received a letter from Hu Ben and Yu Ping</a>Essence Hu Ben wrote in the email: "Recently, news about the so -called" Zero Patients "is completely nonsense."</p>
<p>"I didn't get sick in the fall of 2019, and I had no symptoms of new coronary virus. My colleagues and my colleagues received the new coronal virus (SARS-COV-2) antibody detection in March 2020, all of which were negative."</p>
<p>Yu Ping described the allegations as "fake news". "Science" magazine quoted her: "In the fall of 2019, I have no illness nor any new crown symptoms."</p>
<p>The two also denied any living virus experiments.</p>

<p>April 2021: David Nabarro, the WHO New Crown Special Envoy, said that from the past experience, the traceability of the virus rarely finds clear road signs.</p>
<p>Medical journal "Infection, Genetics and Evolution) <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713481830902X?via%3Dihub">Once in February 2019</a>After publishing the study of the same type of viruses of Bat spread and atypical pneumonia (SARS; Sas, Saus), Hu Ben and Yu Ping also participated in the study.</p>
<p>"Science" magazine said that Shi Zhengli confirmed the magazine's statement via email, and said that Hu Ben, Yu Ping and Zhu Yan had only used RNA to extract genetic sorting, and did not contact the living virus.</p>
<p>The magazine also quoted the French National Science Research Center (CNRS) researcher Dr FlorenceDébarre, a researcher at the National Science Research Center (CNRS) who has participated in the virus data of Wuhan South China Seafood wholesale market.</p>
<p>Wuhan South China Seafood wholesale market is the first place where the new crown virus cluster is infected. Supporters of laboratory leaks pointed out that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute is only a 40 -minute drive from the South China wholesale market.</p>
<p>Dr. Dabare said that she had an open attitude towards laboratory leaks. Now she believes that the new crown virus comes from nature and take the initiative to play with the laboratory leaks on the Internet. <a href="https://twitter.com/flodebarre/status/1632422117173067778">Zeng Yujia is one of the targets of Dabre's public counterpart</a> 。</p>

<h3>American politics to send artillery to the Biden government</h3>
<p>John Ratcliffe, who served as the director of the National Intelligence, responded to the latest decryption report during the president of Donald Trump, responded to the latest decryption report, accusing the current president Joebiden and its government "continuously confusing audiovisual".</p>
<p>Ratclyve said in a statement: "Laboratory leakage is the only theory that is supported by science, intelligence and common sense."Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>In the bill of Biden (left) signed a Congress requesting the decryption investigation report in March, he said that his expectations were consistent with Congress, and the more information he could distribute, the better.</p>
<p>The joint investigation conducted by the Chinese government and the UN World Health Organization (WHO) in early 2021 believes that the laboratory leakage theory is "extremely impossible." <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science-56587444">This conclusion caused the WHO to suffer violently</a>Many experts believe that such a conclusion cannot give enough answers, and only more questions are derived.</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Corporation of the United States reported that the Republican House of Republican House Intelligence Committee chairman Miketurner and the President of the Special Group Committee of the New Crown Virus Brad Wenstrup, the President of the New Crown Virus. The decryption report increases the credibility of the laboratory leakage theory.</p>
<p>"The Communist Party of China and the Chinese PLA must be explained solemnly with the Chinese PLA."</p>
<p>"While we are grateful for the report of the Office of the State Intelligence Director, the search and survey of the source of the new crown virus disease must continue."</p>
<p>However, some experts believe that for the new coronal virus disease that leads to nearly 7 million people around the world, its real source may never be known.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The investigations made by Germany in June of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese EU Chamber of Commerce showed that they ended <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体清零令外企叫苦不迭/a-62207086">Zero Policy</a>After that, the hope of China's strong rebound in the economy has been shattered. More than half of the German companies are expected to develop this year's development this year's level last year or even lower than last year.</p>
<p>Although business expectations seem to be dim, more than half of German companies (55%) intend to continue to invest in China in the next few years. However, during the new crown epidemic in 2020 and 2021, more than 70%of German companies who were willing to continue to invest in China. 62%of the companies that insist on investing without considering all issues, saying that this is mainly to maintain its competitiveness in the Chinese market. However, almost one of the four companies expressed their hope to reduce investment, which is significantly higher than the epidemic period.</p>
<p>60%of the interviewed companies expect the market environment to deteriorate, and more than 40%of companies are worried that geopolitical tensions will lead to consequences such as sanctions or export control. For the Ukrainian war and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体德国企业为北京武统未雨绸缪/a-65871883">potential Taiwan conflict</a>The uncertainty brings <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体在华德企气氛低迷/a-51229999">low industry emotions</a>Essence Almost a quarter of companies believe that Beijing's efforts to become more independent of foreign markets, which is also a reason for reducing investment.</p>
<p>One -fifth of companies hope to invest more in countries outside China. And more than 16%of companies have set plans to completely withdraw from China in the worst case.</p>
<h3>negative record of business environment</h3>
<p>A survey made for 570 companies showed that most European companies believe that China has lost its glory as a business place. Yanci, President of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China(Jenskelund)It is said that China's business atmosphere is "the lowest stage we feel."</p>
<p>Although the clearing policy has ended, foreign capital <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济遭重创-在华德企商业信心探底/a-64092035">confidence in China's economic prospects</a>It is fading. At the same time, profits are also declining. In the face of increasing risks and unpredictable environments, 64%of European companies interviewed said that doing business in China became more difficult. This proportion set a record. Limited market access is a major problem encountered in Chinese foreign -funded enterprises. The restrictions set by the government are also another difficulty in complaining of enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition, Chinese domestic companies and foreign companies often lack fair competition. A quarter of European companies complained that forced technology transfer was encountered.</p>
<p>Jeargwuttke, former chairman of the German and EU Chamber of Commerce, confirmed in an interview with the Voice of Germany in BASF's long -term executives, Germany and the EU Chamber of Commerce, which can clearly feel the increasingly fierce nationalist line promoted by Chinese party and state leaders Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>He said, "There are strong nationalism in some areas: we no longer need foreigners, so we will not let them enter the market."</p>
<h3>World Economic Engine Make no longer foreign companies want to evacuate the Chinese market?</h3>
<h3>China Lost its original glory</h3>
<p>Yan Ci, the current president of the Chinese EU Chamber of Commerce, said that no one expected the supervision environment to be improved in the next five years, and the crisis of confidence has not ended.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Voice of Germany, Wudk said that China now emphasizes retreat and self -defense compared with previous open policies. However, there is a fundamental problem that Xi Jinping wants to implement the isolated policy- "China must be independent of the world as much as possible, but at the same time I hope that the world depends on China. Of course, this is not commensurate with globalization."</p>
<p>However, what role can Europeans play in trade and industrial policies?</p>
<p>"Of course, the Chinese will continue to cultivate big companies that bring them technology and employment opportunities. This is the case in the fields of automobiles, chemicals, and mechanical engineering."</p>
<p>He emphasized: "In 2022, EU companies' exports to China were 23%higher than the exports of Switzerland. More than 6.4 million containers were shipped from China to Europe, but only 1.6 million containers were transported back to China from Europe. In many sense, China's dependence on our market is much higher than our dependence on the Chinese market. This is a very depressed thing, because the market is already large enough. "</p>
<p>In recent years, China has been walking forward with hand brakes, which is not just the influence of clearing the zero policy. "There are still many problems with market access restrictions on market access," said Western companies are difficult to operate. "</p>
<h3>Federal MP: "Chinese characters are complicated"</h3>
<h3>渐 gradually rose</h3>
<p>Stanleydruckenmiller, a well -known hedge fund manager and a billionaire investor, has previously known for its firm conviction in China's economic growth. But in early June this year, he scratched China from the list of investment destinations. Drucken Miller believes that following Xi Jinping's political route, China may miss the lofty goal of catching up with the economy and surpassing the world's largest economy and the United States. At the Bloomberg Investment Conference, Druckenmire depicts a dim picture of China's future.</p>
<p>He said: "If (China) does not have high -level power change, the economy will lose vitality." He said that even if there is any obvious improvement in China this year, it is just a sudden and short -term energy explosion, just like you Edible high sugar things are the same. "We expect that sugar has increased and some strong growth in the next 6 to 9 months. But in the long run, I don't think they (Chinese) are the main challenges to the United States in terms of economic strength and growth." Germany Rukemler said.</p>
<p>And Wudick described a more diplomatic description of China's economic policy dilemma. He said that in an economy that strives to overcome serious aging problems, and in the case of major problems in the real estate industry, under the circumstances that local government liabilities and small banks may face the threat of bankruptcy, China may try to restore its previous open opening up Sexual, and then re -execute the idea of "priority to ideology". He said that for European companies, this is not the worst of all options.</p>

<p>Chinese diplomats have recently said the "emergency evacuation plan" formulated by the United States for its citizens in Taiwan that this is exactly the "certificate" that the United States intends to abandon Taiwan once a war occurs.</p>
<p>The Asian Facts Investigation Laboratory (AFCL) interviews found that many countries have formulated a withdrawal of overseas Chinese to respond to various crisis situations. The formulation or update of these plans neither means that the war is about to erupt or interpreted as "the United States intends to abandon Taiwan".</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis</strong></p>
<p>Performed News Institution, headquarters in Florida, USA(The Messenger)In <a href="https://themessenger.com/news/the-u-s-is-preparing-evacuation-plans-for-american-citizens-in-taiwan-exclusive">a report published on June 12</a>Among them, an unnamed US senior intelligence official said that if the war broke out in the Taiwan Strait, the US government would evacuate the American who lived in Taiwan and the Biden government was preparing.</p>
<p>In response to the above reports, John Kirby, a strategic communication coordinator of the National Security Conference, answered the question about the "evacuation plan" at a press conference at the press conference that day, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2023/06/12/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-nsc-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-15/">neither confirmed nor deny its existence</a>However, he pointed out that the evacuation of American citizens from the conflict area is not a routine policy, nor does it show that the current situation in Taiwan is necessary to re -consider this policy.</p>
<p>As for what circumstances, the U.S. government will assist ordinary people with American citizenship, and the US State Department is in a copy <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html">Announcement</a>It is stated that it must be provided with the premise that the commercial transportation is completely interrupted and the conditions permit can be provided by the premise that the public will be provided.</p>
<p>When the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin was asked about related issues at a regular press conference on June 13, although he said he did not understand the relevant situation, he then said, " It is to treat Taiwan as a chess piece and the people of Taiwan as a cannon fodder. To serve the United States' "Taiwan -based China 'strategy, the United States even formulates the" destroying the Taiwan plan'. The essence of Taiwan '. "What does the <strong> emergency evacuation plan mean? </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the war evacuation plan is to evacuate the citizens of a country from the danger, and "no other purpose", the honorary professor of political science at Ohio State University <a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/people/mueller.135">John Mueller</a>(John Mueller) told Asian factual investigation laboratory. "Such an emergency evacuation plan is by no means a sign of the United States that will abandon Taiwan. In fact, it may enable the United States to support Taiwan's armed forces more effectively to resist invasion," the former deputy director of the United States Association [Ge Tianhao] in the Taiwan Association <a href="https://sais.jhu.edu/users/dkeegan2">Ge Tianhao</a> (David J.Keegan)Tell Asia's facts to investigate the laboratory: "This evacuation will enable the US military to support Taiwan to concentrate on defending Taiwan and defeat the PLA without having to take care of American citizens in the conflict and avoid distraction."</p>
<p>"China tries to sow the seeds between Taiwan and the United States to weaken Taiwan, making China more likely to use coercion means forcing Taiwan to accept the rule of mainland China," Ge Tianhao pointed out.</p>
<p>The United States <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/2479">"Taiwan Relations Law"</a>It is suggested that solving cross -strait tensions with peace is critical to the United States. Although the bill did not publicly promise to provide US military support when invasion in China, it left this possibility to the U.S. government to decide on its own.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T18-33-00-04-00/000002.png" />The "Taiwan Relations Law" retains the possibility that the United States can support Taiwan with armed forces when conflict with the outbreak of mainland China.

<p>Senior researcher at Oslo Peace Research Institute <a href="https://www.prio.org/people/11404">Iraria Corolaz</a>(Ilariacarrozza) told Asian facts to investigate the laboratory that such a plan "is a common plan for a country government in a place with foreign relations, especially if the country's political instability or in the central area of political tension."</p>
<p>She said: "It is part of the normal administration for many US citizens living in Taiwan, and it does not necessarily mean that the conflict is about to erupt."</p>

<p>The original article about the so -called emergency plan of "Betlar" clearly mentioned that <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2023/04/18/2003798142">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/04/19/news/national/contingency-plan-in-place-for-filipino-workers-in-taiwan/1887740">the Philippines </a>Japanese <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/09/01/national/japan-taiwan-evacuation-talks/">Japan</a>It has been publicly announced that they have already owned or prepared for the emergency evacuation plan for Taiwanese diaspora, but Wang Wenbin did not mention these countries in the response.</p>
<p>Director of Indo -Pacific Planning of the Marshall Foundation in Germany <a href="https://www.gmfus.org/find-experts/bonnie-s-glaser">Ge Laiyi</a>(Bonnie Glaser)Tell Asia's facts to investigate the laboratory: "The government has the responsibility to protect the safety of overseas citizens. When there is a risk of major natural disasters or conflicts, even if the risk increases slightly, the embassy will formulate or update the evacuation of their employees. Large, the plan to withdraw citizens when necessary will be updated. The update plan is a cautious preparation measure, which does not reflect the decision to withdraw from the citizen. "Ge Tianhao, deputy director of the United States Association in Taiwan, said:" The US State Department and the Ministry of Defense are regularly formulated And updating these evacuation plans does not mean that they want to use these plans immediately or quickly. "</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Asian facts investigation of the laboratory found that Chinese officials claimed that the US emergency evacuation plan aims to damage or destroy Taiwan. This plan does not mean that the war with China is coming, and it has nothing to do with whether the United States has taken military operations when such a conflict broke out.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T18-36-42-04-00/000000.png" />China's 709 incident lawyer group portrait <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/chenguangchengboke/cgc-06262023140809.html/@@images/image">![] [] [](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T18-36-42-04-00/000001.png)</a>Participate in the network</p>
<p>It has been eight years since the "709 Capture" in 2015. You read it right, it is indeed eight years. Because in 2011 before the CCP adopted a large -scale persecution operation in early July 2015, the Chinese government was constantly brewing ... including modifying the law -the abduction of the widely criticized gangsters was written into Article 73 of the Criminal Procedure Law, The black prison is described as "designated surveillance and residence" ... It is carefully prepared for this national persecution of rights protection, rights protection lawyers and awakening citizens.</p>
<p>When all this is almost prepared, when the more important central power transfer is completed for the CCP, and the successful transition, the Chinese government has begun to press and persecutes the people's suppression of the people. In fact, from the "Nandu case" to Jiangxi Xinyu Liu Ping case, then the butcher was arrested, and later changed from administrative detention to criminal detention. This persecution quietly began. To the torture and forced the parties to "self -evidence" on television on TV "709 arrests" and the next "designated surveillance and residence" to the peak.</p>
<p>Originally, friends felt that with the continuous struggle of the "709" wives, the capture of the arrested persons in the persecution of "709" was released one after another. This persecution has passed, but the CCP has recently used the flow of Wang Quanzhang, Li Wenzu, Li Heping, and Li Heping, and Wang Qiaoling and other rights protection lawyers moved out of Beijing ... We must realize that this persecution is not only over, but the CCP is increasingly unscrupulous on the defenders of the persecution of human rights, and there is still an endless momentum.</p>
<p>After Wang Mo was released, he would be repatriated to the country. Recently, he was detained by administrative detention for 10 days because he helped the father and fellow who helped the land in his hometown. Shao Liang was persecuted by the CCP's public security torture; there was also Xi Jinping stepped down to end the Communistic Shandong poet Lu Yang -his real name Zhang Guiqi was sentenced to six years by the Communist Party of China and frozen Lu in order to prevent his children from having money to school. Yang's wife's salary only leaves him 1,200 yuan per month to maintain the most basic life. There are also continuous suppression and persecution of young people in the "white paper movement" after the autumn, and the persecution ... It fully explains that under the communist autocratic tyranny, the law has already become a governance tool for the Chinese government to enslave the people, and it can be modified arbitrarily. In order to maintain his authoritarian regime, the Chinese government has no means to suppress and persecutes the awakened people. As long as you refuse to coincide with the CCP, he will regard you as an enemy.</p>
<p>When the awakened person recognizes: Living in the falling area of the Communist Party of China, as long as you are good at business, then you are born with the enemy of the CCP. No matter what you think of the CCP, it will not affect the CCP as his enemy. And as long as you have come out for the fairness of society, you will be regarded by the CCP as an enemy on the blacklist of the CCP for life and prevention -political trial. This evil originated from the nature of the Communist Party's autocracy, don't expect him to change. Therefore, if the people in the falling area of the Communist Party of China do not want to be slavered by the Communist Party of China, they must fight hard. In addition, there is no wiping ball.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobo said he had no enemy. But does the Chinese government kill him in prison? Intersection Everyone should be considered to be abstained, and it is not possible to have any unrealistic fantasies about the Chinese government.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T19-19-00-04-00/000000.png" />Campbell, a coordinator of the National Security Council, once again emphasized the importance of US -China communication at a seminar held by the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center on Monday. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-06262023111551.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T19-19-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Video Screenshot/CSIS official website(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-06262023111551.html/@@stream)Since its visit to China, US Secretary of State Brillin has not yet established a direct military dialogue mechanism between the United States and China. On Monday, Kurtcampbell, a coordinator of the National Security Council, once again emphasized the importance of US -China communication in maintaining regional security.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/wy-06202023102946.html"><strong> Bollingin visited China to reveal the fundamental differences between the US -China processing bilateral relations </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/kw-06192023132239.html">Blintin ended his visit to Huamei and China Agreement "Stable Relationship"</a></strong></p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Brills ended a two -day trip last week and held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Director of the CPC Central Committee Foreign Affairs Office, and Qin Gang of Foreign Minister Qin Gang. Blingken emphasized at a press conference before Beijing that the United States and China had reached a consensus that it would maintain hotline communication between high -levels to ensure that the competition between the two countries would not evolve into a conflict.</p>
<p>The outside world noticed that although Brinken said that the two sides had reached a close communication consensus, in the face of the friction between the two military military and the increasingly rising friction in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, the Minister of Defense of the United States and China has not yet held a substantial meeting.</p>
<p>The National Security Council ’s Indo -Pacific Affairs coordinator Campbell's seminar at the Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Research Center (CENTER for Strategic and Internationalstudies) stated:“ China is unwilling to establish a mechanism to avoid military risks, and do not want to conduct military dialogue This is what happens for years, not just now. We believe that it is very important to establish practical communication channels in the United States and China. We will continue to explain the importance of establishing a dialogue mechanism to China, especially in the near future. Fang's army has more close friction. "</p>
<p><strong> Li Shangfu's sanction in the United States is unwilling to start a dialogue </strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had invited Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu to hold bilateral talks during the Shangri-Ladialogue, but did not receive a Chinese reply. It is generally believed that because Li Shangfu was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 to assist the Chinese military to import Russian weapons in 2018, China rejected the rejection of the Defense Minister's dialogue.</p>
<p>At the Seminar of Monday, some participants asked Campbell if the United States should cancel sanctions against Li Shangfu in exchange for greater dialogue space? However, Campbell did not respond positively.</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: Chinese threats contribute to the AUKUS Alliance </strong></p>
<p>At the seminar, the participating scholars also focused on issues such as the "Aukus" alliance composed of the United States, Britain and Australia, as well as issues such as peace and stability in the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p>CharleSedel, director of the Australian project of Strategy and International Research, clearly stated that the purpose of the "three -sided security partnership" of the United States, Britain, and Australia is a threat to fight against China's gradually expanding in the Indo -Pacific region.</p>
<p>Edier said: "'Three -sided security partnerships' hopes to cope with the security environment that is gradually degraded in the Indo -Pacific region, especially for the expansion of the explosiveness of Chinese military forces, and the increasingly aggressive military behavior of China. These two trends The countries of the Indo -Pacific region are becoming more concerned about security and the formation of the "three -sided security partnership" to formulate a common strategy to respond to the challenges brought by the Beijing authorities. "</p>
<p>Edel emphasized that the purpose of the "three -sided security partnership" is based on the aggressive behavior of deceiving Beijing's expansion outward, not intentionally provoking China: the purpose of "'Three -sided Security Partnership" is not stimulating China. I quoted worship to worship What President Deng had said in San Diery: There is only one most important goal on the three -sided security partnership, strengthening the security of the Indo -Pacific region to cope with the turbulence of the current situation.

<p>Campbell also stated at the meeting that the United States has established a variety of alliance structures with allies in the Indo -Pacific region in recent years to maintain its existing international order: "The United States and the United States all show their determination, not only to maintain the security of the Indo -Pacific region Stable, it is also necessary to protect the current system of the Indo -Pacific region. The current system has made the economy in the Indo -Pacific region achieve amazing growth and helps the public from poverty. This system is worthy of being guarded. Shang also benefit China. "</p>
<p>Campbell also pointed out that China ’s ambition to the world is clear, which has also prompted American allies to have the courage to speak clearly when fighting against China in recent years. (G7) We can see that the heads of state of all countries have condemned the challenges brought by China before.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-26T19-23-00-04-00/000000.png" />Xu Ming, a member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the former National Grain Administration.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-06262023094034.html/@@stream)The inside story of Bo Xilai's secret Xu Ming returned to Chongqing's "use of influence" was that he received money but did not do anything. After he took the initiative to surrender, he took the initiative to surrender. The great future of Wang Fu also settled in.</p>
<p>In our previous article, the former member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Bo Xilai collapsed for more than nine years, and his secret Xu Ming was in June 2021 after his retirement years. Can return to Chongqing "using the convenient and status of the former member of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Secretary -General, etc., and promise to help others in case of case handling through the posts of staff of other countries, illegally receiving RMB 1.2 million" Essence</p>
<p>As soon as the news came out that year, the entire party was uproar, causing Chen Minda, then the then Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, who was "entering" at the time of the 20th National Congress.</p>
<p>We might as well trace the time back: On July 13, 2021, the website of the State Administration of Discipline Inspection of the Central Committee issued an announcement: "Xu Ming, a member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the National Grain Administration, accepted the review and investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection." In the announcement, there was only Xu Ming's resume, and the reason for the investigation was only one sentence "suspected serious violation of discipline and law."</p>
<p>Calculated, Xu Ming has retired for 3 years and 4 months at this time. 7 months later, on January 25, 2022, the CCP official media announced that Xu Ming seriously violated the party's political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline and life discipline, constituted serious duties of violations, suspected bribes, and used influence to accept bribery. After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, do not converge or stop, the nature is serious, and the impact is bad. After studying and reporting to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for approval by the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Xu Ming was expelled from the party; Disciplinary and illegal income; transfer it to the procuratorial organs for prosecutors for review and prosecution in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Please note that Xu Ming's bribery has been divided into two items here, namely the crime of bribery and using influence to accept bribery. In the previous article of our three columns, we have introduced Article 388 of the Criminal Law of the Communist Party of China in Article 388 of the Criminal Law of the Communist Party of China. Now to explain another perspective, the so -called "crime of using influence to accept bribery" must be those who do not have the status of state staff or have no state staff when they are no longer a state staff.</p>
<p>Specific to Xu Ming, during his life, he used a specific position when he was in his place of reign and accepted bribery. After leaving the office, he used the "Yu Wei" who had taken a certain position as "Yu Wei" to accept bribes, and was convicted as "using influence to accept bribes."</p>
<p>So, the next question is that Xu Ming returned to Chongqing's "use influence" one month before his announcement of the investigation, and who was the "others" who bribed 1.2 million? Who is Xu Ming's "other country staff" who "promised to pass" to the bribery at the time?</p>
<p>In the past two years from Xu Ming's announcement to the investigation of his first trial, there are two people involved in the case of the Xu Ming case he have heard in Chongqing. One is Chen Jun, the former party committee secretary and chief of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau Traffic Patrol Corps.</p>
<p>However, after the author's verification, although Tan Xiaorong had also had a lot of intersections with Xu Ming, who had been with people in Chongqing at that time, this person had taken the initiative to "surrender" to the Chongqing Discipline Inspection Commission as early as January 2021. Flete party membership, expel public office, and transfer to justice. After that, it is unlikely that bribes will be given the idea of reducing the blame for yourself.</p>
<p>And the author has heard about Chen Jun's relatives asking Xu Ming, hoping that Xu Ming can achieve the story that allows Chen Jun to get from the lightness through "influence", maybe closer to the facts.</p>
<p>Let's introduce the relationship between Chen Jun and Xu Ming.</p>
<p>On May 29, 2021, the Chongqing Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection issued a news: Chen Jun, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Communications Patrol Corps of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau and the head of the Captain Captain, is suspected of serious disciplinary violations and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervision investigation by the Chongqing Discipline Inspection Commission.</p>
<p>The notice added this Chen Jun's resume, which was roughly born in June 1968, and locals in Chongqing. Born in Chongqing Police School in Sichuan Province. From the police, he entered the then traffic police department of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province at that time. From police officers to April 2010, he was appointed as the promotion time between the executive deputy chief chief chief of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau Traffic Patrol Police Corps (Zheng County level). In 24 years, the promotion speed cannot be considered fast.</p>
<p>At that time, as soon as the news of Chen Jun was investigated, the external media immediately revealed that Bo Xilai and Wang Lijun set up an old account or scandal of a women's traffic police special service team in Chongqing. The reason why the word "scandal" was described was because the actual purpose of Bo Xilai and Wang Lijun for the so -called women's special service team with their appearance as the first move were formed.</p>
<p>In September 2012, our Liberty Asia also quoted the report from the local insiders in Chongqing: Chengdu Prosecutor's Office of the Chengdu Procuratorate was guilty of leakage of Wang Lijun's allegations, such as his rape. After Wang Lijun went to Chongqing to serve as the director of the Public Security, he once reformed the image of the police force and established a women's traffic patrol police platform. Among them, 13 graduate female police officers, Wang Lijun raped 8 ...</p>
<p>Thinking back to that year, many of the new politics contents of the new policy of "high affirmation" of the new policy of "high affirmation" in Chongqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo and Secretary of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Political Bureau in Chongqing. When Bo Xilai was in Dalian's administration, she used a beautiful female policeman to be the "city business card".</p>
<p>This women's special service team in Chongqing officially appeared in June 2010, and Chen Jun was promoted to the Captain Captain of the Communications Patrol Corps of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau by the Chongqing Public Security Bureau's Yuguzhong District Branch of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau in April 2010. Therefore, as soon as the external media saw that Chen Jun was investigated, he immediately associated him with the formation of the women's special service team. The women's traffic police team fell into the titles such as Wang Lijun was accused of sex pervert. "</p>
<p>The story I heard is that after the establishment of the women's special service team, Chen Jun was transferred to the Jiangbei District of Chongqing as the Political Commissar of the Public Security Branch. One of the goals is to make it clear as the deputy hall level. The second goal is to warm up for the future transfer traffic police system. At that time, Xu Ming, who was a member of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, Secretary -General and Secretary of the Party Working Committee of the Organ, was the key one on Chen Jun's career. "" ".</p>
<p>After Bo Xilai collapsed due to the betrayal of Wang Lijun, Chen Jun's position did not rise. In April 2013, he still returned to the Municipal Public Security Bureau Traffic Patrol Corps to serve as the party committee secretary and chief captain in April 2013. He is determined as a bureau -level at the department a year later.However, during this period, Chen Junli wanted to smoke, and was no longer satisfied with the past, such as helping people to handle violations, to do a special card, etc.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that Chen Jun at that time was far from great greed in the CCP police system, and his actual wealth was not amazing. And his next way to get rich is actually borrowing huge amounts of funds from his relationship households first, agreed to be low interest or even not interesting (friend help), and then turned to this money to lend this money to another relationship household. How long this behavior lasted, the reporter was unclear, but he knew that the cause of Chen Jun's dismissal was that a merchant who had borrowed usury from Chen Jun went bankrupt because of the new crown epidemic. Then he was forced by Chen Jun's debt, and was afraid that Chen Jun would "make it secretly" with his police uniform, so he simply started the real name of the Chongqing and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and attached him and Chen Jun. The two -person borrowing contract.</p>
<p>After Chen Jun was suddenly announced by the Chongqing Discipline Inspection Commission and the Supervisory Commission, the family members were not allowed to say in the Chongqing Municipal Political and Legal Committee and the Public Security Bureau, so they asked Xu Ming, who had nothing to do in Beijing, and Xu Ming laughed. After the "first period" of RMB 1.2 million, he personally rushed to Chongqing, who had been away for many years.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this Wang Fu was not the lower level of Xu Ming and Bo Xilai in Chongqing. However, Wang Fu and Xu Ming had interspersed in the State Council system in the last century. Because Wang Fu, who entered the official after he was admitted to the Beijing People's Congress from his hometown of Shanxi, had a desire to return to his hometown Guangzong Yaozu at the time, so he took the initiative to ask for a return back. In Shanxi, he served as the Deputy Director of the Shanxi Provincial Sports Reform Commission. Then, he turned around in several deputy deputy deputy deputy departments and bureaus in Shanxi Province, and he was always promoted to hopeless, so he asked Xu Ming, a "popular fried chicken" under Bo Xilai.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that whether Bo Xilai or his father Bo Yibo. Although neither he was in Shanxi, their father and son had an influence on their own politics in Shanxi. Three points. Therefore, Bo Xilai did not need to come out at all. On behalf of Bo Xilai, Xu Ming gave a condolences to the then deputy secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Xue Yanzhong. Wang Fu was immediately announced that he enjoyed the main office of the department at the deputy position ... From then on, he entered the fast lane. In 2016, the official to the deputy governor of Shanxi Province.</p>
<p>After Bo Xilai had an accident, after Xu Ming was transferred away from Chongqing, the Secretary -General of the Chongqing Municipal Committee had changed several letters. In January 2018, it was replaced by Wang Fu transferred from Shanxi.</p>
<p>Before that, Wang Fu, who had just been the Vice Governor of Shanxi Province for half a year, was announced to be renamed a more important member of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Secretary -General of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. He was transferred to the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Secretary -General. And Chongqing is of course more important than Shanxi Province. Such frequent changes in duties have been strongly cultivated.</p>
<p>After three years at the position of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Secretary -General, Wang Fu was announced to be renamed as a member of the Standing Committee and Deputy Mayor of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee. He replaced Wu Cunrong, who was renewed as a full -time deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee.</p>
<p>Considering the qualifications of the economic specialty and the financial system of the State Council and the economic system of the local government's economic system for his reasons, this arrangement at that time obviously meant that Wang Fu was already a trained object of the administrative leader of Chongqing or other provinces.</p>
<p>However, as of the end of the year, the promotion of his Wang Fu was suddenly suspended.</p>
<p>In December 2021, Tang Liangzhi, deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, mayor of the municipal government, and party secretary of the party group, was suddenly announced by Wang Fu who replaced him.</p>
<p>One month later, Tang Liangzhi was announced to be renamed the chairman of the CPPCC of Anhui Province. Wang Fu's name suddenly appeared on the list of the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee and became the new disciplinary committee secretary of the province.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why Wang Fu lost a good future is because Xu Ming asked him to help him fight for a case from the light of Chen Jun's case and was rejected by Wang Fu. When the Central Discipline Inspection Commission talked, he took the initiative to give himself a "use of influence" in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Speaking of Wang Fu, Xu Ming rejected Xu Ming's fault, but he did not expect Xu Ming's "surrender" behavior at the time to make him Wang Fu's mistakes. The minister believes that it should not be reused.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the Xu Ming case opened the first trial. The content of the indictment announced on the same day understood that he used the convenience and status of his original committee and secretary general of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee after leaving. Behavior provides help with others in case handling, and illegally collects RMB 1.2 million.</p>
<p>The "staff of other countries" mentioned here should refer to Fu. The case occurred in June 2021. Xu Ming was announced a month later.</p>
<p>The next judgment emphasized that the defendant Xu Ming's behavior constituted the crime of bribery and the use of influence and bribery. The amount of bribery was particularly huge, and the amount of bribery was huge with influence. In view of the attempted attempted departments of Xu Ming's bribery, the use of influence and bribery is surrendered. After the case, the fact that most of the facts that the supervisory organs have not yet mastered the facts of bribery, confession and regrets, and actively retreat. The crime of bribery that he has committed can be punished lightly, and the crime of bribery it he committed can be reduced.</p>
<p>The "surrender to the use of influence by influence" also confirmed from the side that the reporter revealed to the author is very authentic.</p>
<p>In addition, the reporter also said that one of the charges listed by Xu Ming's notification of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection "moral corruption" is derived from the revealing of his ex -wife. The reason why I rushed out. As for whether Xu Ming's "delusional central government" is also revealed by his ex -wife, it is unknown.</p>
<p>However, Xu Ming, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for "from light punishment", said that he should not live in prison for a long time, because the CCP official media had previously reported that he would win from retirement to win the property lawsuit between the real estate lawsuit with his ex -wife after retirement. During that time, several diseases such as cerebral thrombosis had been suffered, so there is a high probability that it will be medical treatment.</p>
<p>As for the unlucky Wang Fu, although Xu Ming's explanation materials proved that Wang Fu did not give gifts when he asked him for help, so he did not spend money to buy officials, but because he did not report Xu Ming's request in time, he seized the provincial level. The great future of administrative leaders.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

<p>History is really unpredictable, but it is also attractive. On the morning of June 24, Eastern Time, global public opinion thought that he could witness the occurrence of a historical drama with an unusual excitement, but by the afternoon, it quickly reversed. I refer to the mutiny of the Russian mercenary Wagner Group. The torrent of Wagner's soldiers rolled into Moscow. When global public opinion held his breath and opened his eyes widely, when the Putin regime was in danger, he did not expect the afternoon peak circuit to turn the troops and return to the camp in Ukraine. A big scene stopped as soon as it was staged.</p>
<p>In a conversation program on the morning of June 24th, I believed that Pryigo's altitude was likely to end with failure. The reason was that in Putin's national television speech, it was announced to announce the "justice parade" defined by Perigo. After the "armed rebellion", the Russian Parliament, the head of Orthodox Church, government officials, and public opinion quickly expressed support for Putin. Putin also called with Belarus President Lukashenko, Turkish President Erdogan and several Central Asian countries. The other party said that this is Russia's internal affairs, understanding and supporting Putin's decision. Although the banner played by Pryo is corrupted by the Moscow's military leadership, he wants to "Qing Jun's side". Failure in this war. This will make many Russian people unable to accept the mutiny of Wagner's mercenaries. Although they also hate the corruption of Putin regime, they must take care of this so -called overall situation in this country. After all, Putin is the leader they chose and a symbol of national unity. It can be said that Putin has indeed succeeded in brainwashing the Russian nation over the years. Because of this, some soldiers and officers of the Wagner Group will face great psychological pressure.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared to Moscow's empty defense, although Wagner seems to have the advantages of people and heavy weapons and equipment, and does not shot a shot, it has occupied the headquarters of the southern Russian military region. Fighting, unless Putin completely lost its authority, his order was rejected by the officers, and he could mobilize troops such as Russia and Far East to support.</p>
<p>However, things have reversed much faster than my judgment, and it is unexpected by most people from the outside world. It is also like almost everyone -I think it is also included in Putin -not expected to launch a mutiny Essence The rapid solution of the matter now seems to be due to the mediation of the Belarusian President Lukashenko. The latter has a 20 -year private relationship with Pleigo. With Putin's authorization, he has negotiated with Prita. It is unfavorable, especially with the true intention of his launch of the mutiny -to prevent the Wagner Group from being compiled and loses the control of the army. Although the Wagner soldiers who participated in the "rebellion" were not held accountable because they paid on the battlefield, soldiers who did not participate in the "rebellion" would be compiled by the Russian Ministry of Defense. Perigon was also canceled criminal charges. However, the price was "exile". Belarus, leaving his troops that he created and rely on. The general relieved the armor and returned to the field, and one of the bars was no longer scary. In addition, Pricig is "exiled" Belarus, although he has a good relationship with Putin -in a sense, Wagner Group is also a white glove of Putin, but this time the criminals are chaotic. Such rebellion has always been guilty of death. Kashenko guarantees, but if he is not honest in Belarus, he wants to come back to Dongshan, who can guarantee that Putin, who is born in a agent, won't kill him? And he asked to replace the Russian Minister of Defense, Hiyu, and other high officials. According to the Kremlin Palace, this is not a topic that he and Lukashenko have the right to discuss. From this point of view, the price paid by Perigon in this mutiny is actually heavy. It is never that as the agreement says, it has guaranteed the interests of the Wagner Group to the greatest extent. And why Perigon is willing to accept this result, it is the weirdness of the incident.</p>
<p>I think that the key reason is likely that the strong Russian nationalism on Perigo has allowed him to agree to withdraw. The leader of the Wagner's mercenaries and the former chef of Putin may be more thoughtful than Putin himself. The worst battle of the Russian battlefield was his mercenaries. The reason why Putin put his troops in those defense areas, perhaps the strong Russianism on his body. It is said that the mercenaries of the Wagner Group are mainly composed of active duty and veterans, as well as prisoners. They are different from the mercenaries that generally fight for money. Fight on the battlefield. This says a certain reason. The strong nationalism of Porigan made him persuaded in Lukashenko that he felt that he could not have a civil war in Moscow. Otherwise, he overturned Putin, but it failed to Russia in the Russian battlefield, and he became a national sinner. Therefore, he said in the retreat command that it is the highest principle to prevent Russia from bleeding. After occupying the headquarters of the southern Military Region of Russia, Wagner did not close the airport and the missile launch tower in order to continue launching missiles to Ukraine. He also said that it solved the problem of Moscow and went back to Holland. This was from one side. It confirms his nationalism.</p>
<p>Is there any anti -thief in history? Song Jiang in the Song Dynasty may be regarded as one. However, the nationalism who is unwilling to see the blood -conflicting conflict can only explain that Pryigon agrees with the withdrawal, and he cannot explain that he "voluntarily" leave Wagner to Belarus, because there will be a danger of life in the future, unless a miracle occurs, He has no capital to play with the Moscow's military leadership he hated, let alone the same as Putin; that is, his political career is actually over at this moment, which should not be the result he wants. So the reasonable preservation is what he has to pinch it on Putin's hands. Some American intelligence officials stated that Pleigo's close relatives were controlled by Putin, which made him have to be soft. This possibility does not rule out. On the same day, I also saw that during Wagner's mercenaries on the way to Moscow, Russian security agencies were searching for the headquarters building of Vagna Group in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other factors, such as the old feelings of the master, and do not want to completely turn their faces with Putin. Poligon's "rebellion" did not point his finger at Putin from beginning to end. In the 5 -minute TV speech on the "armed rebellion", Putin did not directly order the name of Pritigon, and left each other a back space for each other. For another example, Pricigen officially launched a mutiny, especially after Putin's speech, he found that his rebellion did not get the response and support of Russia's mainstream people and political forces. The forces of all parties will definitely be crushed, and the end will be much worse than now.Although Pryigon has ended a "exile" end of Belarus, however, this mutiny also made the Russian people see that Putin had helpless when he challenged Putin's power, and had to ask Lukashenko to come forward to solve the authority of the problem. The decline scene. In addition, the mutiny also questioned the legitimacy of the war again, and the morale of the morale of the war soldiers in front of Russia cannot be underestimated. These are all about Putin to face and resolve. From this perspective, this matter has not ended, how to evolve in the future is still worthy of attention.</p>

<p>On May 15, 2023, the first column article of the first column of the "Monetary Policy Implementation Report" of the Central Bank in 2023 discussed "reasonable grasp of interest rate levels". So, what is China's reasonable interest rate? How to grasp it reasonably? On June 8th, the six major banks simultaneously lowered the deposit interest rate to increase the increase (still higher than the 1 -year regular deposit interest rate of 1.5%higher than the 1 -year -old deposit on October 24, 2015). On June 12, 11 joint -stock banks reduced deposit interest rates (the Industrial Bank was not adjusted). On the 13th, the short -term policy interest rate of the central bank decreased from 2%to 1.9%from 2%to 1.9%. Points to 3.25%. On the 15th, the central bank's interim policy interest rate MLF interest rate dropped from 2.75%to 2.65%. On the 16th, the market benchmark interest rate DR007 fell to 1.9416%. On the 20th, the 1 -year LPR was 3.65%, and the LPR of more than 5 years was 4.3%, each downgrading 10 basis points. The dense interest rate order decline operation reflects what logic of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy operation?</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>The interest rate of commercial bank deposits increases the decline in the boot rate system?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first quarter of 2023, the central bank's monetary policy enforcement report took DR007 and 7 -day reverse repurchase interest rates as policy interest rates, comparable to the target interest rate of US federal funds. In the currency market, the central bank through policy interest rates, that is, the 7 -day reverse repurchase daily reverse repurchase affects the market benchmark interest rate DR007, which affects the currency market. In the credit market, the central bank affects LPR through the monthly central bank policy interest rate MLF operation. In the capital market, the central bank affects national bond yields through 7 days of reverse repurchase and MLF.</p>
<p>But what is the relationship between policy interest rates and commercial bank deposits? On October 24, 2015, the central bank determined that the benchmark interest rate of one -year deposit was 1.5%. In June 2021, the People's Bank of China guided interest rate self -discipline mechanism to optimize the upper limit of the self -discipline of deposit interest rate self -discipline. It was formed by a certain multiplier by the benchmark interest rate of deposit, and it was determined to add a certain base point. In September 2021, President Yi Gang wrote that "deposit interest rates are generally more stable than other market interest rates. At present, the benchmark interest rate of one -year deposit deposit in my country is 1.5%. Based on this, it can be floated or floated. "Golden level" meets the needs of cross -cyclical design. " At present, the interest rate of the 5 major banks and 11 joint -stock banks has not broken through the benchmark interest rate of the central bank's one -year deposit of 1.5%.</p>
<p>However, in April 2022, the central bank established a market -oriented adjustment mechanism for deposit interest rates, urging banks to refer to the interest rate of bond market represented by 10 -year Treasury bond yields and loan market interest rates represented by one -year LPR, and reasonably adjusted the level of deposit interest rates ( That is, the deposit interest rate is based on the two market benchmark interest rates); in September, the central bank's style changed greatly, and the deposit interest rate formation mechanism changed again. Other banks follow up. This round of interest rate reduction operations is the implementation of the central bank's policy in September, that is, on the basis of the unchanged benchmark interest rate of the one -year deposit, commercial banks cut interest rates first, and the central bank's benchmark interest rate is adjusted again?</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>Why is the structural management of interest rate period since 2020 regulated by the level of deposit interest rates since 2022?</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the Bank of China has changed from a one -year loan interest rate to LPR, the central bank has coincided with the new crown epidemic. The central bank knows that there is a transformation process. Since 2020, the central bank has begun to unblock monetary policy transmission after establishing LPR's benchmark interest rate standards. "Since 2020, the People's Bank of China has used reform methods to unblock monetary policy transmission, continue to promote the reform of the loan market quotation interest rate (LPR), and the cost of corporate financing has declined significantly." "Since 2021, the People's Bank of China has used reform methods to unblock monetary policy transmission, continuously release the reform dividend of the loan market quotation interest rate (LPR), and promote the steady and decreased comprehensive financing costs of enterprises."</p>
<p>In 2022, the central bank indirectly reduced the level of loan interest rates from the perspective of reducing the level of deposit interest rates. In the first quarter, the "continuous release of the loan market quotation interest rate (LPR) reform dividends, optimized the supervision of deposit interest rates, and promoted the actual loan interest rate to further reduce." Since the second quarter of 2022, "Since the beginning of this year, the market -oriented reform of interest rates has been continued, the loan market quotation interest rate (LPR) reform dividends are continued, the deposit interest rate supervision is optimized, and the actual loan interest rate has been further reduced." In the first quarter of 2023 Protection interest rate (LPR) reform efficiency and market -oriented adjustment mechanism for deposit interest rates ". The transformation of the central bank's policy reflects the adjustment of the central bank's interest space to stabilize financial institutions from compressed financial institutions, and pay more attention to financial stability (mainly banks stable) and reduce liability costs (while reducing liability costs does not seem to be the original intention of commercial banks, but instead The result of "central bank guidance").</p>
<p><strong> Third, the "central bank guidance" of the central bank's interest rate policy is different from the logic behind the long -term guidance of interest rates? </strong></p>
<p>Economic theory believes that the central bank has a small fine -tuning interest rate level and the opportunity cost is small. Therefore, supplemented by communication or long -term guidance can play a large policy effect. In the first quarter of 2023, the central bank's monetary policy enforcement report first proposed the "improvement of market interest rate+central bank guidance → LPR → loan interest rate" conduction mechanism ". The "central bank guidance" is obviously different from "long -term guidance". Western central banks have just given up interest rate long -term guidance interest rate management methods. They believe that once they are facing uncertainty, the central bank should give up long -term guidance, but should adopt MBM. According to the changes in the situation of each meeting interval, the interest rate Interest rate adjustment path. Therefore, it can be judged that the central bank of China believes that economic uncertainty is small (obvious economic trends), and the central bank has a certain "central bank guidance" information advantage. And the object of "central bank guidance" is obviously commercial banks rather than "market". Due to the poor ability of "guiding" non -"long -term guidance" management expectations, the effect of cutting interest rate cuts will also be less, and it may be more accumulated by relying on low interest rates.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why can't currency loose reduce interest rates?****</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the current rules of interest rate policy?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The economics community generally believes that the basic rules of interest rate policy adjustment are Taylor rules, that is, central banks adjust policy interest rate response output gaps and inflation gaps. At present, the economic growth rate in the first quarter of 2023 was 4.5%lower than market expectations and potential economic growth rates, and CPI 1.3%in the first quarter was also lower than 3%of the annual target value. It seems that the real data central bank based on the first quarter is necessary to further cut interest rates. However, due to the cumulative effect of monetary policy conduction and the cumulative effect of loose policies, considering the gradual progress of economic recovery, the current policy interest rate level of the central bank seems to be consistent with international institutions (April IMF predicts China's 2023 GDP growth rate of 5.2%, 6 In the month, OECD predicted China's economic growth rate of 5.4%in 2023, CPI2.1%, and the World Bank predicted GDP growth rate of 5.6%). That is, inflation is expected to be lower than the goal, and economic growth is expected to be in the target range. At this time, how does the central bank make decisions? The first is to look at the central bank's weight choice, that is, even more disgusting inflation or more disgusting economic imbalance. The second is to look at the central bank's concerns about the excessive currency of the number of days? That is, once the interest rate decreases too much, the super -issuing currency "getting out" from the deposit of the banking system may also be unbearable by the Chinese economy. Therefore, the author agrees with the central bank's point of view, that is, the level of stable deposit interest rates is the "stabilization of economic stability" in China and the "social stability" of vulnerable groups.</p>

Fox News reached a reconciliation case with Dominion Votingsystems (Dominion Votingsystems) before $ 787.5 million, and then parted ways with the star anchor Karson, a good star anchor at the end of April.</p>

<p>44 -year -old Wats joined Fos News as a production assistant after graduating from university in 2001. He soon started the interview style of "Ambush Journalism".</p>
<p>Watts is known for its unknown interview objects on the street. These people are usually politicians, government officials, or liberal activists, and many of them are angry with Wats's approach.</p>
<p>He has been accused of broadcasting racist programs, ridiculing tourism as "Lu Snake in Life", and ridicule immigration. During the epidemic at the end of 2021, Wats urged the participants of a conservative political conference to "raid" Anthonyfauci, the top American infectious disease expert. Foqi was the Dean of the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the spokesperson for the United States to fight COVID -19. Wats called on the participants to bombard the Buddha and "give a fatal blow." Foqi later said that Wats should be "fired on the spot", but Foss News defended their star reporters in the statement. Fox News said today that the new personnel lineup will "ensure that our audience can get unparalleled reports of first -class teams in the next few years."</p>

<p>This is not the first time in Sri Lanka to try to fight plastic issues. Jiaxinch admits that it has its own difficulty. For example, in 2006, the ban on ultra -thin plastic bags and plastic wraps was blatantly contempt for manufacturers.</p>
<p>He said, "Of course, we sometimes have a raid inspection, but the raid cannot solve the problem."</p>
<p>"We must have environmentally friendly literacy to make the production line a better and more environmentally friendly production method."</p>
<p>In 2017, a garbage mountain in Kloren, the capital of Sri Lanka, collapsed, causing more than 30 people to die, and hundreds of people were damaged. The garbage dump was later closed.</p>
<p>Soon after, Sri Lanka disabled plastic shopping bags, but this provision was not strictly implemented.</p>
<p>The United Nations said that plastic products used in Sri Lanka were only 3%recovered, and less than half of the global average of 7.2%.</p>
<p>The 2020 study of the CENTRE For ENVIRONMENTASTICE research showed that disposable plastic products such as plastic bags, plastic wraps, straws, etc., accounting for nearly 1.5 % of urban waste.</p>
<p>This 22 million people in South Asian countries manufacture more than 1.5 million metric tons of plastic waste each year, half of which flow to the canal and river, and finally flow into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Environmentalists said that cleaning plastic and stopping manufacturing more plastic is also good for health.</p>
<p>According to the National Dengue Control Unit, places where plastic containers are discarded, dengue fever will also increase, and dengue heat diffusion and plastic waste will be greatly related.</p>
<p>Regardless of the goal is to improve health or reduce pollution, anti -plastic environmental protection persons said that continuous implementation is still the key.</p>
<p>The founder of the Environmental Organization Zeroplastic Movement Nishshaanka Desilva said: "This move is good, but I am worried that they can really take action and implement it."</p>

South Korea was originally in Group A, but was reduced to Japan with a lower trust B Group in 2019. Group A, the highest degree of trust, is also known as a white list of countries, and it applies to the most favorable trade measures.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese government has confirmed that South Korea has the same export management level as Japan, it is expected to be announced on June 30 by the government order specified as a white list of the white list of the white list, and it is officially implemented on July 21.</p>
<p>With South Korea's return to the white list, it may be transferred to the tool machines that may be transferred to military use and are strictly controlled. There is almost no need to apply for individual export permits.</p>

<p>Vladimir(Vladimir Putin)It seems to overcome the biggest domestic crisis since the beginning of his administration. But the Russian president's domestic and foreign allies did not scramble to congratulate him. The emotions of the elite and the tone of the official propaganda are far from the joy after victory. After 23 years of rule, and the second year of the Ukrainian war (this war should have brought glory to Putin and his regime), a coup may occur, which itself has a question mark on his ability to control Russia. This incident also challenged the statement about most people in Putin's patriotism.</p>

The company's preliminary prospectus of IPOs in Hong Kong revealed that it is rapidly exhausted limited cash reserves. This company, which is closely related to domestic retail giants, is estimated that its current financial resources are enough to provide funds for the operation of the next 12 months.</p>
<p>This makes the completion of the IPO more and more important, because according to the latest prospectus submitted last Thursday, listing may significantly increase the company's cash reserves. As of the end of March, its cash reserves were only 477 million yuan. There is only one problem, that is, the multi -point wisdom's business progress is not fast. In the six months since the first submitted to the prospectus in December last year, the business development speed has slowed sharply.</p>

<h3>"Kong Yiji's gown": China's employment situation is becoming more and more severe, and young people find the way from the "blue -collar" work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chang Siying * BBC Chinese</li>
</ul>
<p>1:46 am on June 27, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T01-46-34.000Z/_130200845_img_8170.jpg"></a><strong> 26 -year -old Zhang Jingjing grew up in rural Chongqing, China. He studied hard in the cold window of changing his destiny in reading and admitted to college and became the pride of the villagers. However, after graduating from college in 2019, she found that not only did she not get a skill, but even the expected salary was not even in the economic downturn. </strong></p>
<p>Her university is majoring in marketing. After graduation, she has entered the real estate industry for sales. This is one of the industries that have faced the most pressure on transformation in recent years. After three years of ups and downs employment experience, she was exhausted. Occasionally, she came into contact with the housekeeping industry and saw some hope.</p>
<p>"At that time, I was already with a quite collapse and 'rotten'. I felt that it would be enough to find a job to support myself." Zhang Jingjing said. But she found that she loved this line.</p>
<p>Her job is to give her family nanny and family teachers at the age of 5 years old. Most of the time, she played with the child, and she has time to help the elderly at home to do housework. Take off the suit and put on the casual clothes, she became a "blue -collar" worker.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the unemployment rate of young people in China has been at a high level for several years. According to the latest data released by the official June, the unemployment rate of young people aged 16 to 24 reached a record high since 2018, up to 20.8%. More and more young people in China cannot find a suitable job, and have to choose a "blue -collar" job that requires physical labor, including delivery, going to the restaurant as a waiter, a online car driver, and so on.</p>
<p>"For the entire Chinese society, graduating from university to do housekeeping, representing the mismatch of human resources further intensified," said Lu Xi, assistant professor of the School of Public Policy of the State University of Singapore, said.</p>
<p>The high unemployment rate has led to a large gap between the rich and the poor. For the high -end service of the housekeeping industry, especially the high -end services responsible for teaching, it does provide a lot of employment opportunities. However, compared to developed economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore, families in need usually choose foreign workers to do housekeeping.</p>
<p>"This follows the principle of comparative advantages in economics, because the cost of foreign workers is low, and they have more comparative advantages in this regard, so hiring them to do it, which is very helpful to improve the overall socioeconomic efficiency." Lu Xi explained Essence</p>

<p>China's demand for "white -collar" people is currently decreasing. According to the estimation of the economist think tank, in 2020, the employment subject is that the professional service positions of college students account for 40%of the total number of young employment opportunities, which is twice as much as ten years ago. However, in recent years, the Chinese government has begun to supervise multiple industries such as real estate, education and training, digital economy, finance, and entertainment, and a considerable part of their positions have gone.</p>
<p>According to the recruitment of Zhilian, China Recruitment Website, in 2021, the recruitment information of real estate, counseling and technology companies accounted for more than half of all graduates' recruitment information. One year later, this number dropped to 26%.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Chinese economy is trending the service industry. The census in 2020 shows that about 75%of young employees have worked in the service industry, but many of the service industries created by China in the past ten years are low Positions, such as takeoffs, restaurant waiters, etc. There are not many jobs for many educated young people who have pursued high wages and high skills.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjing's real estate industry was one of the most affected industries in recent years. The government repeatedly emphasized that "the house is used for living, not for copying." The regulatory agency set the upper limit of the developer's loan and made a comprehensive reform of the land auction. This affects the financial performance of this industry, and many housing companies are stressed.</p>
<p>In order to work hard, Zhang Jingjing worked for more than 10 hours a day, and was irregular. He only slept for five or six hours in the evening. She tried her postgraduate entrance examination, but did not succeed.</p>
<p>At the end of 2021, she found a sales job in the catering industry, but encountered a sluggish market again. At that time, the epidemic was not over, and the catering industry had not fully recovered. In addition, she felt very depressed.</p>
<p>"It's quite collapse. I ca n’t do anything every day at home. I do n’t have a good sleep, and I have no appetite for meals. The whole mood is very low." Four months later, she resigned. Later, she repeatedly applied for other tasks, but none of them were suitable.</p>
<p>She once envious of the company's cleaning aunt. Although the monthly salary is only four or five thousand, "there is no mental pressure, but it is just a bodies. Professional Training".</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a recruitment advertisement in the housekeeping industry attracted Zhang Jingjing's attention, with a monthly salary of 8,000 to 10,000, and even broke her imagination of the "blue -collar" work. She entered the industry with an attitude of trying.</p>
<p>Most of her colleagues are 35 to 55 years old, and some have not read books from the countryside, and some have retired. This line seems a bit large and small for young people who graduate from university, but Zhang Jingjing does not look at it. She said that not only has professional skills training, it helps to develop in this field for a long time, but also get professional certificates and complete internships to complete an internship. Then get a monthly salary of tens of thousands of yuan. She is currently living in Chengdu, and this salary level has reached a commission when she was previously sold.</p>

<p>More and more young people in China cannot find a suitable job, and have to choose a "blue -collar" job that requires physical labor, including delivery.</p>
<h3>"Pigs can take off at the air outlet"</h3>
<p>There are also young people who took the initiative to choose to leave when the industry was transformed, and "self -descending identity" to do some work that requires physical labor.</p>
<p>After graduating from undergraduate in 2016, Chen Chen (a pseudonym) was engaged in home appliance marketing in Chongqing. The time was 7 years, but half a year ago, she resigned from the previous job and transferred to make old clothes for recycling.</p>
<p>The income is half less than before, and it is cheeky and compete with the bottom workers.</p>
<p>She first went to the residential community to distribute leaflets, and also shouted downstairs in the residents with a large horn- "Recycling the old clothes!". This can't help but remind people of China, which was poor dozens of years ago, and honeycomb coal was heated at home. From time to time, I saw the old people with shirts downstairs, pushing a plate of coal, shouting loudly- "Selling honeycomb coal!" People who recycle mineral water bottle and paper skin sip- "Cover!"</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine that a young man with a college diploma can do this. Chen Chen also mocked himself, "I started picking up the rash at a young age", but in her heart, she told herself: "I take 40 years less than others, and they are not going to pick up the rotten when they are old."</p>

<p>Chen Chen received old clothes in a community.</p>
<p>Chen Chen feels that this industry has a prospect, because China currently has a great demand for recycling old clothes, especially in cities with relatively developed industries, clothes are fast -selling products, and they are eliminated quickly. Treat these old clothes.</p>
<p>"No matter the poor and rich people have demand," she said. "Pigs can take off at the air outlet, and people's choices are often more important than hard work."</p>
<p>In the past few years, she has seen the real estate industry who has been engaged in. The first is the sluggish market in the upstream, and the transaction of investing in land and buying and selling commercial housing has decreased. As a result, the owners who need to buy home appliances have decreased and squeezed her income space. She said that when the market is good, the annual income can reach more than 300,000, and now only half are left.</p>
<p>"If you already know that this industry is in the 'red card' market, then you still want to obtain high returns through hard work," Chen Chen said.</p>
<p>In her opinion, during school, as long as she was willing to work hard, she could get good grades and get the corresponding degree, but this thinking is not suitable for today's job market.</p>

<p>Chen Chen believes that the old clothing recycling industry has a prospect in China.</p>
<h3>的</h3>
<p>A few months ago in Chinese society, he enthusiastically discussed whether college students should take off "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65425941">Kong Yiji's gown</a>"——This refers to a descendant scholar in Lu Xun's novels has reached the point of discussing food, but still persistently wearing a long shirt symbolizing identity. In modern China, the academic degree of gown -like university students, taking off the gown means to do some physical strength to do some physical strength. "Blue -collar" job.</p>
<p>Some media have accused young people with unwillingness to rely on labor to change their situation. But young people have their dissatisfaction. "At first, you used 'knowledge to change destiny' to encourage us to learn. Now we feel that employment is difficult to graduate in college, but I have been accused of being unable to let the scholars' shelves and do not want to change their situation by working." This sentence is widely extensive Quote.</p>
<p>Behind these discussions is the continuous expansion of higher education and a serious depreciation degree. According to the Ministry of Education of China, college graduates in 2023 are expected to reach 11.58 million, while only 1 million in 2000. For more than 20 years, college graduates have increased more than 10 times. This is the most educated generation in Chinese history.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the gap between the employment situation of bachelor degree and professional diploma is shrinking. Data in 2022 show that in the past ten years, the employment rate of graduates of vocational colleges has continued to be more than 90%. In some modern service industries, their income and stability may not be worse than undergraduate students.</p>

<p>"Kong Yiji's gown" comes from Lu Xun's novel.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjing in Chongqing had applied for an investment company during his job, but found that the colleagues around him did not even have a bachelor's diploma. The supervisor also had a strong Sichuan spoken language. She thought that she was a child who had come out of the countryside. After graduating from college, she couldn't let go of the pride and left the job a few days later.</p>
<p>"It is a very embarrassing state of high or low," she said. At that time, she was the person who couldn't take off my gown.</p>
<p>Young people are really trying to "take off the gown", but the result is not ideal.</p>
<p>Miss Li in Hangzhou used to do a literary job. Due to the problems of the company's operation, it was unemployed in March this year. After unemployment, she tried to the cinema as a cashier.</p>
<p>Standing for more than seven hours a day, her legs and feet were sore. And the salary is extremely low, "standing for an hour is not enough to buy a cup of milk tea." The most important thing is that she feels that this job has no technical content and is more likely to be eliminated in the future. "There is a feeling of being replaced at any time," she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Li shared her experience on her personal social account, and called on "Kong Yiji's long shirt, don't take off", and received hundreds of responses. Most of the comments are people who have similar experiences with her. They have to be a takeaway runner, go to fast food restaurants as waiters ... But many of them cannot be insisted on because of long working time, low salary, and physical strength.</p>
<p>For them, engaging in the "blue -collar" work is only a brief retreat selected under employment, but it is not a way out. After all, not all "blue -collar" work is an emerging rising industry, and the bottom workers also have their hardships.</p>

<h3>Is it still useful?</h3>
<p>Chen Chen, who was looking for a way out of the way to recover the old clothes road, said that many of her colleagues did not have an academic degree, but she thought that her education was not extra.What she and partners think more is how to accumulate more supply channels, make herself into middlemen through these channels, open up the supply chain, then build brands and communities, publicize on social networks Go to the boss.</p>
<p>This process also used her previously accumulated work experience -how to use the three stages of supply, production and sales in the process of production and operation, so that logistics and funds were continuously flowing and value -added.</p>
<p>"If I have n’t been in school, I have n’t done before, I may not think so. I may only stare at it, thinking that I have received 100 kilograms more today," Chen Chen said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T01-46-34.000Z/_130184183_whatsubject.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>However, she does not recommend to do physical work after graduating from college, because "it is usually reduced to the exploration and thinking of things under the circumstances that the body is very tired."</p>
<p>"Even if you have to go to the factory to make screws in order to survive, you can't come to screw screws. It is more to think about the operation of an industry, such as how the production efficiency of a screw on the assembly line, or the screw can produce effects on the screws to generate effects. What is the mechanical principle. "</p>
<p>Chen Chen has learned the operation of the recycling industry in half a year. In addition to continuing to drive every day on the way to collect old clothes, she has begun to ponder how to build her own brand and how to use social media platforms to promote.</p>
<p>For Zhang Jingjing, who switched to housekeeping, she found her own value. Maybe "taking off the gown" at this time was reasonable. She said that "regret not entering the industry earlier." She no longer wants to go to the postgraduate entrance examination, intends to try more positions in this industry, and learn English at the same time, and try to take the high -end service route in the future.</p>
<p>For her, she can work depends on her love and having a skill. Regardless of whether this job is a "white -collar" profession that can make the villagers proud.</p>

<p><strong> On June 4 this year, a headline news published a headline of the Chinese official media "People's Daily", which accidentally attracted attention. An article called "</strong> <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-06/04/nw.D110000renmrb_20230604_1-01.htm">continuous historical context, compose contemporary Chinese chapter</a>The article of "<strong>" revealed the CCP's leader Xi Jinping inspected the Chinese version of the Chinese version. He simply talked about a manuscript of the Ming Dynasty with the museum personnel, and mentioned that the independent "Ryukyu Kingdom" (now Okinawa) and Fujian of Fujian at that time were mentioned. History. Regarding news accidentally touched China -Japan sensitive nerves. </strong></p>
<p>Lin Quanzhong, a researcher at the Hong Kong Asia -Pacific Research Center of the University of Hong Kong, told BBC in Chinese that since April this year, because of the news of Dennistamaki, a Zhicheng of Okinawa Prefecture, intends to visit Beijing this summer "" ". The last time was in 2003, and also the "People's Daily" editorial about the "sovereign dispute" of Okinawa, which caused fierce discussions in Chinese and Japanese politics and the people.</p>
<p>Lin Quanzhong, who has been teaching at Ryukyu University, who has been at the University of Ryukyu in Okinawa for many years, explained that this time it should be a text that "consciously choice" involved in Ryukyu history and commented to Xi Jinping. It can be seen that the two information. "First of all, Beijing seems to emphasize that in the moment when China -Japan relations are not harmonious, China can have a special friendly relationship with Ryukyu; then it is that the status of Ryukyu belongs not to Japan, and it should be discussed. "</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-65529713">The first island chain: Bynden re -connected the breakout of Asian allies and China</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-47410306">Conversion of the military threats of the Chinese and North Korea military threats to Okinawa U.S. military base is of great significance</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64100994">Asia -Pacific arms race competition and Sino -Japanese relations under the influence of Japanese defense expenditures</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/fooc-41929348">Reporter Laihong: Okinawa -the American complex is difficult to cut? </a>However, is Okinawa folks who see the fermentation of the "Ryukyu problem"? Professor Lin Quanzhong pointed out to the BBC that the answer should be denied. He explained that 10 years ago, at the time, the Okinawa Daily News "Ryukyu Times" criticized the "People's Daily" that involved the issue of Okinawa: "The folk believes that the East China Sea is getting more and less calm, and China will take responsibility .... After 10 years, the society and politics of Okinawa have no major changes, and Okinawa society has not suddenly moved closer to China. " Lin Quanzhong also said that according to the survey of his past in Okinawa, more than half of the public opinion that was unwilling to independent.</p>
<p>As for Beijing's position, Lin Quanzhong wrote in the Hong Kong media "Ming Pao" that Beijing should not be in the foreseeable future, and officially proposed that China does not recognize that Okinawa is a new position in Japan's territory. Unless Japan is highly involved in the "Taiwan issue" in the future, Beijing will Will not rashly hit the "Okinawa card".</p>
<p>But in any case, how does China's "Ryukyu Hot" rise? Whether Xi Jinping's "Okinawa Card" has begun to line up in China and Japan and even tense India -Pacific competitions, it has begun to attract regional attention: Xi Jinping wants to use "Ryukyu Hot" through "Ryukyu Hot" What kind of political effects or income to achieve?

<p>After the rise of China, Okinawa became an important mark of China's "first island chain" to prevent China.</p>
<p>In fact, the centuries of the complicated history of Okinawa and Japan and the military strategic position of tens of thousands of U.S. military stationed in Okinawa after World War II have made Okinawa, which has a population of more than 1 million, has always been a key island in the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>After the rise of China, Okinawa became an important mark of China's "first island chain" to prevent China. However, the residents of Okinawa have always seen their own opinions on the Island's tragic ground war history and the death of the people in the island in the island's tragic ground war. At the moment when the United States and Japan Alliance counted the military expansion of China, the Macaugomya Tani, who was re -elected in 2022 and was affiliated to the Japanese Wild Party Liberal Party, reported that it would visit Beijing in early July this year.</p>
<p>Born in Yutong Danny (also known as Yucheng Kangyu) in Okinawa in 1959, his father was an American soldier who was stationed in Okinawa. Before Yucheng, Yicheng was a well -known Japanese entertainer. After politics, he has been demanding that the US military stationed in Okinawa was regarded as the "suspicious American school" of Okinawa politics. He was elected in Okinawa in 2018 and publicly opposed the national funeral for former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and he himself did not attend Abe's funeral.</p>
<p>Lin Quanzhong told BBC Chinese that Yicheng's plan to visit Beijing this time and disclosed the media delegation for the media to disclose the political and trade delegation composed of Tokyo's Tokyo, which means that it emphasizes that Okinawa belongs to Japan, which is undoubted. However, after Yucheng left Beijing, he would go south to visit Fuzhou, Okinawa Sisters City. At that time, he would meet which important Chinese person in China, which is worth observing.</p>

<p>Yucheng Danny will visit Beijing and Fuzhou this year; in August, it will be visited in Taipei.</p>
<p>In addition, Professor Lin Quanzhong added that on April 1 this year, the Okinawa County Government set up a "regional diplomatic room", because Okinawa was uneasy about the safety of the surrounding area, that is, the so -called "Taiwan Strait). The Okinawa people do not want Okinawa to become the battlefield again, because they have experienced the worst battle in the Pacific Battle during World War II, and they feel deeply in the tragedy of the lives of the people on the island. The will of peace. Yucheng also plans to visit Taiwan in August this year.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Xi Jinping's first publicly touching the Ryukyu issue should be paving the way for Yucheng to visit China, and at the same time, he gave a "Okinawa card" to the not too close Sino -Japanese relations to test the response from Japan.</p>
<h3>Beijing "Okinawa"?Dr. Satorunagao, a very resident of the Hudson Institute of Washington Conservative Think Tank, told BBC Chinese that Beijing's comments or behaviors for Okinawa have been in line with the expansion of Chinese territorial expansion in recent years.</h3>
<p>He believes that the means of expanding military in Beijing in the East China Sea, South China Sea, South Pacific, and even India -China borders have the same characteristics, namely through non -military means, such as infrastructure project investment (the “Belt and Road”, the Asian Investment Bank, etc.) Industry investment or economic stress (for Australia, or Pacific islands, etc.) expand China's strength and territory. He said to BBC in Chinese, "For example, China can output many passengers to Okinawa, let the Okinawa people make money, or invite Okinawa County to visit."</p>
<p>From the perspective of Japan's position, Naga Hyun said that this is a trap, because China can suddenly ban passengers from going to Okinawa and then pressure to the Okinawa government. "Palau (Palau) has also happened in the past."</p>

<h3>"Ryukyu Hot" how to start?</h3>
<p>The Chinese official media "People's Daily" and Xinhua News Agency published the "documentary" article of Xi Jinping's inspection of the National Edition of China on June 1 on June 4. The article emphasizes how the museum introduces Xi Jinping in detail a manuscript exhibition product of the Ming Dynasty manuscript "Make Ryukyu Record", which describes the old connection between Fujian Province and the independent "Ryukyu Kingdom" that year. The article, also known as the museum, emphasizes that the manuscript has important political significance, that is, it indicates that the Diaoyu Islands (known as the islands of Jian Ge in Japan, and Taiwan known as Diaoyutai) is a Chinese territory.</p>
<p>The "People's Daily" article also recounted Xi Jinping's response, "When I was working in Fuzhou, I knew that there were Ryukyu Hall, Ryukyu Tomb, and Ryukyu in Fuzhou. At that time, there were 36 surnames of Fujian entered Ryukyu." Xi Jinping also emphasized, "It is necessary to strengthen the collection of classics and versions, and to inherit and develop Chinese civilization." The article also mentioned that the construction of the Chinese version of the Chinese version was approved by Xi Jinping himself.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Xi Jinping has worked in Fujian for 17 years and has served as the secretary of the Fujian Municipal Party Committee. According to Nikkeasia (Nikkeasia), he also met with visitors from Okinawa and claimed to be the descendants of the "Minutes of the Fujian" descendants.</p>
<p>The British "Economist" published a comment article last week that at first glance, Xi Jinping's remarks seemed to be far from the current political distance, and in 1949, the CCP had never put forward sovereignty on the Ryukyu Islands since the establishment of politics.</p>
<p>However, for many years, many Chinese scholars, military officials, or analysts have been interested in Japan's history of domination of these islands, and even questioned. In 2013, the People's Daily had mentioned that because of controversy in the Diaoyu Islands, it was first mentioned that "Okinawa" first mentioned "Okinawa. The theory of sovereignty has triggered the first wave of "Ryukyu fever" in China, but it also led to high -profile protests from Japanese high -level high -level protests.</p>

<p>Okinawa is eager to maintain regional peace.</p>
<p>In 2022, after the Japanese Prime Minister Kishita, after a conversation of the "50th Anniversary of Okinawa's Return", Hong Kong's "Asian Weekly" subsequently published a "love between Okinawa and China" written by "Mao Feng" written in "Mao Feng" <a href="https://www.yzzk.com/article/details/%E5%B0%81%E9%9D%A2%E5%B0%88%E9%A1%8C/2022-21/1652930244705/%E6%B2%96%E7%B9%A9%E8%88%87%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E7%9A%84%E6%83%85%E7%B7%A3">Article</a>In detail how Okinawa integrates the "traditional Chinese culture", including the profound Chinese heritage of Okinawa, it still retains the Lunar New Year, which is no longer celebrated by the Japanese island after celebrating the "Meiji Restoration" every year. Mao Feng's article can be said to be the so -called "Ryukyu heat" epitome of Chinese folks.</p>
<p>For example, the article emphasizes the two generations of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The "Ryukyu Kingdom" uses the Chinese year. It also uses Chinese characters to indicate that the "Ryukyu Kingdom" has a deep relationship with "China". Mao Feng's article also mentioned that, according to his historical evidence, more than a hundred years after the Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, Ryukyu sent tribute to the tribute. The Ryukyu Waste Seal County officially forcibly merged with Ryukyu into Japan and set it as Okinawa Prefecture.</p>

<p>However, when the first wave of "Okinawa Hot" in 2013, the Japanese current Affairs News Agency quoted a Chinese diplomatic document on July 28, 1964 that when the United States was required to hand over Okinawa sovereignty, then the then CCP leader Mao Zedong Zedong He once told the deputy minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "of course, Okinawa, to Japan," and sent a telegram to the Chinese embassy in the Chinese abroad. The current affairs news agency said that the information was found in the original foreign telegram collected by the History of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.</p>
<p>Okinawa was forcibly governed by the United States after World War II and sent garrison. On May 15, 1972, the United States abandoned the administrative, judicial and legislative power of Ryukyu, and was transferred to Japan. The Okinawa Prefecture was established again. The yen was used as a currency, which was called "Okinawa's return".</p>

<p>From the bird's -eye view of the middle of Okinawa, we can see that the U.S. Air Force Base (left) and the Kaisa Air Force Base (information photo on December 12, 2021) can be seen.Professor June Teufeldreyer, an expert in Sino -Japanese relations research experts at the University of Miami, said in an interview with "Economist" that when Zhongnanhai wants to propose controversial claims, it may be mentioned in a low -key meeting before handing it out, and then handed it over. Cited to government documents or official media, and subsequently publicized by senior officials: "This is a method of creating a faithful facts step by step."</p>

<p>Ishigaki Island in Okinawa is only 200 kilometers away from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Professor James R. Holmes of the School of War of the United States Naval Conservatory told BBC in Chinese that he agreed that Xi Jinping's historical issue of Ryukyu had a dual intention of politics and military.</p>
<p>Holmes explained that the purpose of military services is to provide choices for policy makers. The former plans that many outsiders may think that they may seem ridiculous. For example, in the era when the U.S. Navy has established a special relationship with Britain, the U.S. Navy still writes a plan to fight the British, even if there is no possibility of the British and American wars at the time.</p>
<p>He pointed out: "But you never know -so we tend to think about unimaginable things in advance. We (the United States) has made the same plan on the issue of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Very small. In the last time (10 years ago), in the storm caused by the Ryukyu issue, I speculated about the possible process of this battle in "Foreign Policy". "</p>
<p>Holmes analysis that has long promoted the strategy of the United States at the ISland Chain strategy that Xi Jinping's comments about Okinawa this time are "simple ways to cause trouble politically to Japan."</p>
<p>He said that in the era of China and the Japanese Empire, Ryukyu has an overglage situation in its position, "enables both Chinese and Japanese big brothers to get Ryukyu's respect. This also gives Xi Jinping some room for exhibition: Beijing does not need to need You can get some important strategic benefits to Okinawa. "</p>
<p>But in military, Homs believes that Okinawa's independence will certainly be very helpful to Beijing. Because the latter can leave these islands from Japan's sovereignty in some way, rebuild an independent, weak neighbor country, and will also allow the Japanese Self -Defense Force's facilities to evacuate from these islands, eliminating the "expeditionary base of the expedition to the US Marine Corps The concept of combat, (this concept is imagined to set up mobile defensive military forces on the island chain to prevent the PLA navy from breaking the first island chain).</p>
<p>He said: "I want to emphasize that it is unlikely that the PLA attacks the Ryukyu part or all of the operation. But the incident in the past few years reminds us that the authoritarian countries may make outsiders' unlikely sound and arrears of action. . For example, China will build artificial islands in the South China Sea to claim sovereignty over the vast waters. It was previously considered to be nonsense by outsiders. Therefore, at least we should think about this possibility (war in Okinawa) this time. If you have never thought of things, you won't be caught off guard. "</p>
<p>Changwei Xian analyzed the BBC Chinese, because the range of Chinese missiles is expanding, and the military deployment balance around Okinawa is changing. He said that the US military base in Okinawa is not a safe place for the United States. The United States currently has 54 F-15 fighters in Okinawa. After that, the United States will deploy the F-22 fighter, but the base of rotation deployment.</p>
<p>He emphasized: "The United States believes that if these fighters are deployed to permanent bases, it will easily become the target of Chinese missile attacks. In Beijing, the United States is withdrawn from Okinawa. It will expand territorial claims. Therefore, Xi Jinping's remarks about Okinawa are to observe and check the opponent. "</p>
<p>Changwei Xian said that if the PLA on the east coast of Taiwan, that is, the Pacific side is deployed enough military forces, it is necessary to cross the coast of the Okinawa area, but if the missiles deployed in Japan and the United States, the PLA prevents the PLA from crossing Okinawa and other Southwest islands in Japan. China It is difficult to deploy military forces on the East Coast of Taiwan.</p>

His commander Ulin worshiped German musician Wagner, and the legion was named.</p>

<h4>佣 24 -hour short -lived riot</h4>
<h3>Porigo does not accept the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>The Wagner Legion has been active on the front line of the war, such as playing an extremely important role in Bachmum's surrounding war. However, in recent months, fierce quarrels broke out with the senior executives of the Russian army, and believed that the Ministry of National Defense did not provide enough ammunition supply during the Bach Murut Campaign. Husbands should be responsible for the large number of casualties of the Wagner Mercenary Soldiers. Since June, the Russian Ministry of Defense demanded that the mercenaries have signed an agreement to obey the command before the end of the month. This seems to be tantamount to disarm, and the contradictions have been further intensified.</p>

<p>On June 26, the Russian Defense Minister Shao Yigu, who was accused of "incompetence", was named "incompetent" on TV, explaining that he inspected the frontline troops, but no time and place were not explained. However, people are more concerned about the whereabouts of Porigerin. According to the agreement reached with Belarus, he should go there. Reached? His journalist informed, "Porigerjin asked everyone. Once you can send and receive information, he will answer everyone's question."</p>

<h3>How many people will follow him?</h3>
<p>In theory, he can take his mercenaries to Belarus. Not sure how many people will follow him. However, the business of the Wagner Legion is all over the world. Libya, Syria, Africa, and Venezuela in Latin America are the place where the mercenaries are made. Soldiers who were on the battlefield allegedly could get 5,000 US dollars per month. Porigabin claims that there are still 25,000 troops, and the US intelligence unit estimates that this number should double.(Comprehensive report)</p>

<h3>"Kecha Tie", "Wang Kang Meimei" to "Nana" who planned for patriotic wealth "crooked fruit kernels"</h3>

<p><strong> Over the past few months, a man in China has attracted more than 300,000 fans. He claimed that he was a Russian soldier who fought at the front line of Ukraine, but people found that he was actually located in Henan Province, China. </strong></p>
<p>Douyin stated in a statement issued last week that he had banned his account indefinitely because he imitated Russian soldiers' "picking traffic".</p>
<p>The man's account is called "Paul Koccar", which is obviously inspired by Pavel Korchagin.</p>
<p>In the film, the man with a beacon and a beard said Mandarin. He called himself a soldier of Chechen Special Forces.</p>
<p>"Hello, friends in China, we are now the nuclear power plant in Harkov, Ukraine." He said in a widely reposted film.</p>
<p>In other films, he also claimed that he had detained the Ukraine President Volodymyrzlensky and caught American soldiers although there were currently no active American soldiers participated in the Ukrainian war.</p>
<p>With the popularity of these films, he was able to sell Russian products including vodka and honey in his online store. After its true identity was revealed, some netizens commented on the comments and ridiculed this approach "creative sales, cooperated with the people's conditions", and mastered the "traffic password".</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Netizens found that his IP address is in Henan, China, not what he calls the Ukrainian front line.</p>
<p>However, some netizens found doubts, such as his speaking with Chinese dialect, and the IP address of his account showed that he was in Henan Province. According to regulatory requirements, many social media in China will currently display the IP address of the postpoders.</p>
<p>It is also found that the so -called "nuclear power plant" in his video is actually a power plant in Luoyang, Henan.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese media "SIXTH TONE", he was finally found to use Deepfake technology and artificial intelligence tools to change his appearance and make false identities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-45470429">Fake news, how does the technology circle "fake"? </a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-49589980">Chinese face -changing video application is popular and caused security concerns</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-42987060">Star -changing face porn videos were blocked by the website</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-60333169">Deep counterfeit: "How can I fall into the love river?"</a>After being exposed, "Paul Kococar" deleted all the films and changed the account name to "Wang Kang Mei".</p>
<p>In China, this is not the first time that the content creators on social media have used foreign identities to make money online.</p>
<p>Last year, a woman who claimed to be from Russia and named "Nana" became popular because of sharing her life in China, attracting nearly 2 million fans, and sold a large number of products.</p>
<p>However, the account was eventually revealed that a Chinese was faked Russians through makeup and use of face -changing special effects tools. After being criticized by user complaints and official media, they were named.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the China National Internet Information Office issued the "Regulations on the Management of In -depth Synthetic Synthesis of Internet Information Services", requiring that in -depth synthetic service providers to find that the use of deep synthetic services to produce and disseminate false information shall be "timely rumored measures."</p>
<p>This regulation also requires that in -depth synthetic service providers should be marked in the "reasonable position" of the content of information content when providing synthetic vocals and face replacement services.</p>

The official website of Leshan Grand Buddha Scenic Area(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt1-06272023040004.html/@@stream)The Sichuan Leshan Scenic Area Management Committee has recently been exposed to the 30 -year management right of Leshan Great Buddha for 30 years. In addition, public hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai and other places are not allowed to accompany the patients' family members, and the hospital provides charging care services. In addition, many restaurants in Shanghai were fined for selling cold dishes. All of these phenomena are because of finance tight.</p>

It is reported that Sichuan "sold Leshan Great Buddhas a few days ago", and was equipped with a bid picture titled "The Overall Transfer of the Rights of Tourist Tour and the Stalls for Thirty years of Management Rights". According to the official account of many media such as cover news, this Tuesday (27th) news, on June 26, the cover journalist learned from the Leishan Great Buddha Scenic Area Management Committee that the transaction did exist, but it was not recent, but a few years ago. Relevant parties said that this is a normal job in accordance with the relevant management regulations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T04-01-00-04-00/000001.png" />Leshan Great Buddha Scenic Area sold its operating rights for the base price of 1.7 billion yuan.(Network picture/ancient pavilion provided)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt1-06272023040004.html/m0627-gt1p1.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T04-01-00-04-00/000002.png" /></a>Public information shows that the start and end date of this project is from October 26 to November 29, 2021. The 30 -year operation right of the scenic tourist tour and the stalls was shot by Leshan Great Buddha Industrial Co., Ltd. However, the relevant authorities have never disclosed the matter.</p>
<p><strong> Netizens tease that there is no money for the Forbidden City and can sell anything. </strong></p>
<p>Leshan student Zhou Xuan said in an interview with Radio Free Asia that she just learned the news and saw that the netizens were discussing the selling of Leshan Great Buddhas. It is a Buddha. If it is a Buddha how can the Buddha sell it, you can change money now. Because the financial appropriation is not so much, the governments of all local governments are called poor now. If you have no money, you will declare bankruptcy. "</p>
<p>Leshan Great Buddha is located in Emeishan, Sichuan. In December 1996, it was included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO. Netizens have commented on Leshan to sell the Buddha. A netizen teased that as long as the power is large enough, the Buddha can sell it, the airport can be sold, and the railway can be sold. Some people add that the country can sell. It is also recommended to sell the operating rights of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Badaling Great Wall, Summer Palace, etc. can also sell a good price. Another netizen responded that a "sad story", Leshan Great Buddha only sold 1.7 billion in 30 years. If it sold Dalian for 30 years, it may be 17 billion yuan, only because the government lacks money.</p>
<p>In addition, finance is reflected in various fields. According to netizens, public hospitals in various places charged patients due to insufficient funds. Recently, Yangguang.com reported that Ms. Wang, Yunnan, reported that in mid -April this year, her family was hospitalized for 11 days in a hospital in Beijing due to neurotum. The hospital was not allowed to accompany her family. Essence It is also necessary to withstand the accommodation cost of low prices, and economic pressure is great.</p>

He said: "200 yuan is low every day, Shanghai is 300 to 400 yuan, and the three hospitals receive 400 yuan to accompany for one day. He (hospital) said it was paid to the caregiver. Shanghai Hospital, stayed for 20 days, 8,000 yuan, amazing, they are not allowed to accompany their families now.</p>
<p>Some Weibo netizens said that the caregivers hired by the hospital have received medical training and have more professional knowledge than their families. Or more patients, there are also nurses who go directly to the job without receiving training. But charges are one -on -one.</p>
<p><strong> Guangzhou Hospital is allowed to receive 40 yuan per day </strong></p>
<p>However, hospitals across Guangdong still allow family members to accompany them. Mr. Ma Fang, a resident of Guangzhou, told reporters that he was accompanied by his brother in the hospital. The hospital did not implement the care system, but his family members had to pay the accompanying fee to the hospital: "In Guangzhou, the hospital did not say that the hospital was not allowed to ask the caregiver. Yuan Geng (to the hospital), if you accompany the bed at night, add 20 yuan. "Not only that, fines are also an increase in income. The Shanghai Market Supervision and Administration Department has recently increased fines on operating the catering industry. According to websites such as Jimu News, on June 8th, the punished shop owner told Jimu Journalists that the store was punished because of the sale of Liangpi. The staff of the market regulatory authorities involved responded that the relevant administrative penalties were carried out in accordance with laws and regulations, and food permits should be obtained in accordance with laws and regulations. In addition, many restaurants in Anhui were fined 5,000 yuan for selling "cucumbers". A number of restaurants in Zhuzhou in Hunan were fined for selling cucumbers for selling cucumbers.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-27T04-04-21-08-00/26schmemann-master1050.jpg" />Regardless of what the purpose of Yofgeni Pleigo wants to achieve through the rebellion, the facts have proved that his plan is short and stupid. His tanks and soldiers traveled to Moscow's high -speed dry line for less than 24 hours. The mercenary head was persuaded and transferred to the direction, and he ran to Belarus to take refuge. The problem is what will happen next, especially for Putin, will the failure of this failure weaken or strengthen his power, or make him resentful?</p>
<p>At first Putin vowed to suppress the rebellion on television, called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-24/putin-says-mutiny-internal-treason-warns-of-harsh-punishment?sref=B3uFyqJT">"betrayal", "betrayal" and "soldiers"</a>Essence Witnesses took pictures of the Russian armed helicopter bombard the rebels and dig ditches on the road ahead to prevent the rebels from moving forward.</p>
<p>But in a short speech to the country, Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/world/europe/russia-wagner-prigozhin.html">never mentioned</a>Porigon and his mercenaries, the infamous Wagner Group. (It is said that his name is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/world/europe/wagner-group-russia-ukraine.html">a new Nazi close friend in Pritigo</a>This person has a pseudonym Wagner to commemorate the 19th -century composer Richard Wagner, which is commemorating Hitler. ) Instead of immediately suppressing the Wagner rebels, it triggered a fatal fierce internal fighting, Putin chose to forbearance. He used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/world/europe/lukashenko-belarus-russia-ukraine.html">Essentially controlled by himself</a>Belarusian dictator Lukashenko, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/25/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-news-ukraine">for amnesty's commitment</a>Temptation of Porigo gave up his reckless rebellion.</p>
<p>But how the real situation is still puzzled. According to the Times report, American intelligence agencies have noticed last Wednesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/world/europe/us-intel-prigozhin-warning.html">signs of the rebellion are brewing</a>Essence</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The statement that has been circulating in social media is that this rebellion was done from beginning to end, and it may even be planned by Putin for some puzzling reasons. Such theory is currently not confirmed, and it may be for a long time in the future. Considering the crazy invasion of Ukraine and the incompetence of the Russian army, everything is possible.</p>
<p>But the motivation of the rebellion is also likely to be simpler: more than a political conspiracy, Pryigo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/yevgeny-prigozhin-russia-wagner-coup.html">this knows the cruelty violence</a>The villain eventually decided to defeat his eyes -Minister of Defense Sergei Shoygu. For how to cope with the Ukrainian war, Pricigen <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-65996531">contradiction with Shaygu</a>For a long time, he accused Shaygou <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-attempted-coup-mercenaries-wagner-rebellion-rcna90921">failing</a>Give Vagna Group sufficient support.</p>
<p>Porigen is a typical villain in the post -Soviet era. He spent most of his time in the prison in the 1980s. When the Soviet Union was disintegrated, he made a lot of money in the heavenly gold rush fever. The reason why he can get close to Putin is part of the reason for providing a service for his national banquet (which also gives him the name of "Putin Chef" that he has ironic, although <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-wagner-group-prigozhin-putins-butcher-ukraine-war-russian-revolution/">he said</a>I never cook by myself). Many of the evil behaviors of Porigan include the establishment of a close relationship with Putin in 2014 [Wagner Group] during the invasion of Crimea in Russia in 2014 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/world/europe/wagner-group-russia-ukraine.html">Wagner Group</a>Essence Since then, Wagner's mercenaries have traveled to many countries to perform tasks, including Libya, Syria and the Republic of China, and the Kremlin often supports but does not want to admit it.</p>
<p>Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in Russia, the Wagner Group was put into the battlefield and suffered heavy casualties. Porigen started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/world/europe/russia-wagner-ukraine-video.html">recruiting prisoners</a>And promise that if they survive, they can get freedom, but many people have not seen that day. He also began to publicly scold Shaoyu and other Russian commanders, accusing them of not providing sufficient weapons and ammunition for themselves, and -at a broader and dangerous level -criticizing them completely messed up this war.It is difficult to predict the evolution of the next situation. An well -known brutal militia organization opens public changes, and Putin is destined to calm the rebellion in a basically non -bleeding way, which is destined to bring serious political consequences to Russia. Whether it is to Russia or to black, all the results I have ever conceived are not optimistic.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Putin, a dictator who is obsessed with Ukraine, is likely to seek upgrading to Ukraine and West that his power has not been weakened. He may also want to prove that the chaos and incompetence of the army in Pricigen Renkou are nonsense, but they may still need to deal with several commanders to show that he is the chief commander of all -known. of.</p>
<p>Within a few hours after the attempted rebellion, Russia launched a large number of missiles and drones to Ukraine. With the strong counterattack of Ukraine, Putin may also begin to issue a new dark threat. One week before Porigon took action, the well -known diplomacy and national defense policy expert Sergei Karaginov published an article that Russia needs to "reduce the threshold of the use of nuclear weapons and make nuclear deterrence once again convincing the opinion of".</p>
<p>Putin may also find some ways to blame the rebellion in the United States, but Washington has always carefully avoided suggesting that he has any relationship with Porigo. For example, the US intelligence agency was postponed to the end of the incident that the content they heard inadvertently.</p>
<p>Strangely, the historical ratio used by Putin in his speech was the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and the revolution forced Russia to achieve humiliation with Germany. Although Bolsshvik overthrew the Romanov dynasty and was the pioneer of the Soviet Union, Putin lamented the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Such a word describes Russia into a loser.</p>
<p>After this obvious rebellion, Putin would have to reiterate his supreme status and authority in China. Parig has never accused the president of any failure, but has adopted a familiar strategy to accuse his opponent of suffering from this absolutely correct leader, and Putin can also be satisfied with the march without the Russian army to join the Wagner forces. Essence Nevertheless, Pricig's accusations of the war was poor, and it was launched for wrong reasons. This was a blow for Putin, and he needed to find scapegoats.</p>
<p>As we all know, the failure of the failure is also used as a tool by dictators and strong man leaders to deal with enemies who are real or imagined. In the 1950s, "Doctor Conspiracy](https://www.britannica.com/event/Doctors-Plot)"After that, Stalin began to clean up the leadership of the Communist Party. Relatively late, Turkish President Rejuep Tetip Erdogan quickly took action after the attempted coup in 2016. arrest.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Putin opened the door for the new suppression of Russia, and it may also suppress more vicious suppression to anyone who questioned him in Russian elite or leadership. In his speech, he did not name Perigo Ren, but warned, "Anyone who consciously embark on the road of betrayal, prepare for armed rebellion, take a ransom and terrorist road will inevitably be punished." This may be possible. Including anyone he wants to remove.</p>
<p>This has led to the issue of the fate of Perigon and Wagner. Russia's history is full of uprising and power of power, but the rebels rarely have a good ending. In a key battle in 1709, the Cossacks who followed Ivan Maza Papa betrayed the Emperor Peter, instead supported Sweden, and subsequently seduced and surrendered by the promise of amnesty. In the end, they were killed, and the corpse drifted on the Dieber River.</p>
<p>For Pryigon, the more appropriate story may be the story of Emilian Pigjevolf. The Cossack led a large -scale rebellion against Emperor Yekaterina in the 19770s. Her murderer Peter III. Farmers' anger for corrupt Russian military leadership is not the only reason for the rebellion. This rebellion is well known to the Russians through Alexander Pushkin's novel "Captain's Daughter".</p>
<p>In the story, the Russian binquet issued a famous warning: "But ask God to open up, don't let the world see this meaningless and cruel Russian riots!People who fail to change are either young and ignorant. They do not understand the people of our country, or they are the hearts of the iron stone. They joked with others' heads and improper their necks. " Daughter ", published in 2006 of Shanghai Translation Publishing House. —— Translation Note)</p>
<p>Pigjev was arrested in Moscow and publicly beheaded. His legendary story triggered the term "Pigjevhv", which used to refer to the Russians' tendency to be meaningless and destined to fail.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that Putin will allow Pleigo to serve as well -no matter what his promise has made. Even if Putin has never named Pleigo, he must prove his promise to the Russian people: "Those who organize and prepare for military rebellion, those who use weapons to deal with comrades have betrayed Russia and will be used as to be it as and will be it as to be it as a weapon and will be it as a weapon. This is responsible. "Pricigen seems to be going to Belarus. He knows that the leaders there are completely subject to Putin, so this is not a safe haven.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>As for the Wagner Group, Putin may be more tolerant. He needs these mercenaries in Ukraine and elsewhere, and may put it under the closer control of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>He is unlikely to be forgotten regardless of the fate of Pritigo. His outbreak publicly revealed many setbacks of Russia's real and huge casualties in the war, as well as many setbacks suffered by Russia's poor leadership and error messages. As the war enters the second summer, these problems may still exist. When the mercenaries retreated from Rostov on the banks of the River, people shouted, "Wagner!Wagner!" Russia's rebellion history often regards rebels as heroes, no matter what they perform. A few centuries ago, the pseudo -Dimitri praised in the opera "Boris Gendunov" actually became the Russian tsar in the "difficult period" -s, although it is undeniable that the time is not long.</p>

One of the places, and this is the pride.</p>
<p>The new allegations appear almost every day, causing discussions on talk show programs and social media, leading to newspapers comment and activity group calling to give victims <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2023/06/19/2003801749">stronger protection</a>Essence</p>
<p>In many ways, the major progress made by women in Taiwan is noticeable. Before the "#Metoo" movement rose before the rise of the United States, Taiwan women helped choose the first female president in the local area and strengthened the punishment rape and sexual assault. law. However, the continuous latest sexual harassment allegations show that as activists and scholars have pointed out, the deep -rooted gender discrimination makes women vulnerable to harm in the workplace. Charges.</p>

The earliest allegations that were "#too" were the senior members of her party, which constituted a risk of the reputation of the DPP in young voters.

<p>The large number of allegations was caused by a popular TV series "Candidate -Creator" on the previous political Taiwan politics. There is a second plot of the play: a female party member of a political party told her boss that she had been sexually harassed by a party member of the party. Her boss promised to help her handle harassment and said, "We don't just count it." This statement shows that this allegations that cause political trouble are often ignored.</p>
<p>The words of the fictional boss became a loud slogan, which evoked more than 100 accusors of women who mainly women who mainly women who mainly women who were mainly women on social media. Case. They describe the insulting behavior of the workplace, including the improper touch of male colleagues and male bosses, unpopular teasing, and vulgar comments. Some of these posts have been shared thousands of times.</p>

<p>This wave of allegations is particularly risky for the Democratic Progressive Party led by President Tsai Ing -wen. Among those who were charged with sexual harassment and tried to make the accusors' sings, some senior officials of the DPP and government forced Tsai Ing -wen to apologize to the DPP twice. These criticisms of the DPP as a record of liberal values advocate, these records include legalizing homosexual marriage in 2019, and given the right to adopt children to adopt children earlier this year. Taiwan will hold the presidential election next year, which will also constitute the reputation of the DPP in young voters.</p>
<p>"The Democratic Progressive Party has always considered himself a political party that supports gender equality," said in an interview with the DPP Legislative member of the DPP, and she was also a professor of gender issues specializing in gender issues in Taiwan University. "Everyone thinks that this drama is filming the DPP, this part will have a great impact."</p>

<p>One of the highest -level officials accused of harassment of sexual harassment was Yan Zhifa. He denied the allegations, but resigned from the post of President Tsai Ing -wen. The Supreme Legal Agency in Taiwan stated that it will be the former dean of the Court of Court <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/202306200106.aspx">Li</a><a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/202306200106.aspx">Bo Dao</a>The investigation of the allegations of sexual harassment. DPP senior official Cai Mulin was accused of coercing a female party member to stay silent. She once reported to Cai Mulin that a male colleague tried to enter her hotel room.</p>
<p>Cai Mulin has resigned (he has no relative relationship with Cai Yingwen). Chen Wenxuan, accusing Cai Mulin's woman, said that other women who shared her experience increased her confidence in public voice. "This movement makes me know that there is nothing unjust, and it should be swallowed," she said. "After all, we can't just forget it."</p>
<p>Men who have been accused also include members of the Kuomintang of the opposition, as well as more extensive Taiwanese society, involving academia, press, and recent performing arts.</p>
<p>TV celebrity Huang Zijiao apologized. Previously, he was accused of kissing her without consent and forcing her to take nude photos. The popular singer Yan Yalun also apologized.

<p>In some ways, the "#Metoo" campaign shows that the difficult progress made by women for women in the past decades has brought about intergenerational changes in attitudes. Due to the curriculum reform plan promulgated in 2004, the younger generation in Taiwan has begun to learn gender equality since elementary school, and they have now entered into an adult.</p>
<p>But the workplace is difficult to keep up with their pace.</p>

<p>The younger generation of Taiwan "has a high perception of gender and equality compared to older generations", Yan Weiting, a government assistant professor at Franklin and Marshall College, Pennsylvania, said, "But the workplace culture entered by young people is still being entrusted. The older generation holds control. "</p>
<p>The legislators have promised to quickly revise the law and ask each institution to bear the responsibility of protecting the harassment victims so that the workplace and schools are safer. The amendment regulations require the agency to follow up and set up an independent third -party investigation team when necessary. The feminine organization calls on Taiwan to extend the time limit of sexual harassment complaints, and the current period is one year.Lai Yufen, 27 years old, accused Polish diplomat Li Bo on his Facebook and Twitter accounts this month(Bartosz Ryś)He was sexually assaulted by Li Bo last year. She said that after reporting to the police, investigators asked her why she apologized to him when refusing to be in love with the diplomat, and why did she tell her family. She said that a defense lawyer told her in front of a friend. "I want to take my story back," Ms. Lai said in an interview.</p>
<p>The Polish office in Taipei (that is, the facts of the Polish Embassy in Taiwan) confirmed that it is cooperating with the authorities to investigate. The prosecutor had decided not to sue Li Bo, and he left Taiwan after his term of office last year. Li Bo did not reply to the reporter's comment request sent by an email, but he wrote on his Twitter that Ms. Lai asked him to ask him for money in exchange for giving up allegations. (She said that the problem of money is part of the negotiating legal solution.)</p>
<p>For those who are engaged in civil rights and social work in Taiwan, the most worrying allegations are the leaders who have influential rights in the eyes of the public. Wang Dan, a 29 -year -old activist Li Yuanjun, has publicly accused Chinese senior democratic disgust this month, saying that Wang Dan had pressed him on the bed in 2014 to ask for sexual relationships. Li Yuanjun said that he was suing Wang Dan.</p>

High, tax reduction policy has not been fully implemented, and the disadvantages of artificial regulation of income scale and poor local financial management.</p>
<p>Financial commentator Cai Shenkun said in an interview with this station on Tuesday: "The Chief Audit Director has been controlled by the Central Government for a long time. The agency means to implement the leaders, and the audit department of various places. It is to conduct anti -corruption for some departments or institutions that they are not satisfied with. They will be carried out through the Audit Department. The Audit Office plays the economic audit role of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission to a certain extent. "</p>
<p><strong> The Audit Office announced that the Discipline Inspection Commission will follow up </strong></p>
<p>The audit of the "Report" found that 70 regions used state -owned assets and fictional land transactions such as "self -selling and self -buying", and fiscal revenue was more than 86 billion yuan; 41 regions levied state -owned capital income from losing enterprises, levied first taxes and fees Or directly punish the fines, and organize the fiscal revenue of more than 7.7 billion yuan in violation of regulations; 55 regions of illegal or disguised taxes or land transfer funds, a total of more than 22.5 billion yuan. Secondly, the new hidden debt was added in violation of regulations. The audit found that 49 regions were repurchased by promised to repurchase and the construction of state -owned enterprises.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T05-54-00-04-00/000002.png" />The China Audit Office issued a work report that 70 regions have fallen by more than 86 billion yuan in fiscal revenue by "self -selling and buying" state -owned assets and fictional land transactions. (Information Picture of the Associated Press) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/gt2-06272023052319.html/ap511003680845.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T05-54-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Cai Shenkun said that next, the illegal phenomenon mentioned by the audit report will be traced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection: "The Audit Office opened the way in front, and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission took people behind. The problem does not appear now, including the misappropriation of funds, and the use of funds for other aspects has long -term existence, and it has not been resolved, because the black hole in the central government, especially the transfer payment, is very deep. "</p>
<p>The Audit Department also mentioned that there are problems with special bond management. Among them, 20 areas have fallen virtual project revenue and underestimated costs, etc., and "packaged" the project into a balance between the income and financing scale. The region invests about 5 billion yuan of funds to the prohibition of the landscape engineering and commercial projects; the 47 regions have misappropriated more than 15.7 billion yuan in violation of regulations; the expenditure progress of 33 special bond projects in 5 regions has fallen.</p>
<p><strong> Fiscal resources are exhausted Local government false reports </strong></p>
<p>Xu Quan, a doctor of philosophy of the City University of Hong Kong, said in an interview with this station that in the 1990s, after China implemented a tax -sharing system, the source of the government's financial sources began to rely on land auction revenue. Revenue has decreased year by year, and it is almost exhausted today. He said: "The biggest problem we see in the audit report is to increase local fiscal revenue. The most important reason why China's financial power is inconsistent with the right to affairs. The better the indicator, the higher the tax return. This will cause the local government to falsely report. "</p>
<p>Xu Quan believes that if China's economic growth is insufficient, and if real estate is stunned, the local government will face a fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>The audit report shows that since May 2022, the audit found and transferred more than 300 clues to major disciplinary violations, involving more than 1,800 people.</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang attended the "New Leaders' Annual Meeting" held by the World Economic Forum (WeF) on Tuesday (June 27). During the opening ceremony "<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国国家安全顾问对华关系要去风险-而非脱钩/a-65462184">Dependence, Risk Reduction</a>"The statement is pseudo -propositions, and oppose people to politicize economic trade issues.</p>
<p>Li Qiang said that the development of globalization has allowed countries to depend on each other and develop together, which is a good thing. If there is any risk of any industrial chain, it should not be calculated by a specific government or organization. related business. He therefore opposed people as the way of people, politicized economic and trade issues, and called on countries to maintain the stability and smoothness of global industries and supply chains, so that the results of economic development should benefit different countries and people in different countries and people.</p>
<p>In addition, Li Qiang also said that the Chinese economy's recovery trend this year is obvious. The economic growth rate of the second quarter is expected to be higher than the previous quarter.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中國經濟增長目標5偏保守-專家一定可達到/a-64888850)"". At that time, Li Qiang said that it was not easy to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>However, Reuters reports that after the industrial output and retail sales data in May did not meet the expectations, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/标普降中国经济预测-专家谈如何缓解就业难/a-66036410">multiple banks have repaired the expectations of China's GDP growth this year</a>It also said that Beijing must take further measures to support the country's economic recovery that is not as expected as expected after the country.</p>
<p>"New Leaders' Annual Meeting", also known as the "Summerdavos", is a meeting held by WEF each year in major cities in China. Participants are mostly emerging markets such as "BRICS countries" or among developed countries. Enterprise organizations, politicians, and experts and scholars. There are about 1,500 participants this year, including [New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, which has launched a visit to China on the 25th]](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/不跟隨拜登批中-新西蘭總理將率團訪華/a-66009563)Essence</p>
<h3>WTO Director -General: "Development" will damage the global economy</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement saying that before the opening of the opening lecture, Li Qiang had met with the World Trade Organization (WTO) director of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the afternoon of the 26th. And published similar conversations.</p>
<p>Li Qiang told Ivera that free trade and division of labor are an inevitable choice to deal with global challenges. Some countries have proposed "dependence" and "risks", which not only violates the principles of free trade advocated by the WTO. The multilateral trading system also violates the security and stability of economic laws and disrupts the global industrial chain supply chain, and eventually hinders the process of recovery of the world economy.</p>
<p>According to this statement, Ivera responded that the world economy should not be fragmented, and "decoupling" will damage global economic development, and unilateralism and protectionism also violate the trend of globalization. She said that WTO appreciates China's important contributions since the organization has joined the organization, and also looks forward to building a strong partnership with China.</p>

<h3>How can the West talk about "reducing risks"?</h3>
<p>The concept of "dependence and risk reduction" of some countries in Li Qiangkou has recently mentioned repeatedly in Europe and the United States, but it may not be the same as China's understanding of this.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Jakesullivan, a US national security consultant, said that the important prerequisite for economic globalization is the principle of compliance with responsibility and opening up. The key industries, and the continuous expansion of military ambitions in the Asia -Pacific region, have not discouraged Russia's invasion, have challenged a considerable challenge to international order. Therefore, the United States and its allies began to <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国会被美国的芯片制裁卡脖子吗/a-65925528">implement export restrictions on Chinese chip technology</a>, And <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/忧国家安全-美国禁售华为中兴设备/a-63900111">Banning of Huawei, Huawei, manufacturer of communication equipment</a>, To reduce dependence and risks to China's supply chain.</p>
<p>"Risk -de -risk means an effective supply chain with elasticity and ensure that we will not be coerced by any country." He emphasized that these measures are only aimed at "a few plans to challenge our country in military" without a needle. Other emerging economies are not "technical blockade" criticized by Beijing.</p>
<p>He said: "We just need to ensure that the technology of the United States and the allies will not be used to deal with ourselves, not to cut off trade." He also pointed out that bilateral trade between China and the United States hit a new record last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/歐盟談對中貿易去風險而非脫鉤/a-64445854">Chairman of the European Executive Committee Feng Delin</a>(Ursulavon Derleyen) also stated on WeF that although the EU needs to "cooperate with China and trade", it still needs to amend the direction of commercial transactions with China to seek "reducing risks, not decoupling" with the world's second largest economy in this world, Essence</p>

<p>People familiar with the matter said that the US Treasury Minister Yellen plans to visit Beijing in early July and hold the first senior economic talks with senior officials of the Chinese Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Yellen had expressed his hope to visit China within this year and meet with He Lifeng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Prime Minister of the State Council. He Lifeng, who has been in charge of China's economy and financial systems in March this year, is a friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Because Yellen's details of China have not been officially announced, the insiders are not required.</p>
<p>At the same time, those familiar with the internal reviewers of the White House revealed that the Bayeng government is about to formulate an administrative order. This administrative order aims to supervise and cut off some investment in the United States in China. The goal of the administrative department is to complete in late July.</p>
<p>If Yellen is determined, she will be the second member of the American Cabinet who visited China after the deterioration of US -China relations. U.S. Secretary of State Brills just ended his trip to Beijing on the 19th. During his two -day visit, he had a meeting with Xi Jinping, a member of the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang, and a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office. He also met with Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said on Monday (June 26) that whether Yellen had visited China has not been confirmed, and the presidential administrative order has not been finalized and the timetable has not been released.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T07-23-33/1-1687849541.jpg" />Israel approves the plan to build thousands</p>
<p>The Israeli Right -wing government has approved plans to build thousands of new houses on the west bank of the occupied Jordan River on the occupied Jordan River. Palestinian officials condemned this move as part of the "public war against the Palestinian people".</p>
<p>In the context of the increasing increase in violence in the occupied territory and the increasing criticism of the United States' policy on Israel's settlement, it has made the above decisions.</p>
<p>The National Defense Planning Committee, which is responsible for supervising the settlement of the settlement, approved more than 5,000 new settlements houses on Monday. These units are at different stages of planning. At present, it is unclear when the construction starts, and the Ministry of Defense Planning Committee has not commented immediately.</p>
<p>The international community and the Palestinian people believe that the construction of settlements is illegal, and it is a obstacle to peace. More than 700,000 Israelis live on the west bank of the occupied Jordan River and East Jerusalem -the territory occupied by Israel in 1967. The Palestinian seeks to establish the future s country.</p>
<p>Vessel Abu You Sufu, a Palestinian official on the west bank of the Jordan River, said, "The Government of the Neitanahu is engaged in aggression and public war on the Palestinian people," he added that "we stated that all the occupied Palestinian territories All settlers colonialism is illegal. "</p>
<p>The Israeli government, which came to power at the end of December, is led by religion and extreme nationalist politicians with close relationships with the settlement. The Minister of Finance Bezalelsmotrich is a instigating settleer leader. The policy power of the cabinet -level settlement site is awarded, and the population of the occupant of the occupied Jordan River has doubled.</p>
<p>Peninsula TV reporter, Emran Khan, reported on the settlement of the Jordan River on the west bank of the Jordan River, and reported that the news was "a huge victory of Belizale Smomric."</p>
<p>A reporter of the Peninsula TV stations added that "Generally, there are six stages of approval of the expansion of the settlement, including security considerations, the true builders of the settlement, and political considerations. They can express their concerns, but they often slow down. "</p>
<p>"But last week, the cabinet led by Prime Minister Benjamin Neitana completely simplified this process and transferred almost complete control to Smortic. Today, he has exercised this control power ","</p>
<p>Since the re -election in November, the Neitana government has regarded expansion settlements as the primary task.</p>
<p>Peninsula TV reporter Emran Khan said that illegal GIV’AT ZE’EV settlement has been approved to build 900 new buildings.</p>
<p>"This will make this more permanent than now," said the Peninsula TV reporter Emran Khan, "said," he also added. "If the two countries have reached a consensus, the place where I am standing should be Palestine. It is frustrated that these settlements are still being built. Since the 1980s, these activities have been carried out on the west bank of the Jordan River, which have been occupied. "</p>
<h4>Violent incident continues to increase</h4>
<p>Senior Israeli government officials have been promoting the increase in construction and other measures to consolidate Israel's control over territory, aiming to cope with the wave of violence for more than a year with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Last week, after the Israeli army attacked Jining Refugee Camp, at least seven Palestinians were killed and dozens of people were injured.</p>
<p>After the attack, the two Palestinian gunmen fired near the illegal Jewish settlement, causing four Israelis to be killed.</p>
<p>After a series of fatal attacks in Palestine, Israel expanded military activities on the west bank of the Jordan River in early 2022.</p>
<p>According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 174 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army and settlers since the beginning of this year, and about 24 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks.</p>
<p>In the Middle East War in 1967, Israel occupied the west bank of the Jordan, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians claimed that they had all these three territories to establish future independent countries.</p>
<p>The United Nations Palestinian issue special reporter Franciska Albunse told Peninsula TV that there is a "execution problem" in international law.</p>
<p>Albunse said, "There are double standards, because it is obvious that there are cognitive imbalances on the Palestinian issue, especially between Western countries, and remain silent in implementing compulsory measures and all prohibitions stipulated in international law."</p>
<p>The US President Joe Biden's government has increasingly criticized Israel's settlement policy.</p>
<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the latest decision of the Israeli administration "we are deeply disturbed."</p>
<p>Miller said, "We are just concerned about the changes in the changes in the Israeli settlement management system. These changes have accelerated the planning and approval of the settlement."</p>
<p>"We have directly expressed their concerns to the Israeli government about settlement and increasing the settlement unit. I suspect that they can find the appropriate impact."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Brillon said that these settlements were "the obstacles we seeks hope for hope."</p>
<p>Despite criticism, the United States has rarely taken any action on Israel. The White House has not invited Neitanahu to visit in accordance with the practice of Israel's elections, which shows its dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>This week, the United States stated that it would not transfer funds to Israeli institutions for the scientific and technological research projects on the west bank of the Jordan River, which was occupied. policy.</p>
<p>Before voting on Monday, Israel's Cabinet Minister and Right -wing Jewish Power Party member Isaac Vesharav faded the differences with the United States.</p>
<p>Isaac Vesharav told the Army Broadcasting Station, "I think I will continue to exist with the United States alliance," he added, "There are differences, we know how to deal with them in the past."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-27T07-52-09-00-00/000185722_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>On June 27, Dai Minhan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a professor at Xiamen University at the Tianjin Summer Davos Forum, spoke at the "Return to Natural Survival Controversy" sub -forum, saying that the most advanced information and manufacturing technology are still significant to the ocean. Insufficient cognition, financial leverage has not invested in the new economic growth pole.</p>
<p>To restore the global natural ecology, it is necessary to use the three aspects of continuing degradation, protection and repair. Academician Dai Minhan suggested that the coastal wetland is used as the entry point because it is the economic life pulse. According to its preliminary research, if China can curb the continued degradation of coastal wetland, it has the potential to restore the wetland ecosystem to the level of 30-40%in the 1980s. At the same time, it is necessary to use scientific repair based on ecosystems, not landscape repair. These suggestions are based on a formula made by Academician Dai Minhan:</p>
<p>Prosperous Ocean = (Scientific Cognitive+Technical Revolution+Scientific Governance+Blue Finance) × Common Design 2</p>
<p>Lu Minfang, CEO of Mengniu Group, also shared ecological reconstruction cases on the forum, that is, using local natural resources to plant pastures and grass fields, and planted 98 million trees in 10 years to fix the sand. It is expected that the scale of tree planting this year can reach 1 to 1 100 million. In the middle of the sand -fixed oasis, there are ranch and grass farms to raise cattle, and use cattle's feces to improve the land so that the land can grow corn, pumpkin, cucumber and other crops. Lu Minfang said, "This approach is very efficient in the short term, but I think it is good for the long -term ecological benefits." For example, the organic pure milk of the Telun Soviet desert has been recognized by consumers and is willing to pay for it for it. Premium.</p>
<p>The loss of natural changes, environmental pollution, and ecological diversity is the most severe and global challenge of human civilization. Academician Dai Minhan pointed out that this challenge will last at least 30-50 years. In addition, the Bezos Earth Foundation(Bezos Earth Fund)Vice Chairman Charlotte Pera also revealed to the FT Chinese website after the meeting that the foundation has a clear plan for the restoration of Amazon Rainforest.</p>

<p>Suspected sphere of balloon flew over Japan's satellite images.</p>
<p><strong> BBC "Panorama" column revealed the new evidence of the Chinese spy balloon plan, including its flight over Japan and Taiwan. </strong></p>
<p>Japan has confirmed that a balloon has flew over its territory and said it was ready to shoot it down in the future.</p>
<p>China does not respond directly to the evidence provided by the BBC.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a spy balls accused of being accused of China were shot down near the United States coast, causing Sino -US relations to fall into trouble.</p>
<p>China claims that the balloon seen on the northwest of the United States at the end of January is a civil airship and used for scientific research such as meteorology -and it is said that it is an unexpected individual incident.</p>
<p>Former East Asian analyst Johnculver, former East Asian analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, told the "Wide -angle Mirror" program that this is "not a single incident, but at least to dates back to continuous action five years ago." He said that China's balloon is "especially for this type of long -distance task", and some "seem to surround the earth."</p>

<p>In February 2023, the U.S. Navy personnel recovered the wreckage of suspected spy balloon in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64541104">Chinese balloon flying over the United States violates international law? </a>BBC cooperated with artificial intelligence company Synthetaic to find a large amount of data captured by satellites and found multiple balloon images through East Asia.</p>
<p>The company's founder Corey Jaskolski discovered evidence of a balloon crossing northern Japan in September 2021. These images have not been made public in the past.</p>
<p>Jascarski also believes that evidence shows that the balloon was launched from the inland inland south of Mongolia. BBC cannot verify this.</p>
<p>Japan is an intimate ally in the United States. There are more troops stationed in Japan than in any other country.</p>

<p>Suspected Chinese spy balls were photographed over Taiwan.</p>
<p>Murakami Murakami in the Japanese Ministry of Defense told the BBC that the Japanese government is "taking various planning measures to monitor the relevant situation daily" and even prepares to hit the balloon to protect the "life and property of the people in the Japanese territory."</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said that Chinese balloon equipment has the ability to collect signal information. It said that the aircraft found in the United States has "multiple antennas and is likely to be capable of collecting and positioning communication."</p>
<p>In order to investigate whether China has launched other balloons, the "Wide -angle Mirror" team first searched the witness report on unknown sky flights in social media and news reports in the region.</p>
<p>They found that two photos taken by the Taiwan weather department seemed to show a balloon flying over the capital Taipei at the end of September 2021.</p>
<p>Jascarski then cross -compares these photos with satellite images. "We found that the balloon flew out of the coastline of Taiwan within 90 seconds," he said.</p>

<h3>Is the Chinese government monitoring you?</h3>
<p>[Video-1-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-66028371/P0FXJ8Z5/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-66028371/p0fxj8z5/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-07-04.000Z/p0fxjc3p.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>The new image shows that Chinese spy balloon once flew over Japan and Taiwan</p>
<p>From a spy balloon to the secret police to the escape from the disgraceful, the Panorama investigation reported that China ’s global monitoring operation was reported. We revealed new details about the Beijing Spy Balloon Fleet, and also black into a Chinese -made monitoring camera, showing how similar devices on the streets can be used.</p>
<p>BBC Chinese will publish a complete video version of the report later, so stay tuned.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-07-04.000Z/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png" />The Taiwanese government told "Wide -angle Mirror" that they believe that it was a weather balloon, but Jascarski did not agree.</p>
<p>"Judging by the diameter of the balloon, and it seems similar to its operation height ... It is like the balloon flying over the United States and Japan," he said.</p>
<p>Taiwan, where the democratic government's main administration has long been the goal of China.</p>
<p>Last year, the Chinese army conducted a comprehensive offensive drill.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has stated that if China launch an offense, the United States will defend Taiwan.</p>
<h3>How to help positioning balloons in artificial intelligence?</h3>
<p>Kerry Jaskarski first imagined what the balloon seen from space can be drawn out. Then, he entered this outline to his AI software and joined the coordinates when he saw the ball ball for the last time.</p>
<p>He also joined the wind model analysis to track the path of balloons and find its starting point.</p>

<p>Kerry Jaskarski</p>
<p>With the satellite image provided by Planet Labs (Planet Labs), Kobe enters all information to his software RAIC (fast automatic image classification) to position balloon.However, they look just small white spots from the satellite shooting from the space.</p>
<p>Research from Justarki showed that the balloon flying over the United States in February was only 80 miles (130 kilometers) of a nuclear air force base in Mongolia.</p>
<p>He also retreated the flying path back to its most likely launch location -Hainan Island in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>"It seems ... there is a cloud layer at the launch location," he said. "If I want to launch a balloon, I will choose a cloudy day to minimize the detected opportunity."</p>

<p>Jascarsky tracks balloons through such satellite images.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London has accused the United States that it has released a large number of high -altitude balloon, continuing to surround the earth, and illegally fly over China.</p>
<p>The embassy also said that "China is a responsible country", always "strictly abide by international law and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries." It also added to refuse to "discredit and attack China for unjustly."</p>

<h3>to save local birds New Zealand decided to eliminate mice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Henri Astier * BBC reporter, from New Zealand</li>
</ul>
<p>8:15 am on June 27, 2023![] <a href="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129945913_mediaitem129083893.jpg"></a>Image adding text,</p>
<p>Some islands in New Zealand are open to the public, but rodents are rejected.</p>
<p><strong> On a sunny Sunday morning, wild animal lovers gathered on the beautiful Miramar Peninsula. They are performing an extinction task. </strong></p>
<p>The "Predator-Free Miramar" organization is committed to protecting birds in the New Zealand capital Wellington, and their way is to eliminate mice-eradicate each mouse.</p>
<p>After wearing a reflective jacket, the volunteers got poison and peanut butter, which is the ideal bait of rodents.</p>
<p>Everyone is assigned to a area where they will check the spring trap and bait boxes with toxins. "Bads, I wish you a good luck." Said Dan Coup, the person in charge of the group.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129175978_mediaitem129083500.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>The task of Mirama volunteers is to eliminate the last few mice left on the peninsula.</p>
<p>A GPS application guides Kupu through the bush and finds the equipment on the route. Everywhere, he replaced the bait and updated the information on the application. No signs have shown that a mouse has come.</p>
<p>But when he was looking for feces and other clues on the ground, his phone shook. A participant posted a picture in their WhatsApp group: a mouse who died in a trap.</p>
<p>This is not a popular news. "Dave would be happy because he grabbed the mouse, but we felt sad because there was a mouse." Kupu sighed.</p>
<p>The elimination of mice and other predators is not only the goal of Mirama, but also the goal of New Zealand. The government expects this task by 2050.</p>
<p>This is a difficult task. The largest area that has destroyed all mice is South Georgia, which is an island of 170 kilometers (105 miles) on the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>New Zealand natural conservatives believe that at the right time, this can be achieved in a larger region in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Others pointed out actual and moral issues.</p>
<p>The core of this project is a unique ecological environment. New Zealand was split from an ancient oversized mainland 85 million years ago, far before the appearance of mammals. Without predators on land, birds can build nests or not fly on the ground.</p>

<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>New Zealand countries symbolize several dimensions of birds have been threatened for a long time, and few young birds can survive without controlling predators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/fooc-46457885">Paris: Romantic City Rat disasters caused a dispute between mice and mice</a><em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/fooc-58690769">Confront the Paris Mouse positively</a></em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science-51473952">Wildlife Photography Contest: Metro Mouse won the Popular Award for Food</a>* <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/science/2015/02/150224_rat_black_death">Research: Mouse "is not the question of sin that causes the outbreak of the black death"</a>In addition, New Zealand is the last main land for human settlement. In the 13th century, Poluniians brought mice and Pacific rats. Sixth century later, Europeans introduced larger mammals, eating birds with no defense capabilities. Since the settlement of humans, almost one -third of local species have been extinct.</p>
<p>It is not a new thing to save other species. In the 1960s, the nurses managed to clear the mice on the offshore island. But it was not until around 2010 that dealing with predators became a social phenomenon.</p>
<p>James Russell, a biologist at the University of Auckland, and the proposter of the 2050 plan, said: "It comes out and becomes a totem of a country."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_130213746_map.jpg" />Russell said one of the factor is the appearance of infrared cameras. In the 20th century, the most obvious pests and the main targets were large herbivores, such as deer and goats. But since the beginning of this century, wild animal enthusiasts have been able to show the activities of small mammals at night.</p>
<p>The pictures of mice rushed to eggs and chicks were widely shared. "This video stimulated people." At that time, an ecologist estimated that 26 million birds were eaten by predators in New Zealand each year.</p>
<p>In 2011, the famous physicist Sir Paulcallaghan promoted the dream of a country without predators. Russell and other young environmentalists believe that as long as they have enough investment and mobilization, they can do this.</p>
<p>Politicians also joined. In 2016, a law listed the predators most needed to eliminate: three kinds of mice (Pacific Rats, Ship, Norwegian Rats), Itachi Rats (White and Weasel, Ferry) and negative mice. In the middle of this century, it was set as the last deadline for completing the task.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129994414_gettyimages-978391140.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>The Norwegian rats boarded European ships at the end of the 18th century and quickly spread to New Zealand.</p>
<p>"Predator Free 2050 LTD" is a public institution. It is established to introduce government and private funds into local projects to test the root era strategy.</p>
<p>Among them, the most ambitious is the "Predator Freewelllington". In a city with a population of 200,000, its goal is to eliminate a series of harmful animals, especially mice breeding in the urban environment.A camera is also installed in hot areas. "If any mouse appears, my planned team knows where they need to use resources." Said Jameswillcox, the head of the predatory organization.</p>
<p>Each mouse found to be found was sent to the laboratory for autopsy. This is important because anticoagulants will slowly kill the target in design. Mouse is a smart social animal, and they will learn to avoid those things that obviously hurt them.</p>
<p>When a poisonous mouse died away from the bait box, Wellington had no predator tissue to perform autopsy to monitor the effect.</p>
<p>"We cut them and see if they were killed by toxins." Wil curds explained. "We still need to understand whether it is male or female. Have we been breeding recently? Are we hunting a mouse or a group of mice?"</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129173711_mediaitem129173710.jpg" />Image source, getty images</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>In New Zealand, Tuy Bird's cry can only be heard in the ringtone of the phone in most cases. Now this sound is everywhere.</p>
<p>Mirama has always been the forefront of the city against predators. Today, mice are rare on this peninsula, and many local birds are back. In Wellington, the number of Tuy Bird was reduced to only a few pairs in 1990, but now their unique calls are everywhere.</p>
<p>"In our back garden, Tuy Bird has always been flying." Paul Hay, who had lived in Milama for a long time, said. "Birds are absolutely rapidly reproduced, especially in the past five years."</p>
<p>The efforts of the city are beneficial to the early conservation concepts created by Wellington: anti -predator fence.</p>
<p>In 1999, the world's first urban ecological reserves were open to a miles away from the city center. It is now known as Zealandia and is protected by 8 kilometers long fence. Tourists' luggage must be checked and must pass a double -door barrier similar to air gates.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129082726_zealandiaentrance3.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>The Tiss Dia Ecological Reserve attaches great importance to biological safety.</p>
<p>Behind such strict biological safety measures, the rare birds have not only survived, but also spread to the nearby community.</p>
<p>Now there are dozens of fence -type protected areas throughout New Zealand. The biggest is Brook, covering nearly 700 hectares, three times larger than Diabora Dia, Nelson on the South Island.</p>
<p>One year after the predator fence was erected in 2016, the harmful species in the region were completely cleared. The current challenge is to ensure that there are no new harmful species entering.</p>
<p>Maintaining vigilant at all times. A mouse may be unexpectedly in it by a rapto; a tree may overwhelm the fence and let the weasel go in.</p>
<p>Any damage to the fence will trigger its alarm system. Nick Robson, the operating manager of Brook, said: "If the alarm sounds in the middle of the night, one of us will go and see."</p>
<p>The camera reminds staff to pay attention to any invasion. But the final detection tool and the biggest enemy of predators are the best friends of human beings. "After special training, the dog can find some harmful species and ignore other species." Robson said. "It may be that dogs can detect mice, but our equipment cannot."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129148246_mediaitem129148245.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>The Brook Reserve can rely on Macca and Elmo to smell predator.</p>
<p>Preventing harmful species from invasion is a matter worthy of attention, especially for offshore islands. Rakura Island (Stuart Island) is the largest island, which is 25 kilometers away from mainland New Zealand. Although there are mice on the island, there are no Itachi rats. This relatively isolated environment allows rare birds to build nests here, and conservatives are trying to protect it.</p>
<p>Detective dog "Gadget" is a "net red" dog. She has her own Facebook page: You can follow her, because she will check whether the immigrant ships carry rodents to smuggle passengers.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the volunteer organization "Stuart Island/Rakilla Community and Environmental Trust Fund" (Sircet, "community and environmental trust") has been preventing mouse and other harmful species from destroying the gray inhabitation. Gray is a species built on the ground, which has almost disappeared on the mainland.</p>
<p>"We are sticking to the line of defense." Shona Sangster, the chairman of the volunteer organization, said when checking the trap in the bushes.</p>
<p>For offshore islands that have no predators, strong defense measures are essential. Because mice can swim for half miles (800 meters), it is a long -term struggle for them to stay away from these protected areas and endangered birds they shelter.</p>
<p>Government funds have played a helping role. According to the "Predator Frerakiura" project established in 2050, it provides tools such as professional knowledge, paid services and exquisite automatic reset traps. They can shatter the skull of any nearby mouse, and they need to be rarely maintained -dead mice will fall to the ground, and nature will clean up.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129175261_mediaitem129083493.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>The automatic reset trap is very suitable for remote protected areas that cannot be checked regularly.</p>
<p>The budget of "Rakilla's non -predator" is far less than Wellington's peers, but local nurses enjoy the popularity of people's dreams in other parts of the country. Community and environmental trust stated that from 2020 to 2021, 261 people paid time for the cause. For an island with only 440 residents, this is a huge mobilization rate.</p>
<p>Last year, the organization issued a mouse catcher to the primary school students and awarded prizes for children with the most, the largest, maximum tooth, and the thicker fur.</p>
<p>Saster said that these young people grew up in a community that attaches great importance to predators. "From the perspective of outsiders, a little unusual thing is part of their daily life."</p>
<p>Community and environmental trusts also advocate responsible pets on the island. Cats are also bird killers, but they are exempted from being destroyed because they are regarded as pets, but they must be sterilized and implanted in micro chips.</p>
<p>Dogs often mistaken for a few vitamin (ostrich) as furry toys, which may also be dangerous. In a training plan provided by the community and environmental trust, a few electronic birds will make slight electric shocks on too friendly dogs and teach them to keep their distance.The feasibility of the entire 2050 plan has always been controversial among environmentalists. James Lynch, the founder of Jereal, has reserved opinions on practicality and cost benefits.</p>
<p>He supports the ultimate goal of eliminating predators. "The problem is that we don't have this toolbox at present." Lin Qi said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that most native birds do not need the environment of zero predators to grow up. He believes that a small number of birds needed can survive on outlying islands or urban reserves. Lin Qi suggested not to try to clear the harmful species of the entire country, but focus on the forest land around the fence to maximize the survival rate of the flying birds.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129149644_mediaitem129149643.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>Many birds built nests on the side of the Dia -free fence (left), and then flew to the surrounding forests (right).</p>
<p>He said that while developing a thorough elimination of harmful species tools, this concept played a role in Wellington and represents the biggest expectations of the country.</p>
<p>Other people believe that New Zealand, which has no predator at all, is whimsical. Conservation researcher Waynelinklater pointed out that in the past 150 years, every battle launched by New Zealand on rabbits, deer and other harmful species ended in failure.</p>
<p>Links added that the movement of eliminating creative and perceive creatures is not only unreasonable, but also morally wrong. "We mobilized a lot of resources and the enthusiasm of the people, but we implemented extremely cruel behaviors. How can we be so lightly written about pain?"</p>
<p>Clearing the action of social evil forces, large -scale mobilization and slogans reminded Linklet with religious fanaticism. He said that the non -predator movement "depends on the demonization of a species and fights with the species so that you can kill it."</p>
<p>In addition, humans, the most aggressive mammalian predator and systemic destroyer of the habitat, what qualifications to comprehensively declare war on it?</p>
<p>Links suggested that instead of setting the national goals that cannot be achieved, it is better to let the community determine the goal of its own biodiversity. Auckland residents can tolerate some mice and negative mice, while residents on Stuart is may prioritize their vitamin birds and gray.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-27T08-15-28.000Z/_129174773_mediaitem129174772.jpg" />Image adding text,</p>
<p>The islands near Rakilla are protected by traps and poisons, so as not to be invaded again.</p>
<p>However, Jamesrussell, a biologist who provided a large number of scientific support for 2050, believes that the localization strategy is meaningless. He shrugged and said, "This is a model without ambition and everything."</p>
<p>He continued to say that some places were wrong to save birds: it needs permanent investment to prevent predators from returning. It is expensive to completely eradicate, but "you pay once and then finish."</p>
<p>Russell admits that no one knows how to complete this work yet. But since the 1960s, the prevention and control technology of harmful species has made great progress. Therefore, who knows what kind of results can the continuous investment achieve in the next 27 years?</p>
<p>As for moral opposition, there is no fixed answer. This depends on how individuals and society weigh the complex arguments. Russell said the New Zealanders collectively decided to sacrifice some species to save other species correct.</p>
<p>Indeed, now the sound of opposition to eradication has weakened, and people are enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Back to the Mirama Peninsula, Dan Kupu looked forward to the day when he and his mouse catcher could finally retire.</p>
<p>"You have a choice, either work forever, or you make a big investment in advance, grab the last 0.5%mouse, and then you don't need to work anymore." He said.</p>

<p>Porigen's private army was excluded out of the game. His rich government catering contract was threatened. His most admired commander in the Russian army was lifted his position on the Supreme Commander of the Ukraine. He also lost the most important channel for recruitment -Russian prison.</p>
<p>His only hope was to intervene at the last moment, and he was unable to defeat in the long -term power struggle with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu. This hopes were shattered on June 13.</p>
<p>Putin openly stands on the opponent's opponent, insisting that all the informal troops fighting in Ukraine must sign contracts with the Ministry of Defense. These include Vigner, a private military company in Pleigo.</p>
<p>Now, the mercenary leader will be ordered to be ordered in Shaygugo, a person with an unparalleled political life in modern Russia, and is also a dead enemy of Perigo.</p>

<p>"You have to do this," Putin said in the same group of warfareers in the Kremlin palace. "This matter must be completed as soon as possible."</p>
<p>What happened next shocked the world: Pricig launched an armed rebellion. He insisted that the purpose of this rebellion was not to overthrow Putin, but to overthrow the military leadership of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Although this mutiny is short -lived, it is widely regarded as an ominous political sign of Putin's leadership. As the Russian president continued to advance a high price war, this mutiny may indicate more unstable.</p>
<p>But it is also a personal story. It tells a "self -employed" warlord that is not convinced and repeated to make an emotional final attempt to try to win one of the most unusual power struggles in Russia through force to win Russia. Essence</p>
<p>In the 23 years when Putin has served as Russian leaders, many powerful Russian characters have defeated in faction struggle, and eventually ended in exile, prison or forgotten.</p>
<p>However, in the weekend rebellion, Pryigo chose a different path to show his pain and anger in front of the world. The action he took was that only one person had a loudspeaker that could broadcast to the country- And a well -equipped and indignant private army -it can be done.</p>
<p>"The rebellion of Pryigo is not for seizing power, nor to overthrow the Kremlin," Takanana Stannovaia, a senior researcher at the Eurasian Center of Cuniki Russia, wrote in the analysis of the incident. "It stems from a sense of despair; Pryigo was forced to leave Ukraine. He found that he could not maintain Wagner as before, and the state machine was starting to target him."</p>
<p>"The worst is," she added, "Putin ignored him, and publicly supported his most dangerous opponent."</p>
<p>Porigen established a huge financial and military empire. However, as his political resistance became stronger and stronger, the flow of funds from the Ministry of National Defense and other government contracts faced the risk of exhaustion. He was annoyed to think of being incompetent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Steinnova wrote that when Putin condemned his behavior on Saturday, Pleigo seemed to be caught off guard, not ready to be a revolutionaries, and was not ready to continue to enter the Kremlin Palace to enter the palace. He realized that it would almost end in failure.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Pritigon had the opportunity to end the crisis through withdrawal, he seized the opportunity.</p>
<p>"In the final analysis, Pryo's rebellion is a risk of being forced to enter the desperate person," said Michael Cofman, the Russian research director of the Virginia Research Organization CNA. "With his fierce disputes intensified, his choice is getting less and less."</p>
<p>For many years, Pleigo has obtained a large profit contract with the relationship with Putin and the Kremlin, providing food for the Moscow school system and Russian military bases, and accumulated huge wealth. At the same time, he was engaged in the foreign adventure of the Kremlin through Wagner, and the goal of promoting Moscow in the Middle East and Africa -and his own goals, his soldiers were accused of killing in these areas and committed atrocities.</p>
<p>He also manages the infamous St. Petersburg Internet Giant Farm(troll farm)"Internet Research Agency", the latter interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.</p>

<p>Porigon is as much as his activities, so that he has long denied any relationship with Wagner, and even sued the Russian media that he had a relationship with the organization.In September, Pricigen was the first time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/world/europe/russia-wagner-group-prigozhin.html">public</a>He was the identity of the leader behind Wagner.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks later, Putin appointed General Sergei Surovin to lead the Ukrainian war, which is a gospel for the leader of Wagner. He has worked with the general in Syria. Porigen described this new leader as a legend and the most capable commander in the Russian army.</p>
<p>Parig's status is also constantly improving, because his soldiers have made progress in the long -lasting battle of Bachurut, Ukrainian city, but the Russian army has almost no performance. Russian commentators reported a large number of positive reports on the mercenary organization, and a glass tower in St. Petersburg was renamed "Wagner Center". There are recruitment posters from all over the country.</p>
<p>But by the beginning of this year, Pryigo's opponent in the Ministry of National Defense began to re -establish his power.</p>

<p>In January, Putin appointed General Waleri Vlasimov to replace General Surovin as the highest commander in Ukraine. Porigon often degraded Grassimov in Telegram audio news, implying that he was a office official, and he couldn't breathe with ordinary soldiers with bureaucracy.</p>
<p>According to the memoirs published by two Wagner veterans, this hostile seems to be traced back to Moscow's intervention in the Syrian civil war. At that time, Wagner and Ordinary Russian soldiers sometimes conflicted when competing for resources and loot. Last year, Pryigon had publicly talked about Syria's tension.</p>
<p>In February of this year, Perigon admitted that he had been cut off for his entry into Russian prison to recruit recruits. The Ministry of National Defense later began to follow the strategy of Porigan, where the prisoners were recruited.</p>

<p>The Russian military bloggers have hinted that the Russian military bloggers have long hinted that they have been completely publicized. By the end of February, Pricigen had publicly accused General Shoshgou and General Grassimov in the rebellion, saying that they deliberately refused to provide ammunition and supplies, which was intended to collapse the Wagner Group.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/world/europe/russia-intelligence-leaks.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">Leaked information file</a>It shows that at the end of February, Putin tried to convene Pleigor Ren and the Haguku meeting to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>But hostile continues to upgrade. According to Ukraine and Western officials, Wagner was forced to rely on a limited number of veterans to continue fighting in Bachomut due to the failure to recruit prisoners.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-27T08-27-09-08-00/26prigozhin-reconstruct-10-ptjf-master1050.jpg" />On Saturday, Porigo was on Rostov on the River on the River. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters</p>
<p>Pryigo, who was isolated from the core of Moscow's power, is increasingly asking for his public opinion position: social media. He began to shout directly to the Russian people, and the information he conveyed became more politicized. He began to publicly criticize that in a country that prohibit the discredit army, few people dare to do so.</p>
<p>Over time, he has gradually become frequent anger at the sour ridicule of Russia.</p>
<p>"What are you doing with bad stinking bastards? A group of pigs!" He said in a recording at the end of May. "Get out your office, your position was originally to protect the country."</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>He also violently criticized the Russian defense leader, saying that they were "full of expensive moisturizing creams on the huge buttocks that lived in a high position", and also said that the Russian people had the right to question. He made the bloody photos of Wagner's soldiers in the world. He issued an ultimatum to ask Wagner to evacuate Bachmut. He even mentioned a "old man" that might be a "big stupid". Although he did not name it, it was widely regarded as a attack on Putin.</p>
<p>What was confused about the experts of the Kremlin Palace was why Putin did not sweep the Wagner's head out of the floor or control him; some analysts believe that Putinle is fighting between different factions. Master too much power. Others doubt whether the Russian leader cannot solve the problem because he is too close to hearing, or just because his control is not as great as that point.</p>
<p>Porigen's troops occupied Bachmart at the end of May and soon withdrew from the battlefield, accusing the Russian army of setting up land mines on their usual retreat routes, and arrested a Lieutenant Colonel of the Russian army when they evacuated. All this makes Perigon more vulnerable. Russia no longer needs Wagner to play this war that has been rendered by domestic media.</p>
<p>By June, his isolation situation was obvious.</p>
<p>Porigen hinted that he and the Ministry of Defense had different divergent issues on the issue of serving in the army. For more than ten years, these contracts helped him accumulate a lot of wealth and influence. In a public letter to the Sakhag in a date to the June 6th, Pleigo said that since 2006, the total value of food he supplied to Russian military bases and institutions has been 147 billion rubles (about 1.74 billion U.S. dollars in $ 1.74 billion ), This number cannot be verified. Now he complains that "senior people" tries to force him to accept companies that are related to them as suppliers. He also said that a new system composed of "confidate suppliers" threatened his cost structure and may harm his business reputation.</p>
<p>His despair seems to be increasing day by day.</p>
<p>On June 10, a deputy of Shaygu announced that all troops who did not formally formulate internal operations in the Russian army must sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense before July 1.In a video released on June 16, he made a "contract" to the Russian Ministry of Defense in Moscow, but a receiver in the closed compartment closed the window in front of him.</p>
<p>A few days before he took the lead in the rebellion on Saturday, Perigo Ren revealed his mood, saying that the Russian army's stubborn illness could not be resolved at all. He also talked about the rise of the nation, saying that Shaoyu was executed and hinted that the people who lost their relatives in the war would revenge incompetent bureaucrats.</p>
<p>"When the time is mature, their mother, wife, and children will swallow these lives," he said in a video interview on June 6, suggesting that "civil changes" may occur.</p>
<p>He also said, "I can tell you the truth, I believe that as long as two or three months, the limit of these people is coming."</p>

<p>How to understand the current situation in the UK? According to the reason, the British economy is experiencing the drama of the "crisis of life costs", but consumer demand is still full of toughness, forcing the Bank of England(BoE)In order to reduce the stubborn inflation, it raised interest rates 13 times in a row.</p>
<p>It's not that no one is suffering. The relief grain issued by food banks surged. Facing the highest theft rate in the past 10 years, the owner of the store began to post anti -pimage signing on steak, butter and cheese. However, despite high inflation and tightening monetary policy, it seems that many people still have the willingness and ability to continue to spend money to buy goods and services. The official data recently showed that the prices of air tickets, vacation packages and on -site music festivals rose sharply. Retail sales from April to May increased by 0.3%, which was different from the decline in economists' expectations by 0.2%. How is this going?</p>

<h4>15. As the altar of Yonghe Palace and Huang Temple (below)</h4>
<p>Google can tell us more information about Huang Temple. For example, the earliest can be traced back to the Emperor Manchun Shunzhi invited the Dalai Lama 5 to meet in Beijing. To this end, the establishment of a Buddhist temple created during this Liaoning and Jin dynasties was rebuilt. The "Xihuang Temple of the heterogeneity, the style of the Middle Earth Temple, is collectively referred to as the Huang Temple, which is located in the north of the school farm outside De Shengmen.</p>
<p>In March 1652, the Fifth Dalai Lama led three thousand guards to set off from the Lhasa Zhelong Temple. It arrived in Beijing for five months in December. Donghuang Temple and Xihuang Temple were the place where the His Holiness was in tin. Among them, the residence of Xihuang Temple is also known as the "Dalai Lama". In 1780, the Sixth Panchen Lama was invited to wish Emperor Qianlong for two months in Beijing. It was the "Dalai Lou" who lived in Xihuang Temple. The emperor was commemorative on the west side of the tower. By the time Emperor Guangxu, the 13th Dalai Lama invaded Tibet because of the British invading Tibet. First, he went to Mongolia refuge, and then visited Beijing in September 1908 to seek help. After two months, he left Beijing. He has lived and held a law meeting many times in Xhuang Temple. He was worshiped by a large number of Buddhists from all ethnic groups. He also met the envoys and politicians who visited the visiting countries.</p>
<p>Because of these history, especially from the grand construction and worship of the Emperor Manchu Emperor, and the worship and passing of the Supreme Leaders and Monks of Tibetan Buddhism, which was welcomed to the Emperor's capital, left such an old saying in Beijing: "East The temple of the Huang Temple, the tower of the West Huang Temple ", admires the glory of the building. "After the completion of Shuanghuang Temple, it has received many monks from Tibet many times. In addition to the arrival of the Dalai VI and the Sixth Channel, for the Mongolian and Tibetan people who have already converted to the Huangjiao Political influence. Since then, the Mongolian nobles and Tibetan monks who come to Beijing will almost go to Shuanghuang Temple to worship and live in Donghuang Temple. "[1]</p>
<p>The years are replaced, and in the period of the People's Republic of China established by the Communist Party of China, according to Wikipedia Chinese Encyclopedia, "in 1958, all the buildings of Donghuang Temple and the Dalai Lama Temple of Xhuang Temple were demolished because of the breakdown." "Broken", who was dismantled and how to disassemble. There are new discoveries in the search network. Chinese official media such as Beijing Daily and Chinanews.com have always claimed that "Beijing Donghuang Temple ... either destroyed the invasion of the Eight -Power Allied Forces." However, there are many old photos about Donghuang Temple. The shot, the filmed in 1909, in 1920, in 1922, in 1928, and the 1930s, the 1940 Photographer and Japanese photographer shot. It can be seen from the photos that the Buddhist temples of Donghuang Temple are magnificent and complete, a tall and complete Buddha statue, and there is no signs of being destroyed. I remember the old things that the Eight -Power Allied Forces invaded in 1900. So the question is, who is the removal of Donghuang Temple?</p>
<p>According to netizens on Twitter, after 1949, Donghuang Temple belonged to the Central Military Commission, and so far there are still institutions such as the General Political Department, General Staff, and General Equipment Department. Some Beijingers wrote [2] said, "When it comes to the Huang Temple of Drum Tower and the Daedan Gate, many people first think of were not the Lama Temple, but the General Political House. There is an article [3] wrote: "Peiping reached a peaceful liberation agreement in early 1949", the Chinese army entered the city and scrambled to meet the "house", occupied the local, and "demolished the civil house". Several units inside were there. "However, in 1960, the Beijing Military Region moved out of Huang Temple and moved to Xishan Courtyard.It is also said that Donghuang Temple was demolished because of its geographical location. It is very important on the extension of the central axis or the north of the north of Beijing.</p>
<p>The article quoted earlier also wrote: "There is an old saying in Beijing: 'Temple of Donghuang Temple, the tower of Xiyong Temple.' But now I can see Xihuang Temple, but Donghuang Temple is gone ... ... Both temples are Lama Temple , The temple is overlapping, and the tiles are all yellow, because there is the name of the yellow temple. Unfortunately, Donghuang Temple was obliterated in the stormy waves of historical changes. "[6]" ... Some people said before, Donghuang Temple was destroyed by the destroyed by Donghuang Temple. The Eight Kingdoms Allied Forces, this is wrong. The preservation of Gujian was quite good. Some people said that it was destroyed by the Japanese during the War of Resistance Against Japan, which was also not precise, because the Japanese had a "Shuanghuang Temple" photo in the 1943 air camera, showing that Shuanghuang Temple was relatively complete. Moreover The Japanese have always worshiped the traditional culture and ancient buildings of China. German photographer Heida Molfa took many photos of Beijing Shuanghuang Temple in the 1930s and 1940s. These photos reflect most of the buildings of Shuanghuang Temple at the time. Well preserved. Most of the exquisite ancient buildings in China are destroyed in our own hands. "[7]</p>
<p>Many articles were disclosed throughout China. During the Cultural Revolution, it was also devastated. "In the era of large steel refining, many Buddha statues in the country, especially in the north, were transported to Shenyang, which was transported to heavy industrial bases," "The value of the Buddha statue burned when the steel refining steel was burned" ... The official report announced: "Since 1958, a total of 22,000 square meters of houses in 426 temples have been sent out to be used to use factories, agencies, schools and other units; 5,381 general metal cultural relics are treated, with a weight of about 500 tons and supporting industries. It is a summary of Beijing's cultural relics work since January 23, 1962 on the "Great Leap Forward". "[8] So the huge metal Buddha statues of Donghuang Temple, countless metal Buddhas, etc. What is the fate? How is it "handled"? Is it "big steel"? And many clay sculptures and stone carvings have been pushed down and built another new house?</p>
<p>In short, after the construction of the socialist revolution in 1958, Donghuang Temple disappeared, and it has become the "Huang Temple General Political Courtyard" that Beijing people always talk about. Xihuang Temple "only the Purissolian City Tower and the Purision City Tower Institute" were almost demolished in the Cultural Revolution. By the time "September 1, 1987, the Chinese Tibetan Senior Buddhist Academy was officially established at the Purissolic City Tower Institute in Xhuang Temple. Panchen Lama's residence is managed by the Communist Party of China. "[9]. In addition to the previously written, Xhuang Temple is also set as "Xihuang Temple Museum", which is separated from the Buddhist Academy. The museum is opened on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>The dramatic thing is that on the Internet, the information appearing with Huang Temple is "Huang Temple Burning", and the introduction of Beijing snack Beijing old name, but I am interested in me. After all, we still need real human fireworks like food. Consolation. Unfortunately, the epidemic that has been invincible to attack has been reunited, and I had to cancel the visit to the West Huang Temple and taste the "yellow temple braised". However, there is no need to be tangled. For a long time in various epidemics, I can accept all kinds of abnormal conditions. At the same time, I have prepared to find the crescent plateau after being "liberated" after being "liberated" after being "liberated" after being "liberated". Waiting patiently to go home.

<p>On Monday, the 26th, the army and the rapid support forces continued to conflict in the capital Khatoum. After aiming at the headquarters of the Central Police Reserve, the army bombed the position of the fast support forces.</p>
<p>According to a reporter from this report, the Sudan Air Force launched an attack on the positions of the rapid support forces north of Khamoum, Endaman and Khamoum.</p>
<p>As the fighter flew south of Endaman and fired a high-firing cannonball, the AL-GHABA region, south of northern Khamoum, and the west of Ensumman rose west of the AL-GHABA region, northern Kagole.</p>
<p>The rapid support forces commander Mohammed Hamdan (Hermeity) announced a unilateral ceasefire in the recording for two days. He also said that the ceasefire will take effect on the first day of the Alafri and Gulbang Festival.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hermeity also announced the establishment of a committee to investigate the responsibility of supporting personnel suspected of infringement of human rights and stated that he opposed any violations against civilians.</p>
<h4>The scope of combat expansion</h4>
<p>At the same time, the scope of Sudan's battle was significantly expanded, and the "Sudan People's Liberation Movement (Northern Bureau)" led by Abdul Aziz Hiru attacked the Sudan army resident in Green Nile.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T08-53-44/2-1687855656.jpg" />Sudan: North Coldo Fanzhou, South Cooper Fan and West Cordo Fanzhou(Peninsula TV Station)Two insiders at the Office of Malik Agel, Vice Chairman of the Sudan Movement Committee and the Sudan Sovereign Commission, told the Peninsula TV that the "Sudan People's Liberation Movement (Northern Bureau)" led by Abdul Aziz Hiru " For the first time, KHOR Al-Budi and Dima Mansour's multiple Sudan army bases south of Kurmuk were attacked.</p>
<p>The two sources added that the Sudan army responded to the attack and stated that the "Sudan People's Liberation Movement" continued to bombard the state.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Sudan army and the "Sudan People's Liberation Movement" signed a ceasefire agreement, which has been valid until the current conflict broke out in mid -April.</p>
<p>In the first comments of the Sudan conflict line map of the African -African countries (Igat), the African Peace and Security Council announced the full support of Igart's plan for Sudan conflict.</p>
<p>The council praised Igart's efforts and stated that it immediately stated that it immediately stopped hostile operation by the capital Kagoumum non -militaryization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a informed Sudan diplomatic source said in an interview with the Peninsula TV station that as he said, the support of the AU Peace and Security Council on the 26th was a leap in the dark International officials attempts to use the African Union to serve foreign agenda.</p>
<p>The source added that in the words of Sudan diplomats, "Sudan, as a country, leadership, army, and free people, has self -determination, does not expect anyone to obtain the guidance of anyone, nor will they be interfered in their internal affairs. Responsible adventure is scared down. "</p>
<p>On the other hand, Acyl Alman, a spokesman for the Central Committee of Freedom and Reform, said that as he said, the ceasefire between military personnel did not stop war and did not reduce the pain of civilians.</p>
<p>Alman added in a tweet on Twitter that the dialogue between military personnel could not bring results. He called on civil democratic forces to sit on the negotiating table and formulate a new path.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the battle in mid -April, about 3,000 people have died, thousands of people were injured, and hundreds of thousands of people fled to Sudan and some neighboring countries.</p>

<p>The World Meteorological Organization warned that in the next 5 years, the world's temperature may increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (about 2.7) for the first time than industrialization.</p>
<p>Although the weather events predicted by the United Nations Meteorological Institution have captured the abnormal temperature peak, they are an ominous sign, which means that the world will realize the hopes of limiting the average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.</p>
<p>However, the warning signal has existed for a while and is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>Barbecue is no longer the only smoke logo in early summer. The devastating wildfire is just like the raging wildfire of Canada earlier this month, indicating that the temperature rises frequently. At the same time, a cyclone like Bipgioy, who attacked in western India in mid -June, is seriously damaging at a increasing frequency.</p>
<p>According to the data provided by the independent research platform "Climate Action", after the eight years after the global leaders gathered in the suburbs of northeastern Paris, none of the countries can achieve the global temperature rise after 8 years. Limit the emission reduction target required at 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>So, is it all destined to fail? Or do we still have hope? Is there any country that has done better than other countries than other countries to ease the worst impact of climate change on future generations? If the answer is yes, what do they do right?</p>
<p><strong> In short, </strong>: Most developed countries are far behind their climate commitment. However, some developing countries such as Gambia, Costa Rica, Morocco, and Mali are taking bold measures to deal with the crisis -although the crisis is not caused by them, it often causes the most serious blow to them.</p>
<p>They are using solar energy for agricultural innovation and set an example for other countries. However, their journey also reveals the limitations of the battle alone in the northern country without really standing forward.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T09-24-51/AP22125440883775-1687830764-1687857176.jpg" />On September 26, 2021, Mangroves of the River in the Sales Kunda Gambia. From 1988 to 2018, the coverage rate of mangroves in some areas of Gambia and Senegal increased by 51%(Associated Press)</p>
<h4>Gambia's Strategy</h4>
<p>Enfamara Danpa still remembers the extreme weather incident he encountered for the first time, as if this happened yesterday.</p>
<p>That was in 1999, Tenpa, 10, stood on the balcony outside the house with his parents, siblings. A sudden thunderstorm and heavy rain attacked their villages located in Gambia, the smallest country in the African continent. This phenomenon is commonly known as "rain bombs". In it, because the walls of the house will collapse. "</p>
<p>The storm destroyed the roof of most houses around them. The walls of the building collapsed, and the falling trees blocked the road. Danpa's house was spared, but the fence was destroyed. The next morning, when he was wading, the scale of the disaster caused a greater blow to him: furniture, mattresses, clothes and books drifted along the flooded streets.</p>
<p>At present, Danpa is a research scientist and senior climate change consultant of the World Bank. When another "rain bomb" exploded in this West African country in July last year, and affecting nearly 40%of the population and led to thousands of people, he recalled Some of the original scenes.</p>
<p>Today, the country is not only at the forefront of the global climate crisis, but also strives to cope with its most destructive impact. In 2017, Danpa founded the HELP-Gambia to raise fiscal resources to support local disaster resistance, such as climate change awareness, adjusting agricultural practices to adapt to the changing weather model and support green enterprises, especially for green enterprises, especially It is the most vulnerable community in Gambia.</p>
<p>His initiative is one of the local movements of a series of similar climate -driven nationwide. These movements together make this West African country a rare and successful typical example of global response to climate change. In 2021, Gambia became the only country in the world to make a brief promise of climate change in Paris.</p>
<p>The core of Gambia's strategic strategy is the concept of agricultural and forestry. Traditionally, agriculture and forests are often regarded as competitors of land, and the increase in grain demand has led to felting in forest. On the other hand, agriculture and forestry involves the practice of land use of trees and forests. The country announced the national agricultural and forestry strategy in 2022, with the goal of restoring 7,000 hectares of degraded forests within 10 years.</p>
<p>This is based on the long -term reconstitution efforts, and Gambia has restored 6.6%of forest coverage from 1990 to 2005. Studies have also shown that the local mangrove coverage rate has increased by 51%, and this area between Gambia and Senegal from 1988 to 2018 effectively helps to curb erosion and reduce the strength of the flood. All of this is to reduce the country's net carbon emissions to net zero level by 2050.</p>
<p>As the state shown in "Rain Bouncing", the country pointed out in its long -term strategic documents that "Gambia has no choice."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T09-24-51/2016-11-05T120000Z_1018711157_S1AEULCGPQAA_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATECHANGE-ACCORD-SOLAR-1687831166-1687857231.jpg" />On November 4, 2016, the hot solar power plant in Morocgun Nur II Walzazart. Morocco is more and more supplying solar energy to Europe(Reuters)</p>
<h4>solar energy</h4>
<p>In eastern Gambia, a much larger inland Mali is facing a power crisis: 83%of the country's population cannot use electricity.</p>
<p>Until recently, the country's solution was that the dispersed diesel power mini power grid (small generator set) was powered on to supply power in rural areas. Now, it is turning these networks into small solar grids.</p>
<p>In the international renewable energy agency(IRENA)And Abu Dhabi Development Foundation(ADFD)With the support of $ 9 million loans, the country has now deployed such a system. 4 MW Solar Mini Grid Systems aims to provide clean energy for 123,000 people in 32 villages. This can help Mali reduce 5,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions -1,000 mini power grids can almost eliminate the country's carbon footprint.But this is not all. Tania Martha Thomas, a researcher at the International Organizational ChatobServate of Paris, which is headquartered in Paris, monitoring the climate and biological diversity trend, said that these solar micro -grids can store electricity in batteries for local use. This saves the labor time of thousands of women. In the past, they needed to travel long distances to take water, and now they can use electricity to pump water.</p>
<p>To north, Morocco is leading the Solar Revolution of North Africa. This revolution can not only meet the energy needs of the region, but also meet the energy needs of the Mediterranean coast and Europe. At this time, the war in Ukraine in Ukraine has disrupted oil and oil and oil and of the region. Natural gas supply.</p>
<p>Morocco's giant solar power plant has exported power to Spain through two submarine cables. Last year, as the Ukrainian war intensified, the country reached an agreement with the European Union to further increase exports. The largest new project that is about to launch involves laying the world's longest high -voltage submarine cable in order to transport solar energy from the Sahara Desert in Morocco through Portugal, Spain, and France, and transportation to Britain. Its goal is to meet the 8%of Britain's total energy demand on the occasion of 2030.</p>
<p>Egypt and Tunisia also want to export solar energy to Europe.</p>
<p>However, if the world really eliminates global warming, we need not just energy exports. Countries also need to learn how to reverse the edge of the disaster.</p>
<p>Costa Rica is a small country in Central America, and it can provide us with valuable lessons.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T09-24-51/AP22256070062294-1687831654-1687857289.jpg" />On August 24, 2022, a frog climbed up to the branch of the forest in the suburbs of San Jose, Costa Rica. Costa Rica has become one of the countries with the highest forest cutting rate in the world in the 1980s, becoming a country centered on ecological tourism, and attracted many tourism enthusiasts around the world.(Associated Press)</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Today, Costa Rica is often among the most environmentally friendly countries in the world.</p>
<p>But the situation is not always the case. In the 1940s, the country's nearly three -quarters of the country was covered by the rainforest. Later, the lumberist used the trees to get rich and want to destroy the land. By 1987, its forest coverage rate fell to only 21%.</p>
<p>Stanford University researcher Kelly Langhans told a reporter from the Peninsula, "This is a country with a superbly biodiversity, and it was once a model of environmental destruction."</p>
<p>Kelly said that in the past 35 years, the country has adopted "a set of innovative protection funds and policy mechanisms", which has made the country's reputation very different from before the 1980s. Today, these mechanisms have become a model of environmental policy makers.</p>
<p>Now, more than half of the country's forests are prosperous again. According to news from the "Climate Operation Tracking" platform, Costa Rica is one of the only nine countries that have adopted one of the "almost enough" countries to slow down climate change measures, and Morocco and Gambia are also on this list.</p>
<p>Based on a key policy to help achieve this huge transformation, Costa Rica pays the fees for communities and land owners who protect the environment (including trees coverage, biological diversity, and water cleaning). The funds of the plan are mainly taxed by fossil fuel.</p>
<p>Since 2014, the country has almost relied on renewable energy. More than 7%of all passenger cars are electric vehicles, which are higher than the United States, Canada and other countries in Latin America. Electric vehicles are exempted from taxation and import tariffs, and car owners can also enjoy a series of other benefits, including free parking at designated locations and exempting annual road licenses.</p>
<p>This impressive record enabled Lang Kelly and her colleagues to decide whether Costa Rica could better implement its re -afforestation strategy.</p>
<p>She also pointed out, "We know that Costa Rica is interested in re -afforestation, so we want to know how the country can determine the goal of the country's rejuvenation in the case of limited land and funds that protect the target. Region that provides the maximum benefits. "</p>
<p>She and her team discovered that the 10 -meter -width -wide area on the coast of Costa Rica (equivalent to nearly 1%of the total land area of the country) can significantly improve water quality by reducing sediments and reducing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. In addition, it will help carbon sealing work, that is, the process of capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Researchers have found that if these reassessment work is concentrated in areas where people rely on rivers to obtain drinking water, these results may be further enlarged.</p>
<p>However, if it is difficult to achieve climate change in response, it is difficult to maintain success -Gambia is learning this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T09-24-51/AP22208815852895-1687832596-1687857344.jpg" />On June 30, 2022, the Somalians who escaped the arid areas carried their property to the temporary camp of the displaced of the displacement in the suburbs of Mogadi(Associated Press)</p>
<h4>Can't do it alone</h4>
<p>Many developing countries with growing development needs are striving to achieve its climatic goals alone, and extreme weather events have exacerbated this development demand.</p>
<p>As the only country that is considered to be in accordance with the goal of the Paris Agreement in 2015, as the only country that is considered to be the goal of the Paris Agreement in 2015, it has become a global headline news. It's almost enough. " Earlier, the country submitted the updated country's independent contribution plan, that is, the blueprint for reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Such plans generally have two components. One of them lists things that the country can complete, and the other summarizes the measures that the country wants to take -but this will depend on international support. According to the "Climate Operation Tracking" platform, although Gambia's domestic efforts are still on the track of Paris's goals, it is backward at the plan that requires global help.</p>
<p>Because developed countries have not fulfilled their commitments to provide a $ 100 billion climate financing to developing countries each year -even if they have promised in 2009, according to the current assessment of the World Bank, it is required to be used for slowing and slowing each year. adapt.</p>
<p>At the same time, countries like Gambia must prepare for the future while dealing with the current crisis.</p>
<p>Danpa of the World Bank has previously served as the executive director of the Gambian National Disaster Administration. During his tenure, he paid close attention to how the extreme weather incidents caused casualties, destroying life, and leaving traces of destruction.</p>
<p>A study by Tanpa in 2020 concluded that most people who left the capital Banjohl, who left the country, belonged to climate immigrants.</p>
<p>He said, "Early studies showed that if the world average sea level rose only one meter, our capital Banzhuer would be submerged in 2100." It will lead to a comprehensive governance or the failure of the country. "</p>
<p>Banzhuer is not only the administrative center of Gambia, but also its economic center.Studies have shown that by 2050, as many as 86 million people in the southern African region of Sarah will be displaced by climate change in the country, and 19 million people will be lost in North Africa. Hurricane Fredi, who attacked southern Africa in March 2023 forced Malawi to relocate nearly 660,000 people.</p>
<p>Sama told the Peninsula TV reporter that without the help of the outside world, fragile African countries will be difficult to cope with the impact of climate change, and they have almost no historical responsibility -no matter how they try to use limited domestic resources.</p>
<p>Danpa also agrees with this view. At present, financial support from the international level can be ignored. He also said, "The estimated cost of the rainstorm incident in July 2022 exceeded the total climate financing received by Gambia in 2018."</p>
<p>Danpa pointed out, "For those who are particularly affected by climate disasters, climate compensation or financing is not development assistance or charity." "This is our moral obligation."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000000.png" />Three years after the "National Security Law" in Hong Kong, did the Taiwanese go to Hong Kong as "political security" as before? The picture shows the Hong Kong International Airport on December 28, 2022. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-06262023104253.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Agence France-Presse information picture <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-06262023104253.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt 06262023104253.html/@stream</a>When China has launched the "new iron curtain" step by step, is Taiwanese still "political security" in Hong Kong? July 1, 2023 is the 3rd anniversary of the Hong Kong version of the "National Security Law", and it is also the effective date for China's "Anti -Spy Law" to expand the crime. Although Hong Kong is actively reopening to the world in the post -epidemic era, it is still inevitable affected by the pressure of China ’s double social monitoring -among them, many Taiwanese scholars who have long been in Hong Kong and have no political current affairs in the research field have specifically felt that the recent" The increase in the pressure on Taiwan Black List, not only one person was detained by the Hong Kong police after arriving in Hong Kong, and was "political inquiry" under the state of banning communication.</p>
<p>But who are particularly needed to pay attention to the safety of going to Hong Kong? In the absence of suspicion of going to Hong Kong, how should the research, publishing, and reports of Hong Kong's research, publishing, and reports be carried out? How will China affect the future and definition of "Hong Kong Studies" when the exchanges in Taiwan have decreased? ****</p>
<p><strong> Taiwanese scholars who consider "not sensitive" have been brought into the small black house by the Hong Kong police </strong></p>
<p>Before the Hong Kong police officer was excused, R may never think of his research, speech or personal background, and had a day when the Hong Kong government was threatened by the Hong Kong government. As an international qualified Taiwanese scholar, Hong Kong is like R's second hometown. He has taught here many years ago. The specialty of the specialty is not directly related to the current politics of Hong Kong. In mid -2019, when Hong Kong's anti -sending China movement began, he traveled to and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and occasionally followed the parade to the streets. For the news of Hong Kong's social dynamics.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning of this year, R, which had originally planned to visit Hong Kong academic visits, was detained by the Customs Entry Department of the Hong Kong Airport. He was first brought to the small room in the small room to ask and searched by a person wearing an inbound police vest. Then he came in a man and a woman. document.</p>
<p>For R, the whole situation is ridiculous. The wall of the small room was announced by "You can contact relatives and friends without violating official duties, and you can ask a lawyer", but he was banned from using his mobile phone during the detention. Because I have taught in Hong Kong, R still continued to have academic connections with local professors in recent years, and also continued to guide Hong Kong students. The connection of these connections seems to be the focus of doubt in Hong Kong authorities. The 6 -hour inquiry process is mainly on a few questions, including: "Who knows in Hong Kong" and "During the work in Hong Kong, do you have any salary / who work for free?"</p>
<p>In addition to the customs police officer, there are also plainclothes in and out. They come back and forth in the small room, as if they continue to ask for a superior, although there is no suspicious clue from R. Essence During the repatriation, he took a prison car with an iron fence. "This is the first time in my life to take a prison car. Nine people stare at me, making me like terrorists." R recalled.</p>
<p>In the past three years, among 8 major universities in Hong Kong, many university professors have left Hong Kong, especially in the humanities and social fields. R is one of them. But he always hopes that he can freely enter and exit Hong Kong, after all, he is not doing sensitive political research. Although the repatriation beyond his expectations, he said that the whole process was not nervous, but he was helpless. He was glad to hear the suggestions of friends who were doing research in China and Hong Kong. Before going to Hong Kong, he only brought an empty mobile phone. At least there was no more communication materials and privately intercepted.</p>
<p>R still want to step on the red line by stepping on the red line before R, before the Hong Kong government is included in the blacklist, but he decided not to go to Hong Kong within at least 3 or 5 years. "If they use the extension of the war to ask Can you persist? Will it be swallowed? I really don’t know. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000002.png" />On November 19, 2021, the Guangzhou -Shenzhen -Hong Kong High -speed Railway Hong Kong West Kowloon Station was conducting cross -departmental anti -terrorism TigerPace (TigerPace), a "extremist" of the police arrested the entry in the customs.

<p>R's experience is not a misunderstanding or a single case. According to the interview with the "Reporter", several Taiwanese scholars have been pulled into the small black house of Hong Kong Airport in the past two years, making political backgrounds and interrogation on the Internet in Hong Kong. Some of these cases were repatriated by the original machine, but some people were released into the country after handling the itinerary and interpersonal relationships in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Since the umbrella movement in 2014, the Hong Kong government has a "blacklist" for democratic people in Taiwan. Researcher Wu Jiemin and others were signed in Hong Kong in 2017 -therefore unable to enter Hong Kong. However, the recent cases including R, the objects are young scholars who cannot directly think of the democratic movement. This is obviously different from the logic of the Hong Kong Government's past only targeting the "leader" and "opinion leaders".</p>
<p>Because the Taiwanese are repatriated in foreign countries, and will not leave a special record or return mechanism in Taiwan's entry and exit, how often does the Taiwanese have encountered "political reasons" in Hong Kong? What are the characteristics of the "high risk goal" explained by the Hong Kong police? The outside world is still unknown.(Note: The representative office of the Taiwan station in Hong Kong is managed by the MAC and the name of the resident in Hong Kong is "Taipei Economic and Cultural Office". Since 2018, the Hong Kong government has been on the grounds that the Taiwan MAC refuses to sign the "one China commitment letter" as a letter. , Stop issuing or updating the visa of the Taiwan delegation in Hong Kong, so when the last Taiwanese official stationed in Hong Kong expired on July 30, 2021, there is no Taiwanese representative in Hong Kong in Hong Kong. It can only be operated by more than 40 Hong Kong -based appointment workers. But after the Hong Kong version of the "National Security Law", all walks of life are also worried about the safety of Hong Kong employees in Taiwan's representative offices. It is more difficult to make public statements.)</p>
<p>In the past six months, Taiwan's academic circles, media communities and publishing circles have closely evaluated the risks of Taiwanese people to Hong Kong. Because at the end of March this year, Fucha (name Li Yanhe), the editor -in -chief of Taiwan's "Eight Flag" Publishing House, was arrested in China and in Shanghai. China is investigating him for "inciting the crime of splitting the country"; at the same time, a study study in Japan When Hong Kong college students returned to Hong Kong at the end of March to update their ID card, they were anonymous to "Guoan WeChat" because of the online message during studying in Japan, and were arrested by the Hong Kong Police Guoan Office with the National Security Law.</p>
<p>The two cases of Fucha and Hong Kong students in Japan have made Taiwan's academic circles particularly nervous, because although the two parties still have Chinese and Hong Kong status, the "place of the crime" charged with the charges of the two is not in China and Hong Kong. Whether this represents the Chinese government is trying to use the "long arm jurisdiction" of the National Security Law -no matter what your nationality and location are, as long as you are suspected of violating the "National Security Law", China and Hong Kong have the right to release you wanted to you want And even pressure the third country to extradite criminal responsibilities -test the response of the international community? Even threatening the safety and freedom of overseas scholars, journalists and publishers, forcing self -examination of Chinese research and speech?</p>
<p>These signals not only make the Taiwan academic circles stress. In the academic exchanges with the humanities and social fields, "do you dare to enter China and Hong Kong for research?" It has also become a popular opening brilliance for scholars in various countries and sharing anxiety.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000004.png" />On June 4, 2023, the people of Taiwan supported Liu Jiayi, a graduate student of Hong Kong University of Taiwan, who was arrested by the Hong Kong police in Hong Kong due to public mourning the Tiananmen incident.

<p>"As far as I know, (for overseas scholars), unless I have been accused of felony, it is currently at most that it has been rejected by Hong Kong." "Said:" Although the National Security Law brings the obstacles (Gets in Theway ", bringing some Chinese elements into the law of Hong Kong, but the" National Security Law "will basically not play a role like turning at the airport (PLAY" (PLAY "(PLAY" (PLAY " in). ".</p>
<p>Mai Gaoden said that he understood many Taiwanese scholars to have doubts about going to Hong Kong, but he reminded everyone that "there is no need to panic." Because so far, Hong Kong has not arrested foreign people (Note), including Taiwanese, including the National Security Law. Moreover, the Hong Kong government is still very concerned about the signboard of "internationalization of education talents". Freedom and personal safety are still relatively guaranteed. Therefore, in addition to involving the discussion of Hong Kong's independence and the current political status of China and Hong Kong, he needs to pay special attention. He believes that the differences between the education site and academic seminars are not very different from before the National Security Law.</p>
<p>(Note: Here is a specially born in Hong Kong and China. Those who have never held Hong Kong and Chinese citizens. Because Li Zhiying, who is charged with the Guoan Law, is a multiple nationality, and holds British citizenship at the same time. However, it is not recognized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese government as a "foreigner.).)</p>
<p>However, Mai Gogade also emphasized that this was just his own "personal experience", which did not mean that he could predict political conditions. For example, after the umbrella movement, Mai Gaodon can still be free to enter China for research, "but now I won't go to China, because they may not let you come out."</p>
<p>"Of course, I have retired, and it is a white man. These may be the reason why I am relatively optimistic. If I am just an assistant professor today, will I worry? If I am a Chinese or Chinese, would I worry about Mai Gaoden said, "I think I may really worry."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000006.png" />On October 19, 2022, the Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao made a speech on the "Hong Kong Talent Outflow Crisis" in the Legislative Council. Under the ruling framework of China's "Patriot Governing Hong Kong", Hong Kong's social surveillance and political censorship has become increasingly serious and seriously harmed international competitiveness. (Photography / Vernonyuen / AP Photo) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-06262023104253.html/ap22292303390184.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000007.png" /></a>In contrast to Mai Gaoden's observation, it is another professor who has teaching experience in China and Hong Kong. "I can't understand why anyone still thinks that Hong Kong has space? From my scene, 'China and Hong Kong The fusion 'is already equal to the completion formula, and there is no difference in politics in both sides. "</p>
<p>For example, in April of this year, the Chinese University passed the Anti -Spy Law will expand from July 1st, and China would immediately conduct a wave of high adjustments to journalists and corporate auditors; but at the same time, Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao and the Chief of Law of the Law of the Law Lin Dingguo also took advantage of the wind direction of Beijing, and the high -profile commitment to complete the "Article 23 of the Basic Law" legislation, which has completed the extremely controversial and in the past, has triggered a large -scale demonstration in Hong Kong. It has been crimes in control of the state power, and it is necessary to further crack down on "stealing national secrets", "prohibiting overseas political organizations or groups in Hong Kong activities" and "prohibiting Hong Kong local political organizations from connecting to overseas groups" to make up for China -Hong Kong and Hong Kong between China and Hong Kong. The "Guoan Vulnerability", which threatens the stability of the Chinese regime, conducts more comprehensive and in -depth high -pressure banning.</p>
<p>W believes that it is difficult for Hong Kong to avoid "Mainland" and the management and control mode towards Chinese society -and under political incentives, this process may accelerate. As the passing American Sinologist Philip A.kuhn described in "Calling the Soul", officials at all levels are the pursuit of Powu Said and promoted. As a result, it is difficult to expected, especially as a new place for the new recovery.<strong> Taiwan reporters interview Hong Kong's risk level? </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000008.png" />The CEDRICALVIANI (left) and the initiative Aleksandra Bielakowsk, CEDRICALVIANI (left), interviewed by the Reporters Sans Frontière.

<p>In addition to the risk of entering Hong Kong in Hong Kong, the "journalist" reported in Hong Kong is the most direct group of threats to the blacklist. In the past, Hong Kong was an international news center in Asia, and it was also the first springboard for global media to report in China. However, after the "National Security Law" passed, the international media represented by the New York Times successively reduced the scale of the resident team in Hong Kong. Even the interviews between Taiwanese reporters entering and leaving Hong Kong also have obvious security.</p>
<p>"We can't propose any accurate indicators to evaluate whether foreign journalists will encounter danger in Hong Kong -because the Chinese government has always said it (Arbitrary)." Reportersans Frontière East Asian office (CEDRICALVIANI) analyzed the "Reporter": "The Hong Kong version of the" National Security Law "is just an excuse for the persecution of the authoritarian government. Laws suitable for the world will not create some very vague definitions to define the object of law enforcement. "</p>
<p>"But the" National Security Law "in Hong Kong is fuzzy that it can cover everything -that is not the law, but the Parody of the law, and there is no predictive at all," said Ai Weiang.</p>
<p>"But we still have some" risk signals' judgment clues. For example, if a reporter's risk is really high, then you will first see that the Chinese government releases information, as if posted on social media to attack attacks on attacks on community media This reporter, or a large number of private messages influx into the reporter's account or mailbox. With the habit of the Chinese government, it usually has such a scary attitude before arresting reporters. "</p>
<p>Ai Weiang believes that the threat of the blacklist encountered by journalists in Hong Kong is mainly divided into three risks: the most dangerous first category is Hong Kong citizens. They cannot be protected by any external forces in the suppression of the National Security Law. The second category of risk levels is Taiwanese interviewed in Hong Kong and China. The third category is Chinese with foreign nationalities.</p>
<p>"Since the Chinese government believes that they have jurisdiction over Taiwan, arrested and detained some Taiwanese journalists or political commentators in Hong Kong, they can also let them express the political propaganda of 'Taiwan is the territory of China." The more dangerous category, I think it is a media person with Chinese ancestry. From the cases of the Chinese government's treatment of Chenglei, Yang Hengjun, and Li Zhiying, the Chinese government has stated that they will put people with Chinese blood in their jurisdiction scope. Inside, even those people have foreign passports. "</p>
<p>Non -Borders reporters emphasized that no reporters have been imprisoned in Hong Kong three years ago; today in Hong Kong, there are currently 13 reporters or free press defenders in Hong Kong. Many reporters have decided to leave Hong Kong, because it is quite dangerous to describe the current situation that Hong Kong is happening. But as of so far, except for a case -a Japanese photographer has been arrested for several hours at the Hong Kong Airport for a few hours, which is the only case in the past three years -no other foreign journalists, including Taiwanese, are not yet included in Taiwanese people. Hong Kong was arrested.</p>
<p><strong> How to evaluate and self -protection in field research and academic exchanges? </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000010.png" />Lin Zonghong, director of the Contemporary China Research Center of Tsinghua University, admits that there is no way to determine a set of SOPs arrested in China and Hong Kong in China and Hong Kong. The law of empirical is no longer useful. (Photography / Yang Zilei) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-06262023104253.html/6.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000011.png" /></a></strong></p>
<p>"It is impossible to judge 'Hong Kong's Political Red Line'. It is also meaningless." Lin Zonghong, director of the Contemporary China Research Center of Tsinghua University, who has been studying, academic interaction and personal experience in Hong Kong, explained to the "Reporter" explaining : "The authoritarian government will not make people clarify the scale of the red line, because this is the best way to spread fear and facilitate rule."</p>
<p>Lin Zonghong said that in the past six months, the Taiwanese academic community has actually fallen into a dilemma. On the one hand, because of the end of the epidemic and opening up and open foreign people in the early years of the year of China and Hong Kong, many field research and academic exchanges should have been used to have a re -contact. Opportunities; but on the other hand, the political pressure under Xi Jinping's rule, in fact, does not decrease and increase after the epidemic prevention. There are sensitive issues in the society, and Taiwanese researchers can only step by step -to some extent, they can only "test the method by body" to some extent. See the trick -did not judge your own risk level, or whether it was included in the blacklist.</p>
<p>In the field studies in China and Hong Kong, Qingda usually gives students some simple self -protection reminders. For example, when students want to enter and exit China and Hong Kong, they should try to avoid strangers at the field scene as much as possible. It is also best to clean the mobile phone and computer, or bring a "clean" device that has not connected to personal social networks and sensitive research materials. Even if you carry a clean dedicated mobile phone, you should cancel the digital passwords, graphics locks and face recognition of general mobile phones, and use the "self -order British password" that is more difficult to be cracked by interrogators to avoid data leakage.</p>
<p>If being detained by the police, the most important thing is to keep calm, you must not acknowledge any crimes, and don't mess up the name materials of others. "If you don't know, you don't know. Instead, it will make you fall into injustice and be more difficult to get away. "In other top international academic units, will there be a more comprehensive mechanism to evaluate the risks of China and Hong Kong? Elifriedman, an associate professor of Sociology, Auxiliary Professor of the Chinese Social Movement and conducted a field survey in China for a long time, has admitted to "Reporter": "Although Cornell University claims to be the most complete The risk management department, but in the face of blacklist and political persecution, it is basically useless (Useless) -they will only see the State Council's risk -level evaluation of a certain area, but that risk is mainly for the factors of war, social instability or epidemic situation. The main indication is a immediately dangerous danger caused by health. "</p>
<p>"Compared to risk assessment guidelines, I think academic institutions should clearly express their promises. 'If the staff happens, we will provide support.'" Fu Qingshan said: "But I am a little worried, universities in American universities will not make public public disclosure. In this way, because my university and most large universities in the United States have important interests in China. "</p>
<p>Fu Qingshan particularly emphasized that compared with foreigners, the risks and pressures assumed by Hong Kong people are actually even more dangerous: "Researchers not only care about their own safety when thinking about risks, but also worry about the objects that endanger our interviews -because now now The most dangerous group of scholars in the situation is Hong Kong people or Hong Kong residents who have studied the Hong Kong issue (HONGKONGISSSUES) — no one wants to make friends and colleagues in Hong Kong in trouble. But this is how the Chinese government operates, such as Xinjiang, in Xinjiang, and Just connect with foreigners, it may make people get trouble. This is why I deliberately cautiously, I haven't contacted Hong Kong or Chinese friends for a long time. "</p>
<p><strong> Silently insisted on the fire stolen: from the Rebirth Human Rights News Award to the Hong Kong Research Group in various places </strong></p>
<p>After Xi Jinping took office in 2013, China was tightening rapidly. For many people, Chinese society has already been "red line everywhere." However, after the social resistance and epidemic in Hong Kong in just three years, Hong Kong caused more than 100,000 people to immigrate to leave Hong Kong. In the one country, the two systems and two systems, there were various aspects of "system replacement".</p>
<p>However, in addition to the continued increase in political risks of some Taiwanese scholars entering Hong Kong, Hong Kong's academic research bases and news reports are encountering possible "copying crisis", which also makes scholars and journalists extremely anxious.</p>
<p>For example, the "Human Right Pressawards", hosted by the Hong Kong Foreign Press Conference (FCC), was temporarily canceled due to the FCC "afraid of violating the national security law" in the past 2022; The NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and MassCommunication, the University of Arizona, were received and resumed. However, alone is the registration, review, and behind -the -scenes operation of the 2023 Human Rights Journal Award, which shows that the post -National Security Times Media's thin ice for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The 2023 Human Rights News Awards mechanism adopted the "full anonymous jury" independent operation method. The judge members did not know each other's true identities, and there was no way to contact the exchange or the opportunity to discuss the judge. On behalf of the organizer's human rights observation, MEFONG explained to the "Reporter": "Adopting a full anonymous and non -contact method of evaluation is actually the security requirements put forward by the judges to the conference."</p>
<p>"We did not ask or disclose the personal background or security details of individual judges. But I believe everyone understands that in many countries in Asia, 'Reporting News' is a difficult career with a high risk and great security threat. "Fang Fengmei has had a wealth of interview experience in China and Hong Kong in the past, and has won the Priced News Award. She understands the dilemma encountered by the first -line reporters -like HRW has been blocked by China, and her support for democratic movement and freedom of speech. It is also regarded by the Hong Kong Government as an unpopular overseas organization. Many Hong Kong journalists and media institutions hope to "anonymous newspapers", because alone have a relationship with HRW, they may be chased by the National Security Law.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000012.png" />Human rights observation and spreading MEFONG said in an interview with the "Reporter" video, "In many countries in Asia, 'Reporting News' is a difficult career with a high risk and great security threat." (Photography / Huang Shize) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-06262023104253.html/7.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T10-00-00-04-00/000013.png" /></a>"Repeating Human Rights News Awards is the result of many people's use of methods and doing their best. We just don't want to let this news value disappear like this," Fang Fengmei said. Finally, the Hong Kong Human Rights News Award in 2023 was announced online to avoid the risks caused by the entity awards.</p>
<p>"The risk of foreign media in Hong Kong does exist," Ai Weiang believes, "Taiwan media and journalists must be prepared for possible risks. For example, from the perspective of media institutions Make China -Hong Kong interview teams more international, so as to diversify diplomatic risks. "</p>
<p>However, Ai Weiang also emphasized: "This does not mean that all reporters in the media world should self -censorship or deliberately avoid China or Hong Kong because of the" National Security Law ". . We cannot easily abandon Hong Kong because of the threat of the National Security Law, which is equivalent to the purpose of allowing China to formulate the National Security Law. ","</p>
<p>In the Cold War of the 20th century, the Communist Party of China had been locked for a long time, and the geographical location was close to the academic atmosphere, and Hong Kong, which was close to the academic atmosphere, and interacted with China, became a glimpse of the Chinese springboard for scholars in various countries. "Global town. However, as Hong Kong sovereignty is transferred to China, after the implementation and suppression of the "National Security Law" in the Hong Kong version of the Hong Kong version of the "National Security Law" is also famous, how to continue the accumulation of past China research and preserve the real history of Hong Kong in Hong Kong. The important task of racing -the "Hong Kong Research Theme Group" established by the Chinese Academy of Society this year, which is one of the Noah's Ark for the inheritance of Hong Kong learning in the world.</p>
<p>"We may have to build a Hong Kong overseas collection land, just like the Chinese Research Center of the Chinese University of Hong Kong," said Lin Zonghong. With Hong Kong's democratic politics and civil society, it has been completely suppressed by the National Security Law. The museum and large bookstores are used to remove sensitive books, or the Hong Kong Government's entry into the court to apply for a ban on the dissemination of the song "I wish to return to Hong Kong". Out of profit.Lin Zonghong said that the purpose of the Hong Kong research theme group is not only transferred to Hong Kong's democratic resistance and political research, but also the "Hong Kong" systematically backup of academic research institutions around the world -though the Hong Kong government continues to continue in the Hong Kong government, the Hong Kong Government continues to continue Now that the blacklist is expanding the blacklist, all academic research may become "sensitive information identified by the National Security Law" overnight, but Provences from all over the world are still stepping on the mottled political red line. Silently continued to stole fire, trying to avoid the history of being deliberately transformed becoming the only memory of the next generation of Hong Kong people's unswerving and challenges.</p>

<p>U.S. Navy Commander Gil Dai Monday (June 26) said that the United States did not underestimate the difficulty of providing nuclear -powered submarine projects to Australia with AUKUS. He also said that it is still not sure how to implement the first batch of nuclear submarines for Australia.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the AUKUS project announced in March in Australia, Britain and the United States in March is planned to be completed in the late 2030s and early 2040s. By then, Britain and Australia will use cutting-edge US technology to produce and operate a kind of SSN-AUKUS New nuclear -powered submarine.</p>
<p>In the early 2030s, the United States should sell three Virginia -class nuclear -powered submarines in Australia. According to the agreement, Australia can order two more ships in the United States.</p>
<p>However, some major issues still exist. The United States has strict restrictions on the extensive technology required by the United States. In addition, the United States has limited production capacity to meet its own needs. It is still a question mark to deliver Virginia -class submarines to Australia.</p>
<p>On Monday, Gil Dai was on the forum of Washington Strategy and International Research Center to ask questions about Virginia -class submarines. He said: "Now answering where these submarines will come from too early, whether it is from the remaining production capacity or the United States inventory."</p>
<p>He said that the priority of the United States is still the production of Columbia -class submarines for the US Navy, "we are trying to make industrial bases improve productivity."</p>
<p>Campbell, a coordinator of the National Security Council, said in the same forum that the "all signs indicate" the AUKUS project will be supported by the US and Australian politics, and Washington is discussing with many countries to participate in the second pillar of Aukus.</p>

Chinese big V to the "rational school" standing team to step on the Red Line afterwards</a></em><strong>[</strong> The most profitable money "writer" Wu Xiaobo was stunned by the most profitable financial and economic writer "(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/gf-06132022084031.html)Wu Xiaobo's recently published article "Only rescue the property market can save domestic demand" pointed out that "the sluggishness of the property market is one of the structural factors of domestic demand downturn." He put forward five suggestions to call on the authorities to make specific legal arrangements and explanations on the issue of real estate tax and property rights as soon as possible, reduce the mortgage interest rate of improving housing, reduce the interest rate of stock loans, fully cancel the price limit policy, and conscientiously implement the "three branches "Arrow" and the policy of insurance.</p>
<p>As soon as Wu Xiaobo's article came out, it caused a warm discussion of public opinion. The blogger "Shanglin Yuan" said, "The time for published this article is highly consistent with the time of the stock market and the commodity market. Wu Xiaobo, who has long observed the Chinese business community and tracking the real estate market, is obviously sensitive enough." However, there are also bloggers. " "Shi Xie Sean" criticized, "Wu Xiaobo's article seems to be considered for the country's economy and people's livelihood, but it is actually to speak for the interests of the real estate industry and housing enterprises. His way of rescue the market is not a real estate market but a housing company."</p>
<p>Financial bloggers "Guan Buyu" posted that "this time, everyone scolded Wu Xiaobo." The blogger said that Wu Xiaobo's article stabbed the honeycomb, most of which were opposed voices. After reading, he felt the word "twisted".</p>
<p>Wu Xiaobo's sound of "rescue the market" immediately "disappeared." The "Security Tips this week" released by Sina Weibo on the 26th stated that "Big V user Wu Xiaobo, etc., through the negative harmful information such as the unemployment rate and dispersing the discreditation of the securities market, publish the content of the attack on the current policy and management system." It is prohibited due to violations of relevant laws and regulations.</p>

Compared to solving problems and positive response problems, covering your mouth is too simple. "Covering a big V's mouth is still so simple, let alone ordinary people?" Another netizen was leaving a message with posts. "Is it the early stage of real estate The rescue of the market appealed too much, touched the red line of the national policy? "</p>
<p><strong> Cheng Xiaonong: The dare speakers have eloquent the royal scholar into the Da Nengxuan Tool </strong></p>
<p>When traveling to the United States, Cheng Xiaonong, when he was interviewed by this station, believes that Wu Xiaobo's article represents the current situation of Chinese society, and recently circulating an article on the Internet "China Six Normal Phenomena" article mentioned that if experts only talk about the government's point of view, the experts only talk about the government's point of view. People do not believe it at all.</p>
<p>"Such articles have mentioned that China's economy is bad and serious. Wu Xiaobo's words are not unique. He just turned some media reports into his words." Cheng Xiaonong said.</p>
<p>Cheng Xiaonong pointed out that Chinese media dare not talk about the political situation and can only talk about the economic situation. At present, the economic negative articles have begun to appear, because China is not only unhappy, but also difficult for the poor. The middle class with a certain economic and social status became the "miserable" class and became "three slaves", which is the slave, the slave and the slave.</p>
<p>Cheng Xiaonong: "Their property shrinks very fast. Most of the wealth of the middle class is real estate. They originally believed that China's real estate was as fixed as the economy, and the wealth at home was like a balloon. Do not reduce more than 10%. "</p>
<p><strong> Wu Xiaobo point out the truth and illusion of employment issues </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the "rescue market" that may touch the red line of the authorities, reviewing the "unemployment rate" is also one of the "crimes" named Wu Xiaobo. Wu Xiaobo recently published the article "Who is providing employment, who supports who is providing employment", and asked why employment issues would "suddenly" become severe. In his opinion, there is a truth in China's unemployment rate, a "illusion": "truth" is the depression of the industrial economy. Private entrepreneurs collectively lack the willingness to invest, which eventually causes the downturn of all watches and coins. "It is the shrinking of rural flood discharge capabilities.</p>

<p>Chen Songxing, director of the New Economic Policy Research Center of Taiwan Donghua University, dismantled China ’s unemployment rate data pointed out that Chinese officials claim that the relevant statistics are using the International Labor Organization(ILO)The standards are not unemployed for more than one hour a week. Even so, China's youth unemployment rate is still as high as 20.8%, and the actual number should be much higher than the data released by the official. In addition, the unemployed migrant workers have not been calculated in the "urban" unemployment data, and flexible employment is also a big problem.</p>
<p>He believes that the current situation of the lives of people in China is the decline in salary, the decline in consumption expenditure, the high -end goods cannot afford, and the price of life is constantly rising: "Everyone knows that the economic prospects are unknown, and it is by no means covering the mouth of the truth, or it is not It can be solved by throwing the so -called big inner propaganda for the mouth. The Chinese people are no longer Wu Xia Amon.</p>
<p><strong> Wu Xiaobo Channel to see China's economic prospects "What are we" </strong> **</p>
<p>In addition to the unemployment rate, the recent works of "Wu Xiaobo Channel" revealed the pessimistic atmosphere of China's economic prospects.</p>
<p>In telling the Story of the Optical Machine ", Wu Xiaobo sighed after watching Miller's" Chip War ": Now, the EUV lithography machine has a comprehensive restriction on China, which has become the most deadly card in the Chinese chip industry. Neck incident. He believes that the best way to not be around the neck "is not to close the door to endogenous independence, but to actively integrate into the global ecosystem, which is part of the non -substitution. Dependence and exchange is the only reason for existence and the last reason."</p>

<p>In the article "Aoretseng and Depression", Wu Xiaobo directly pointed out that someone must tell us loudly, "Tomorrow, the sun will definitely rise." Everyone who looks at China is actually looking at their lives. Even if you are gambling, you have to gamble on the National Games.</p>
<p>Wu Xiaobo has more than 4.73 million fans on Weibo. He has served as a reporter from Xinhua News Agency and later turned into a financial writer. He also founded the media "Wu Xiaobo Channel".

Climb up with a double -layer bed to sleep.</p>
<p>On June 16, this convention was broken by an unknown attacker. These attackers are allegedly "democratic allies"(ADF)The rebels, they stole the border from the Congo (Gold) and attacked the school. Within a few hours, they slaughtered dozens of students, which was the most fatal attack that Uganda experienced in decades.</p>
<p>Monber, 18, recalled that the attacker arrived at about 10:30.</p>
<p>They first fired at the gatekeeper of the school, and then asked the boys to open the door of the dormitory. Monber told a reporter from the Peninsula TV station, "All the students in my dormitory have rejected it."</p>
<p>The leader of the boys asked everyone to hide under the bed, and Monber also acted according to the instructions, while the attacker fired bullets through windows and locked doors.</p>
<p>The attacker entered the dormitory of the girls and killed the students inside. Several medical staff told the Peninsula TV reporter that most students were beaten to death by hammer or chopped to death.</p>
<p>The rebels also forcibly broke into the closed room of the boys and still shot. One of the bullets hit Monber's hand. He wrapped it with cloth.</p>
<p>In the end, these militians set fire and burned the boys' dormitory. So Monber seized the opportunity and escaped into the night.</p>
<p>The 27 -year -old principal's wife, Brenda Masica, heard the sound of gunfire and the students' call for help in his home opposite the school. Her husband was on a business trip, and she took 3 children alone.</p>
<p>She pointed out that a man wearing a green uniform and holding a gun walked into her house. He took away her mobile phone and the food she left, and threatened to kill her. It wasn't until he saw that she had a little baby that he allowed the family to leave, and then set fire to destroy the house.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, Masika saw the corpse of the gatekeeper and the destroyed boys' dormitory. When the building was burned, she stood there and cried, but could not save anything at home.</p>

<h4>After attack</h4>
<p>The rebels abducted six students and robbed the food stores. They then escaped Montvir, burned more houses, killed local villagers, and returned to the Congo (Gold).</p>
<p>Local executive Clarenos Bvambel explained that at 1 am, the corpse began to be derived from the general elimination of a local hospital.</p>
<p>According to the official report issued by the Police, a total of 37 students and 5 villagers were killed. A few days after the attack, another woman died of severe injuries due to serious heads, which caused the total number of deaths to 43. The age of the victims does not wait from 12 to 25.</p>
<p>17 corpses were sent to the nearby Portleburg City for DNA identification because they have been burned to be omnipotent.</p>
<p>Dawn on June 17, parents came to claim their children's bodies. The crowd was so turbulent that the hospital had to close the door and let them divide them into three batches into the peace.</p>
<p>The staff worked hard to soothe the family members of grief.</p>
<p>Bavambell told a reporter from the Peninsula TV station that "it is an unbearable thing to lose a person and lose a child in such a terrible way." "Crying is also a part of healing. Let them cry, and then comfort them."</p>
<p>At noon, the mourner began to buy a coffin.</p>
<p>Banjiga Satrite operated a carpentry shop on the side of Montville. Since the attack, he has sold 17 coffins. In view of the tragedy that occurred, these coffin sold at a discount price. He told a reporter from Peninsula TV, "My customers cried, so I sold it very cheaply."</p>
<p>Salleter said that this is the most difficult period for coffin manufacturers, "there are many corpses."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T12-00-33/Burnt_Out_Dorm_1-1687791781-1687866611.jpg" />There are only double layers of bed frames and some personal items in the boys' dormitory of Rubila Middle School(Peninsula TV Station)</p>
<h4>Uknames and problems</h4>
<p>As Montvir was sad, the Uganda authorities blamed the attack on the anti -government "democratic allies". Uganda President Jonori Musewini stated in a statement that their actions were "criminal, desperate, terrorism, and futile."</p>
<p>Anti -government "Democratic Allied Forces" was first established in western Uganda in 1995. Three years later, these rebels launched a similar attack on Montville at the Kicchiba Technical College, killed 80 students and abducted more than 100 people.</p>
<p>The organization finally moved to the Congo (Gold) in 2001 and continued to cause serious damage to the local civilians.</p>
<p>In 2015, the leader of the "Democratic Allied" Jamil Marcuru was arrested in Tanzania. His predecessor -Musa Caka Baruku subsequently swore to loyalty to isis.</p>
<p>According to the latest report of the United Nations Congo (Gold) experts, the "Democratic Allied Forces" partners in Uganda received at least 60,000 US dollars of remittances from a ISIS base from Somali from 2019 to 2020, while ISIS claimed to be " The Democratic Allied Forces "recently committed crimes in April.</p>
<p>However, the direct communication and cooperation between the "Democratic Allied Forces" and ISIS is still blurred.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the previous attacks caused political ripples in the area. In October 2021, an explosion occurred in a pork restaurant in the center of Camppara City, which killed three people and prompted Uganda and the Congo (Gold) to launch a joint operation to expel the "democratic allies".</p>
<p>After the attack of Montvir, Musewini threatened "hunting the Democratic Allied terrorists until it was completely eliminated." Uganda sent more troops over the border to rescue students. As of now, 3 people have been found.</p>
<p>Dick Olam, who is responsible for directing the Uganda army in the Congo (Gold), told reporters that with the help of local collaborators, the Democratic Allied forces stayed in the city for two days and then attacked the school. Last week, officials arrested 20 people due to suspected instability of the rebels, including the principal of the Rubilar Middle School.</p>
<p>The residents of Montville said privately that the "Democratic Allied Forces" can easily cross the border between Uganda and the Congo (Gold) -this border is often used by smuggles. On these paths, men wearing uniforms often can sometimes patrol the Uganda army, or they heard the gunfire from the soldiers when they hear soldiers hunting criminals at night.</p>
<p>After the attack, the shocked community called for more protection. Salleter said, "We can't sleep well", "We don't know what will happen."Oumar Nadu, the secretary -general of the Nia Carihia Mosque from Montville, said, "We have returned to the house very early." "In the evening, when you come back, they may even directly take you directly. take away."</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>A week later, under the frustration and quiet, sadness was still shrouded over the small town of Mand Pilter. Families living near Rubilag have evacuated the area. Others rushed home before dark.</p>
<p>The 50 -year -old Marceraka Lotty is one of the condolences, and his brother is the killer who was killed. Lotti said, "We could sit down to plan for my family." "Now that I am alone."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-06-27T12-00-33/Maskera_Loti_Lost_Relatives_2-1687791276-1687866670.jpg" />Masisreka Lotto's brother Mulbas Zefinius served as the goalkeeper at the school, and he was killed in the attack on June 16, 2023(Peninsula TV Station)His nephew Elton was also killed by the attacker. His other nephew disappeared. The family has sent their DNA samples to comparison, but they don't know if he is being burned.</p>
<p>Lotti said, "We can only wait."</p>
<p>They hung the three photos of the missing and dead relatives outside the home with nails, and stringed these photos together with the weary yellow tingle.</p>
<p>The gate of Rubilar Middle School has been closed and the police guard.</p>
<p>The boys' dormitory was filled with the thick smoke flavor burned, and the metal double -layer bed was stuck with burnt clothes fragments. Some personal items are scattered on the ashes.</p>
<p>The information written by the students is almost difficult to identify on the dark walls.</p>
<p>When a reporter from Peninsula saw Monber last Wednesday, he was still in the rehabilitation stage and was not sure when he could be discharged. But he wanted to return to school to continue his studies to realize his dream of becoming an engineer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/st1-06272023045212.html"><strong> Taiwan Hanguang Exercise will perform for the first time at Taoyuan Airport to perform for ban on navigation on July 26 </strong></a>Taiwan media "Lianhe Daily" disclosed on June 27. Combined with the US military observation regiment last year, the Taiwan Army Hantu Real Bing exercise will verify Taoyuan Airport for the first time this year(Peach machine)Aquatic aircraft offensive and defensive subjects. The Navy 151 Fleet combines the AAV7 amphibious assault vehicle of the Marine Corps. It has completed the surrounding Taoyuan Zhuwei Yuku Fishing Port Beach amphibious landing trial before the month. The defense army carried out counterattacks and regained the airport. Because the runway will be temporarily closed during the exercise, it will affect the flight and landing.</p>
<p>Taiwan Media Zhongshi News Network reported that in the past, the anti -airborne project of the Hanguang exercise was almost all held at Qingquan Airport or other military airports at Taichung's Qingquan Airport or other military airports, as well as Pingtung Manfa Farm in Taichung. However, this year's Ministry of National Defense's plan to perform exercises in Taoji this year is quite surprising. The report pointed out that this move may be closely related to the national army's assumptions that the enemy's army landed from the red beach from Zhuwei.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T12-05-00-04-00/000002.png" />The Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan stated that the purpose of the exercise is to verify the combat plan, and continue to coordinate with each other, the division of labor and announcement with relevant departments such as aviation management, civil aviation, and police forces to take into account the training and flight safety.

<p>Su Ziyun, director of the National Defense Strategy and Resources Research Research Institute of Taiwan ’s National Defense Security Research Institute, accepted an interview with this station. From the perspective of defense operations, the scope of exercise is more indirectly related to the red beaches of Zhuwei. He further explained that if the enemy landed around Taipei, from the Shalun in the freshwater to the Nanlian Fishing Port in Hsinchu, there will be three attacks: "First of all, grab the Taipei port, the second is to attack Taoyuan Airport, the third It's directly attacking Taipei. "</p>
<p>Among them, in the peach machine exercise, Su Ziyun pointed out that on the one hand, airport defense, and the second is anti -airborne to prevent the enemy from being forcibly landed to occupy the airport with airborne forces or transport aircraft. Taking Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an example, Russia occupied the airport next to Kiev, and the Ukrainian forces fought back to prevent Russian airborne forces and transport aircraft landing: "Another point of this exercise is to let the fighter set aside. It is when the military base is attacked and closed, the military aircraft can use Taoyuan Airport to take off and land. "</p>
<p>Su Ziyun said that the north runway of Taoyuan Airport has 3660 meters, 3800 meters in the south runway, and the fighter takes off about 500 meters. If the enemy is to be paralyzed such a long runway, the runway must be cut into eight sections, and the fighter cannot take off and land. The peach machine used by civil aviation to join the exercise subject can allow the Taiwan Air Force to have more space and flexibility, and to have more toughness during the war.</p>
<p><strong> Taoji 7.26 exercise will be released for 1 hour forbidden navigation notification </strong></p>
<p>The Taiwan official media Central News Agency quoted the military people that the preliminary plan of the above exercise was held on July 26 and will be released for a 1 -hour forbidden navigation notice. However, the actual exercise time should be less than 1 hour, thereby minimizing the impact of civil aviation. In addition, relevant departments will also notify major airlines in the near future and issue international flights.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan stated that the purpose of the above exercises is to verify the combat plan, and continue to coordinate with each other, the division of labor and announcement of related departments such as aviation management, civil aviation, and police forces to take into account the training of combat reserve and flight.</p>

<p>Ke Wenzhe changed his mouth that he was a "anti -black box" service trade, not "anti -service trade".

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-27T12-27-16-08-00/26ukraine-ledeall-01-vjwt-master1050.jpg" />On Monday, although Putin responded to his reaction to the Wagner's hiring organizer organization on the weekend, he hinted that he would deal with people participating in the rebellion. Still condemning this rebellion was "ransom".</p>
<p>Putin's speech on Monday evening was the first publicly published in the past two days <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71528">speech</a>He refused to read the name of Wagner's leader Yefgeni Pleigo behind the rebellion. His contempt for some people is obvious. These people seem to threaten the civil war and subvert Russia's war in Ukraine -the Ukrainian army is currently launching a counterattack.</p>
<p>"They want the Russians to kill each other," said Russian President Putin. "They rubbed their hands and dreamed of revenge for them at the front and the so -called counterattacks."</p>
<p>The Kremlin was trying to create a normal, united and stable atmosphere all day. However, after experiencing the most serious crisis during the 22 years, Putin did not appear in the public view. When the Russian leader finally appeared, he avoided a series of unreasonable issues left by the rebellion. On Monday, the core of his five -minute speech was to insist that the country and government he led to maintain a united front on all threats.</p>

<p>He said: "Citizen unity shows that any attempt to extort or create internal turmoil is destined to fail."</p>
<p>The Wagner troops claim that they have reached <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/24/world/europe/prigozhin-putin-russia.html">within 200 kilometers of Moscow</a>In the area, the Kremlin spokesman said that after the agreement was reached, the soldiers stopped abruptly. The agreement asked Perigo to be exiled to Belarus instead of accepting punishment. Putin said that Wagner soldiers who do not want to join the Russian regular army can also go there.</p>

<p>After the speech was delivered, the TV showed that he convened the Minister of Defense, the Minister of the Interior, the Attorney General, the Security Department, and the head of the National Guard to convene a meeting to discuss how to deal with the incident.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Pricig was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/world/europe/putin-prigozhin-wagner.html?searchResultPosition=6">important allies of Putin</a>On Monday, he released a 11 -minute conscious stream memo on the TELEGRAM in the instant messaging application, saying that the government was trying to destroy Wagner, and he said Wagner had to dissolve before Saturday.</p>
<p>"We go to demonstration to protest, not to overthrow the government of the country," he said when talking about the fuse of Moscow's entry into Moscow. But Kremlin officials claimed that this was a traitor, not protest.</p>
<p>In the audio information on Monday, Pritigon once again severely criticized the way Russia's military leaders handled the invasion and accused them of attacking them again when the Wagner soldiers were preparing to abandon heavy weapons.</p>

<p>"The purpose of this movement is to prevent Wagner from being destroyed and ride some people to the law. In the process, they made a lot of mistakes because of unprofessional behavior," he said.</p>
<p>It is unclear where Pricig will be in office, and it is not clear how the Russian system will deal with him. Under the system, even the objection will be designated as criminal crimes, let alone armed rebellion. The Kremlin issued a statement on weekends saying that he would be allowed to exile, but on Monday, multiple official media reports reported that he was still facing investigation and was likely to be prosecuted, which contradicts Monday's statement.</p>
<p>His tens of thousands of soldiers -the most experienced and efficient troops in Russia -where will it go, and how this will affect the Ukrainian war, these are not clear. The government demands all the unconventional forces that fight for Russia in Ukraine to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense before July 1, which marks the end of Wagner's semi -independent state, but it is unclear how many troops have already done or will do so.</p>
<p>Putin indirectly answered a question that many people at home and abroad since the beginning of the self -soldiers began: Russia ’s clear military strength has a greater advantage. Why did n’t they be able to occupy a military district headquarters and advance to Moscow hundreds of kilometers, quickly and ruthlessly. Suppress it?</p>
<p>"From the beginning of the incident, my direct instruction was to avoid the occurrence of large -scale bleeding," he said. "This takes time, including giving the wrong person a chance to change the idea."</p>

<p>President Biden said in the White House on Monday that he had held a video conference with the leaders of the allies to discuss the situation of the mutiny. He also said, "What we have to be clear is that we have not participated in it. We have a relationship with this matter. No. This belongs to the issue of struggle in the Russian system. "</p>

<p>According to a draft document seen by Reuters, the European Commission will call on member states to prepare for the impact of the "overflow" of the increase in the increase in climate change.</p>
<p>The European Union also warned that it is necessary to evaluate risk assessments to the large -scale technical intervention that changes the climate. Technical intervention is considered a potential way to solve global warming.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that the European Commission said in the draft documents issued on Wednesday (June 28) that governments and Brussels need to take action to cope with increasing risks due to climate change.</p>
<p>The draft says that "we should face more (climate change) overflow effects for the EU."</p>
<p>"The emergence of these problems may be due to increased assistance demand, disrupted supply chains, and people who have escaped from unsuitable residential areas or extremely harsh climate conditions, and may lead to the increase in the number of domestic and unconventional immigrants in China."</p>
<p>The European Commission said that the European Union will begin to analyze a series of security -related climate effects, including immigration migration and evaluating the security impact of global abandonment of fossil fuel.</p>
<p>The draft also mentioned the potential large -scale technical intervention measures related to the earth's engineering and designed to cool the earth, saying that these technologies constitute new risks, and we know too little about these risks.</p>

<p>95%of the world's food production relies on soil, but one -third of the world's soil has degraded. Heavy machinery, fertilizer and pesticides used in intensive agriculture will accelerate soil degradation. The World Economic Forum stated that "within 50 years, there may not be enough soil to plant food to support the world."</p>
<p>The focus of regenerative agriculture is to improve soil health. The huge potential of healthy soil to be developed will help reduce emissions, promote the realization of climate and natural goals, improve livelihood and ensure food safety.</p>
<p>China ’s total grain imports in 2021 exceeded 160 million tons, mainly from the United States and Brazil. Yao Junkun, manager of the Enterprise Affairs Department of Yazhen International Group, told FT Chinese website after the meeting that regenerative agriculture is an inevitable trend of global food security transformation. Public consciousness and consumer concepts also need to change.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 27, Tianjin Summer Davos's "importance of soil" theme sub -forum, Fan Shenggen, a professor of Chinese Agricultural University, said that to keep the "cultivated land red line", it is also necessary Yi is the challenge facing Chinese agriculture and land. "Small farmers" refer to farmers with less than 10 acres (about 0.67 hectares) operating arable land. According to the third national agricultural census data in 2017, the proportion of 210 million small farmers accounted for 79.6%of all farmers.</p>
<p>Yu Xiaowang, general manager of the Chinese Group of Yazhen International Group, pointed out in his speech that the main challenges faced by small farmers are: 1. Lack of knowledge channels and technologies for small farmers to understand and analyze soil and crops; Soil conditions. To solve these problems requires close cooperation in upstream and downstream, including providing financial funding, it is feasible.</p>
<p>"Innovation must have a lot of wings." Fan Shenggen believed that he needed the current support system for reform. He cited an example from a policy perspective: "At a place 50 kilometers away from the venue (referring to the venue), the groundwater surface has reached a record low. The government uses subsidies of 500 yuan per mu to encourage farmers not to extract groundwater irrigation to slow down the groundwater level. "</p>
<p>"There are more creatures in the soil than the global population. We have to listen to the needs of the soil." Olekristiansivertsen, president and group CEO of the Norwegian Desert Control (Desert 14 /40 Control), pointed out that in the face of the soil that has been completely exposed, you can The method of covering crops is used to protect existing soils instead of simply not farming; at the same time, the carbon capture capacity of soil is also worthy of being developed. However, Fan Shenggen also pointed out that even if the existing technology can reduce agricultural carbon emissions, if technology cannot be mass -produced, farmers cannot inspire farmers to use it.</p>

Putin said that from May 2022 to May 2023, Wagner received 86.262 billion rubles ($ 1 billion) wages and bonuses, which came from the Russian Ministry of Defense and the national budget. Last Saturday, Wagner's rebellion shocked Russia. His leader, Eveni Poriger, arrived in Belarus on Tuesday after he agreed to leave Russia. Belarus leader Lukashenko confirmed his arrival. Earlier, a private jet -related private jet was tracked to Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Last Saturday, the mercenaries led by Wagner's owner Yofgeni Porigerjin occupied Rostov on the Russian city of Russia, and marched to Moscow, which shot down the Russian military helicopter and a plane on the way. After the agreement was reached with the help of Lukashenko, their rebellion was suspended. The Russian authorities said Wagner would be lifted, but his members would escape prosecution due to their brief rebellion. Putin said: "We always respect the soldiers and commanders of this group, because they do show bravery and heroism." He said that the authorities would pay the investigation to pay for the money of Wagner and its leaders. The Russian Ministry of Defense said Wagner is preparing to transfer heavy weapons and equipment to the Russian army. According to the relevant departments of the Russian Federal Security Agency, criminal allegations of those participating in the rebellion have also been revoked. The Federal Security Agency said that Wagner members were facing prosecution due to armed rebellion, but the case had been closed because the rebels did not really commit crimes. Putin said on Monday that the Wagner soldiers either joined the regular army or went home or went to Belarus. Lukashenko said Belarus has not yet begun to build any camp for the organization members, but if they are willing, they will provide them with accommodation. Earlier on Tuesday, Putin told the Russian army in Moscow that their actions during the mutiny prevented a "civil war" and mourned for the victims for a minute. He insisted that the Wagner Army was never supported by the army or the people. Although the Wagner army left Rostov on the River on the River, the crowd cheered and applauded for the Wagner army. According to reports from Broadcasting Corporation, the treatment of Russian mercenaries is in sharp contrast to the treatment of opposition politicians and activists, and many of them are prison only because they publicly oppose the Ukraine War. For example, the opposition activist Vladimir Cara-Mulza(Vladimir Kara-Murza)He was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the crime of rebellion. In comparison, Tagner's leader Progetsu and armed personnel participating in the rebellion seemed to be released. Pricigo defended his behavior, insisting that the rebellion was not to challenge Putin's leadership position. On the contrary, he described him as a mercenary organization that saved him from being absorbed by the Russian army and revealing the failure of the country's military leadership.

Seven months after Zhang Guilin was announced by the disciplinary inspection department in November last year, Zhang Guilin was established and was officially "double -opened."</p>
<p>In the charges of Zhang Guilin, the authorities accused Zhang Guilin, "Books and periodicals with weak political awareness, and public -hidden, reading with serious political issues" ranked first, followed by receiving gifts, consumption cards, and reporting personal matters. Crime crime of bribery such as rights and money transactions. This rare crime of "political issues" has once again triggered heated discussion among public opinion.</p>
<p>In an interview with this station, Lin Shengliang, a Chinese dissident in the Netherlands, analyzed in this interview that in recent years, the sense of crisis of the CCP's firm regime has risen sharply in recent years. Come to political rectification to strictly investigate the loyalty of officials.</p>
<p>"The book must be related to Xi Jinping. When it comes to the ban, it was often a similar book" Xi Jinping and his lover "published by the Causeway Bay Bookstore in Hong Kong at that time.

According to Article 45 and 46 of the "Communist Party Disciplinary Regulations", related to the definition of "books and magazines with serious political issues", in addition to publicly publicizing the four basic basic positions of bourgeois liberalization, opposition to four basic items, opposition to four basic items In principle, in addition to the decision -making of the opposition party's reform and opening up, it is obviously more sensitive to discuss the central government's policy, destroy the party's centralized unity, uglown the party and the state image, slander the party and the state leaders, and distorting the party history and the history of the military.

<p>Deng Yanwen believes that, to some extent, the CCP authorities have currently reached the extreme of the purity and political loyalty of party members and cadres, and the concreteness of party loyalty is to be loyal to Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Wang Ruiqin, a former member of the Qinghai Provincial Political Consultative Conference, also pointed out that the so -called "private collection, reading books with serious political issues", which is a common phenomenon in this generation of young cadres who enjoy the dividends of reform and opening up. She believes that the crime of economic is large or small, but once it rises to political loyalty, there is basically no room for rotation. Therefore, this political charges are likely to be an important tool used in the party's struggle to clean up the dissidents, and it will also cause the "cold cicada" effect among other party members and cadres.</p>
<p>According to the report from the Communist Party of China, it is very popular. In 2018, when the original deputy governor of Guizhou was "double -opened", similar charges also appeared; in the case of Sun Zhengcai, the former secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, Wu Dehua, the former member of the former member of the Yubei District District Committee involved in the case Watch "books and magazines with serious political issues."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese) published an analysis article in Switzerland's "New Zurich", arguing that Wagner Group's mutiny has caused China to worry about Russia's unstable. The article pointed out that after the military change occurred, the official Chinese media did not report as soon as possible, showing the tension of Beijing leaders.</p>
<p>"The event that happened on the weekend relentlessly revealed the vulnerability of Russian President Putin's status, which undoubtedly sounded the alarm to Chinese leaders. If the Putin's system was shaken or even collapsed, it may bring unpredictable consequences to China.</p>
<p>Russia and China have nearly 4,300 kilometers. If a civil war occurs in Russia, it may inevitably bring unstable to the border area. The last time the Sino -Russian army was 54 years old. The latest boundary treaty was signed in the late 1990s. If China is involved in a military conflict, it will have an inestimable consequences of its economic development.</p>
<p>Faced with a weakened and even seizure of Russia President, China will lose an important ally in the attempts of the US hegemony. China will fall into the loser's camp again, and its image of a responsible power that is trying to build a peaceful maintenance will be damaged. Since the beginning of the war in February last year, China has never been in a difficult situation like it is now. "</p>
<p>The article is reviewing the low -key in Beijing's low -key on Wagner's mutiny. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瓦格納叛亂-中國朝鮮支持俄國政府/a-66028449">Official response</a>After writing:</p>
<p>"For the Chinese government, the turbulence of Russia happened. According to Western military experts who had close contact with the Chinese military, Beijing was <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/俄乌战况泽连斯基称反攻前线稳步推进/a-65900912">Russia has no effect in Ukraine</a>Very frustrated. The violent resistance of Ukraine, the weakness of Russia, and the unable to win Kiev, all surprised the Chinese government. In addition, Beijing has not expected that the West will be so united in response to Russia's aggression.</p>
<h3>Wagner Anti -Water Russian Media</h3>
<p>The consensus within the Beijing government is that the war will continue for a long time, and the peace solutions are still out of reach. It is confirmed that a few weeks ago, the Chinese envoy Li Hui went to many European countries, including Ukraine, to mediate, and it returned without fruit.</p>
<p>As a result, the Chinese government tried to push the Ukrainian war issue to the background at the public relations level, while looking for the possibility of continuing to support Russia's president behind the scenes. This will further increase Russia's dependence on this powerful neighbor. "</p>
<h3>China can't afford it?</h3>
<p>The "Frankfurt Report" commented to explore the contradictions and dilemma of Germany's policy on China, and pointed out that one of the characteristics of German foreign policy is "avoiding radical voices", which is in line with the minds of Chinese leadership. The article wrote:</p>
<p>"A message that Chinese leadership has spread for many years is: China's rise is an unstoppable process of a world -renowned power. Among them, there is such a layer of words: that is, any country wants to live with the emerging countries in this world. It is not worth it. If a message is repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, and the voices against domestic opposition are suppressed, then one day the world believes that China is indeed like this.</p>
<p>The Chinese leadership headed by Xi Jinping is working hard for this goal. It is for this reason that the Beijing diplomatic community is taken for granted to give scores to the political positions of governments (to China). If a state government dares to say a friendly to democratic island nations in Taiwan, then China will express great 'dissatisfaction', and this will be accused of interfere with internal affairs and unacceptable. However, governments in other countries can also interpret Chinese criticism as interference in the internal affairs, and Beijing does not care about this. First of all, the government of the democratic country rarely does this. "</p>

<p>Xia Ming, a professor of political science in New York University in the United States, told reporters in an interview with this station that in fact, the policy of China has not changed: "From the perspective of unilateral relations, New Zealand or Israel, or EU countries, in China, with China, in China, in China, with China, in China, with China, in China, with China, in China, with China, in China, in China, with China, in China, with China, with China, in China, with China, in China, in China, in China, in China, in China. Of course, one -on -one deal will be much more polite to China, and will not provoke human rights or other controversial issues with China. But in the scene of multilateral relations, the United States, European countries and Japan have coordinated policies, Other small countries will be consistent in pace and will not be free from policy coordination in Western countries. Criticizing various human rights issues in China will not restrain these small countries in multilateral environments, and will also coordinate with the United States and other powers. "</p>
<p>Wang Juntao, a political scholar in the United States, also believes that the structure of small and medium -sized countries regards the United States as the main leader is still unchanged: "The United States has to cooperate with China and not intend to decompose with China. In fact, New Zealand and Israel have developed. The security architecture will not violate the wishes of the United States, and will continue to strengthen the blockade and suppression of China. "</p>
<p>Wang Juntao pointed out that when small and medium -sized countries are seeking cooperation with China, they will focus on not affecting existing interests. For example, New Zealand will focus on output sheep products to China: "Some industries in cooperation with China will not affect the United States' siege policies in China. ","</p>

<p><strong> Reading in one minute: </strong></p>
<p>Recently, after the US Secretary of State Brills ended the interview, multiple Twitter and Weibo "Big V" account forwarded a Plingkenan conversation video. In the film, Brinken said: "During my visit to China, I said to China that we will continue to do something you don't like and say something you don't like." China Sohu, Netease and other platforms followed up reports that Brinken "showed true faces after returning home."</p>
<p>After the Asian facts check the laboratory verification, it is determined that this film is indeed a picture interviewed by Brincken's interview with the United States Broadcasting Corporation (CBS). According to the verbal draft released by the US State Department Duanchi, but his next sentence is "just like you (China), there is no doubt that it will continue to do what we don't like." In the context at that time, Brinken was explaining President Biden's remarks, and described the fact that the two countries would have long -term difference. It belongs to the rules.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth analysis:</strong></p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accepted an exclusive interview with Margaretbrennan, host of the US CBS program Face The National host on June 25. On the morning of the 26th, the Russian Satellite News Agency quoted some of the speeches of Brinken in the interview and "[<a href="https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20230626/1051352812.html">US Secretary of State threatened to continue doing things that China dislikes</a>"Reported as a title.</p>
<p>Beginning on the afternoon of the 26th, the China Sohu and Netease platform followed up, saying that "after visiting China, Brinken showed true face." In the text, the United States is the provocative of the United States who has led to the decline in Sino -US relations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T15-38-00-04-00/000002.png" />Sohu's original article refers to the true colors after the visit of Brinkens, and threatened to continue doing what China does not like. Picture from Sohu <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06272023153202.html/56fe1.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T15-38-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>A number of "Patriotic V" on Weibo also started to repost the relevant films simultaneously. In the film, Brinkin said: "The main purpose of visiting China is to bring greater stability to US -China relations. But there is one thing. I visit. During the Hua period, we said to China that we will continue to do something you don't like and say something you don't like. "</p>
<p>Zhang Heqing, a Chinese diplomat in Pakistan, also shared the film on Twitter, but some netizens left a message to question whether the film was generated by AI.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T15-38-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chinese diplomats in Pakistan also reposted related films, but some netizens suspected that they were generated by AI. Figure taken from Twitter <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06272023153202.html/56fe2.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T15-38-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a>Asian facts check that the laboratory has been verified that the film on the Chinese social media platform is indeed a speeches for Brosky himself.(https://www.cbsnews.com/video/secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-says-we-havent-seen-the-last-act-yet-in-russias-wagner-rebellion/)The picture between 7 minutes and 16 seconds and 7 minutes and 27 seconds is consistent with the videos circulating on the Chinese social media platform.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T15-38-00-04-00/000006.png" />Blint's talks with the host of the CBS show. Picture from the official website of CBS <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06272023153202.html/56fe3.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-27T15-38-00-04-00/000007.png" /></a>However, according to the interview film and the US State Department announced <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-margaret-brennan-of-cbs-face-the-nation-4/">Completely Talking Quiet Draft</a>, Brinken's words are targeted to answer the host's question. The host asked him that as soon as he ended his visit to the middle of the visit, President Biden publicly stated that Xi Jinping was a "dictator", "this(Speak)How harmful to your work? In the face of the problem, Brinken first stated that his purpose of visiting China was to promote the relationship between the two countries to be more stable. But "I said to China during this trip, we will continue to do what you don't like. Just like you will continue to do things that we don't like. "Bollingaki followed:" If you look at the news released by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs every day, you will hear this kind of(Let us not like)Said. "</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The videos circulating on the Chinese social media platform are true, not the generation of AI, but only quoted the first half of Brinton's original words, saying that Brinton unilaterally threatened to continue to say and do things that China disliked, which belongs to the information that is disconnected. According to the context, Brinken's semantics should always be different from the Sino -US position, but they continue to express to each other. Communicate with each other to promote the stability of US -China relations.</p>

<p>Now the "Chinese Dream", everyone knows that it is the dream of a strong country. This is barely realized and finally became the world's second largest economy. few. However, many people seem to have forgotten that the first Chinese dream since the reform and opening up is Deng Xiaoping's common and rich dream of the first rich and rich in reform and opening up. For this rich dream, the Chinese academic community interpreted that China will move towards the olive society (the proportion of the middle class exceeds half of the population), but this dream has now become Nanke's dream.</p>
<p><strong> University is no longer the cradle of cultivation of the middle class </strong></p>
<p>China is currently worried about the decline in total fertility. In January of this year, the National Bureau of Statistics of China announced that the national population decreased by 850,000 in 2022, the first time in more than 60 years of negative population growth; the reasons for the decrease in the total population was due Education. According to the latest official data of China, in May this year, the unemployment rate of young people aged 16 to 24 rose to 20.8%, which has set a record high since two consecutive months in 2018. Among them, the situation of college graduates is even worse. According to Zhuo Xian, a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council of the State Council of China, the unemployment rate of college students is 1.4 times that of the overall unemployment rate of young people. No job. China ’s online“ full -time children ”have become hot spots. The so -called“ full -time children ”is to obtain living expenses by taking care of their parents. The reason behind it is the unemployment rate of China’ s high ownership, which indicates the current situation of serious decline and atrophy of the entire socioeconomic economy.</p>
<p>Since the middle of the last century, the university has claimed to cultivate the middle class cradle. After graduating from university, it is equivalent to getting an access certificate entering the social ascension channel. Today, graduation of university is unemployed, indicating that the middle class dream is broken.</p>
<p><strong> The middle class becomes "three slaves" (house slave, car slave, child slave) </strong></p>
<p>China's middle class almost emptied all the financial resources, so that they had enough down payment to buy a house and became "house slaves". What is the pressure of Chinese mortgages? The national people owe 6.682 trillion yuan, and interest more than 40%"(NetEase, 2022-08-01) This article mentioned that according to data released by the central bank at the end of 2021, the total number of personal housing loans in the country was 3.83 trillion yuan," the book is the same as the book, "the even book is the book," even the book, "Interest" calculated that the people across the country owed 6.682 trillion debts and interesting more than 40%, which is equivalent to the total amount of GDP of 300 SMEs throughout the year. According to data released by the People's Bank of China in 2020, the scale of Chinese residents' loans reached 63.3 trillion yuan, of which the total amount of medium and long -term loans was about 4.08 trillion yuan, mainly for housing mortgage loans and decoration loans. 100 million households. During the period of the epidemic, there were many people who broke the supply due to unemployment.</p>
<p>The middle class is not only a house slave, but also a car slave. Since the implementation of the "New Deal of Automobile Loan", which can buy a car on January 1, 2017, the car credit has become the second consumer credit business. Sub -purchase of house purchase loans. The data cited by the People's Daily · Overseas Edition (September 15, 2022) shows that the proportion of families in China has reached 41.67%, and 81.4%of the family car prices of car families are less than 200,000 yuan, indicating The four families are barely buying a car. Since 2020, an epidemic has made the post -90s "monthly owe clan" appearing in the original form, and it is difficult to repay the car and sell cars. ("People's Daily · Overseas Edition", April 15, 2020)</p>
<p>The middle class that has been married and childcare is also called "child slave". It is used to summarize and describe all his life to work hard for children, busy for children, earn money for children, and lose the living state of self -worth. The state of becoming a "child slave" is different, which is related to parents' expectations for their children. In "Why children will become the biggest burden of new middle -class families" (Sina Education, May 20, 2017) Good education has many expectations of the new middle class of studying abroad: Based on children's 12 years of basic education, it costs about 2 million yuan in private schools. It costs about 2 million yuan in four years of undergraduate in Western countries such as the United States. There are 4 million yuan in tuition reserves, which means that each middle -class family must have 250,000 yuan per year as a tuition reserve. Therefore, the annual income of the family must last at least 600,000-800,000 years in order to barely meet this demand. Most of the food and clothing families have completed basic education in public schools. After going to college, they have seen the situation of the school. The 4 -year cost ranges from 100,000 to 400,000. ("How much does it cost to go to college? 100,000, 200,000, 400,000, the higher the admission score line, the more money, the more money" (NetEase July 26, 2021)</p>
<p>The above situation shows that the gap between the "child slave" is determined by the income gap between the middle -class households.</p>
<p><strong> The revenue standard for the middle class is decreased </strong></p>
<p>The concept of "middle class" is still very vague in China. Foreign investment bank reports are different from China's estimates, and China is different in different years.</p>
<p>In a report in 2015, Credit Suisse said: Based on the US $ 50,000 to 500,000 as the benchmark, the IMF version of the purchasing power parity (PPP) was converted. He is a member of the middle -class army. It is specifically stated here that personal wealth includes all real estate, stocks, deposits, etc., does not refer to annual income. According to this standard, there are more than 100 million middle classes in China, which is the largest country in the world in the world, but it accounts for only about 10%of the total population.</p>
<p>The investigation conclusions of Chinese research institutions are different. In 2015, the China Family Financial Survey and Research Center of Southwest University of Finance and Economics calculated data based on the CHFS survey of the year that the number of Chinese middle class was actually 204 million people, far exceeding 109 million people who reported the report of Creditses Wealth. Moreover, the total wealth of the middle class in China is 2.83 trillion, surpassing the United States and Japan, and jumping for the world's first place. Since then, the number of middle class has been increasing. The 2020 "Social Blue Book" published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences explains that the annual income of Chinese middle -income families is more than 100,000 yuan. According to this definition, the population of the middle -income family is 400 million. For three years since the end of 2019, the number of unemployed has increased, and the income of Chinese people has decreased, but the number of middle -class people is increasing. According to the report of Tencent Finance on June 18 this year, Li Shi, a senior professor at Zhejiang University, Dean of Sharing and Development Research Institute of Zhejiang University, said that in 2022, the scale of middle -income groups in China reached 460 million people, and 3,000 yuan per month reached a middle -income group. Standards.</p>
<p>——The middle -class standard in 2015 is wealth, not annual income, but including annual income. The caliber is different and cannot be compared. In 2020, the annual income of household income is 100,000 yuan, two jobs of the family of three, with a per capita of 50,000 yuan, and monthly income of more than 4,000 yuan. The middle -class standard is reduced from 4,000 yuan to 2022 monthly income of 3,000 yuan. The standard is lowered. 25%.In other words, the middle class that is just enough for food and clothing accounts for more than half of the middle class.</p>
<p><strong> olive society has become a human past </strong></p>
<p>After World War II, the United States (to the Western countries) because of the leading world economic leadership of technological innovation, the United States became a "rich society" and formed the first -time -dominated olive society in the history of human history After globalization, this olive social structure has become the goal of pursuing modernization in developing countries such as China. As long as the Internet information is checked, it will be found that since 2000, articles about middle -class articles are sweaty. Regardless of the social role of the middle class, regardless of the revenue (wealth) standard of the middle class, or from the perspective of the number of people, China is now atrophic, which shows that China is getting farther and farther from the olive social structure.</p>
<p>However, the number of middle class in the United States is also shrinking. A analysis of Pew ResearchCenter shows that in 1971, 61 % of American adults were considered to belong to the middle class. In 2013, the number of people in the United States in the United States is less than half of the national population. This number responses to 50 %. At present, Americans who believe that they belong to the middle class are less than before. Berkeley economists said that from March to mid -October 2022, the average wealth of 40 % of the middle class with a population of the United States has fallen by 7 %, which is equivalent to a reduction of about 27,000 US dollars. Since the global financial crisis in 2008, this degree of decline has been the first time, which is not huge. According to the current rate of inflation and rising house prices in the United States, the population that meets the standards of middle -class will only be less and less. In the United States, the state of economic state is inferior to the United States. The middle class is basically atrophic. As a global economic engine that has been globalized in the past 20 years, the difficulty of the middle class is part of the huge landscape painting of global economic shrinking.</p>

<p>The French General Administration of Military Army said in a statement: "This test flight is a long -term trajectory that requires very high demands, which represents unprecedented technical challenges, which will also pave the way for the future planning of high -speed weapons in my country."</p>
<p>The French General Administration of Army did not provide details about the results of the test flight, but only stated that the information collected during the test flight was analyzed.</p>
<p>In 2019, France packed the management of the VMAX project to Arianegroup, a VMAX project. The purpose of the plan was to develop a polar speed gliding vehicle demonstration machine.</p>
<p>Polar speed gliding vehicles are a powerless motorized aircraft that can fly at a speed of 5 or higher.

<h4>Carnival Corp (New York Stock Exchange code: CCL)</h4>
<p>Although the quarterly profit is exceeded, the performance forecast of this year's annual performance prediction is generally strong. The stock price of cruise company Carnivalcorp fell more than 7 % overnight, becoming the worst shares in the overnight standard and the Pur 500 index. Before the performance was announced, the stock also achieved the maximum monthly increase in more than two years.</p>
<p>According to CarnivalCorp's second quarter as of the second quarter of this year, the group's net loss from US $ 1.83 million in the same period last year, that is, a loss of $ 1.61 per share, narrowed to 407 million US dollars, that is, a loss of 0.32 per share of 0.32 Dollar. If you do not count non -recurring projects, the loss per share is 0.31 US dollars per share, which is more predicted than analysts collected by FactSet, that is, a loss of $ 0.34 per share.</p>
<p>The performance report also shows that CARNIVALCORP's turnover has increased by 104.5 %, reaching a record of $ 4.91 billion, which is better than the average prediction of FACTSET analysts. Among them, the revenue of the tour tickets soared by 144.4 %, reaching $ 3.14 billion. The income on the cruise ship increased by 58.6 % to US $ 1.77 billion. CARNIVALCORP's cruise closure rate has increased from 69 % year -on -year to 98 % last year.</p>
<p>CarnivalCorp's batching volume of all the future cruise shifts starting this quarter has also reached a record high. Therefore, for fiscal year in 2023, the group's executives have been adjusted from US $ 3.9 billion to US $ 4.1 billion to US $ 4.250 million from the original $ 3.9 billion to $ 4.1 billion.</p>
<p>As for the trend of CarnivalCorp's stock price, the stock reached the highest point of receiving the highest point since June 15 this year. If you do not have a decline overnight, as of last Friday (23rd), the stock has soared 40.7 % since June, which is also the best monthly performance since the stock has soared 43.3 % in February 2021. Since the beginning of the year, this stock has risen by 83.19 %.</p>
<p>As for why the stock's performance exceeded the standard, the stock price fell overnight. Investors have unreasonable expectations for its performance now. If you show me the number of this quarter performance three months ago, I think everyone will excite the 'backflip'. "</p>
<p>Among the 13 analysts of Tipranks, nine were rated "buy" to CarnivalCorp shares, two "held" rating, and two "selling" rating. However, the average target price they give is $ 14.15. In other words, they believe that CARNIVALCORP's stock price may fall 3.08 %.</p>
