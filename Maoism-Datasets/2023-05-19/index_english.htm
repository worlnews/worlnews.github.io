<p>South Korea's largest human rights organization "Gwangju 5.18 Memorial Foundation" was awarded to the Human Rights Award to Zou Xingtong, the vice chairman of the former Hong Kong Branch Federation of Hong Kong. The Secretary -General of the South Korean Human Rights Organization, who was awarded by Zou Xingtong, accepted an exclusive interview with Zou Xingtong. It symbolizes the hope of Hong Kong. He said that his identity was exposed after receiving the prize, or he was banned from Hong Kong and the mainland since then, but he was still fearless. He and Zou Xingtong have known each other for more than ten years. Although in South Korea, "June 4th" will go to the Chinese Embassy to order candles every year. He hopes that Zou Xingtong will be released home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"She is like a candlelight, the hope of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement, so she is qualified to win the Guangzhou Human Rights Award."</p>
<p>"Although I am in South Korea, I want to make a candlelight for her. Before she was released, I would insist on doing the same thing outside the Chinese Embassy every year."</p>
<p>——Dou Xingtong has known each other who has known each other for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The award on behalf of Zou Xingtong is Na Hyun-Phil, headquartered in Seoul, who is headquartered in Seoul and focusing on global human rights issues, "Korean House for InternationalSolidarity). When he spoke, he choked and wrote a word for Zou Xingtong. It mentioned that this award belongs to each Hong Kong person who is free to fight for freedom. "This human rights award represents it. Everyone is with Hong Kong people."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-47-00-04-00/000001.png" />Luo Xianfei received the prize in the last generation of the "Guangzhou 5.18 Memorial Foundation".

<p>Luo Xianfei was interviewed by this station and was asked why Zou Xingtong received the prize on behalf of Zou Xingtong. Luo Xianfei first sighed, saying that Hong Kong people could not come to the scene because of safety reasons. He also focused on the issue of Hong Kong's human rights.</p>

All information is public. This means that the Chinese government will recognize the award -winning person. In order to protect Hong Kong people, they think that I am more suitable as Koreans and can protect her family or friends.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei said that after receiving the invitation, he also thought about it. In the end, he resolutely accepted his mission and was willing to take the risk of banning Hong Kong and the mainland.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei said: Because Chinese officials already know my actions, I don't know. I hope to go to Hong Kong to meet other friends in Hong Kong, but I think the risks are very high. I think of Hong Kong, but I am not sure of the safety of myself and other friends, so I think I will give up this opportunity and no longer go to Hong Kong or China mainland.</p>
<p>** Friends Zou Xingtong held a candlelight to the Chinese Embassy every year after he was prison for release.</p>
<p>On the eve of the "June 4th" anniversary of 2021, the Hong Kong police banned Victoria Garden for the second consecutive year on the grounds of epidemic prevention. Zou Xingtong said that he would commemorate in the "personal name". On the day of the "June 4th", Zou Xingtong was arrested by the Hong Kong police on the grounds that he was "suspected of promoting the collection of unprecedented assembly".</p>
<p>On the day Zou Xingtong was arrested, Luo Xianfei was impressed. He said that after seeing the news that day, he was in Seoul and went to the Chinese Embassy alone to lit the candlelight for Zou Xingtong.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-47-00-04-00/000003.png" />After Zou Xingtong was arrested, Luo Xianfei went to the Chinese Embassy in the Chinese Embassy in the 333rd anniversary of the 64th. (Provided by the respondent) [] <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hk-chow-05182023104009.html/1897ac2f-de5c-437b-9954-68e2d0c276b6.jpg"></a>Luo Xianfei said: I saw the news. Later, a person took a candle to the night outside the Chinese Embassy in Seoul and urged the authorities to release Zou Xingtong. Although I was in South Korea, I wanted to hold a candlelight for her. Last year, "June 4th", I also did the same thing. I took the candle to the night outside the Chinese Embassy. I may have the same action this year. Before she is released, I will insist on doing the same thing every year.</p>
<p><strong> Knowing with Zou Xingtong for nearly 12 </strong> <strong> Years refer to her "Heart Chinese Democratic Movement" </strong></p>
<p>Luo Xianfei and Zou Xingtong met for nearly 12 years. The two met for the first time. At a joint meeting in Taiwan in 2011, they discussed the issue of labor rights and interests with representatives of human rights organizations in other countries. Zou Xingtong was an initiator of Chinese labor rights and interests in the early days. Before Zou Xingtong became a lawyer, the two had a friendship and met in Hong Kong or South Korea. Luo Xianfei described that Zou Xingtong was a good friend and was impressed by her.</p>
<p>Luo Xianfei said: She is a very sincere person and is very interested in workers. She insists on doing the right thing. It is very principled to be a person, that is, as long as she thinks it is the right thing, she will put it into action. She was really enthusiastic and held a candlelight event for the Tiananmen incident. She was proud of being able to hold a candlelight rally in Hong Kong. I was very impressed.</p>
<p>** It is difficult to study the issue of Hong Kong after disintegrating the National Security Law of Hong Kong.Luo Xianfei said: There is no action on Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is currently a silent society, we can't find a way to fight for Hong Kong democracy. But in any case, we will observe the situation in Hong Kong and hope to find a way.</p>
<p>Although the center of gravity is shifted, Luo Xianfei has paid attention to the disintegration of Hong Kong's citizens. It is a pity that Hong Kong Labor Organization has contributed to improving labor rights and interests from all over the world. He remembered that at that time, the Workers' Alliance had spoiled the topic of South Korean workers, including the South Korean consulate in Hong Kong in 2016 to protest the Korean government's arrest of the chairman of the Democratic Labor and Labor of South Korea and demanded to release all members of the arrest and cancellation of control.</p>
<p><strong> "Zou Xingtong is like a candlelight, the hope of the Democratic Movement in Hong Kong" </strong></p>
<p>Three Chinese consulate members had previously requested the organizer "Guangzhou 5.18 Memorial Foundation" to withdraw the Human Rights Award to Zou Xingtong, which was eventually rejected by the organizer. Luo Xianfei believes that the visit of Chinese officials even proves that Zou Xingtong's award is the correct decision, and it also makes the human rights award more meaningful, reflecting the organizer only focuses on human rights and does not accept political suppression, and the incident also stimulates more Koreans' support for Zou Xingtong.</p>
<p>Regarding Zou Xingtong's award, Luo Xianfei believed that she was deserved, and her award also symbolized Hong Kong's hope.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-18T10-47-00-04-00/000004.png" />Luo Xianfei urged the authorities to release Zou Xingtong as soon as possible.

<p>In the end, Luo Xianfei made a message to Hong Kong people saying: "The Koreans have not forgotten Hong Kong, we will support the Hong Kong democratic movement."</p>
<p>Zou Xingtong was selected as the "2023 Guangzhou Human Rights Award" winner in early May. It was the first time that Hong Kong people won this award. The Evaluation Committee described Zou Xingtong with the "human rights lawyer of democratic movement and democratic struggle", and also pointed out that Zou Xingtong was awarded to Zou Xingtong as "resisting the anti -democracy of the Hong Kong government and the courage and hope of human rights activities and citizens around the world."</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany) China has canceled its ban on Australian wood for more than two years from Thursday (May 18). This is another sign of the bilateral relations that restore the damage of the two countries.</p>
<p>After Australia called for an independent investigation of the origin of the new crown virus, wood was included in the official Australian export list of officials and unofficial trade barriers implemented in 2020 in 2020. It is estimated that this prohibition list including coal, wine, barley, beef, seafood, cotton and copper, will cause Australian exports to lose $ 14 billion in each year.</p>
<p>However, since the left -wing Labor Party came to power a year ago and ended the 9 -year Conservative Party in Australia, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中澳關係升溫-澳總理稱願與習近平會面/a-65244199"></a>Essence Australian coal, cotton and copper exports to China have recently recovered.</p>
<p>Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told reporters that the wood ban has been canceled from Thursday because Australian exporters have dispelled China's concerns about quarantine. The official notice has been sent to the Australian government on Wednesday. "So from today, the wood in Australia will return to China."</p>
<p>Don Farrell, Minister of Trade in Australia [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳大利亚贸易部长今起访华-恢复贸易是会谈重点/a-65591021"></a>It aims to find a trade barrier of trade barriers, especially for Australian wine and barley.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Australian Foreign Minister Pennywong welcomed the restoration of wood trade with China. Before the ban was promulgated, the transaction reached $ 1 billion per year. "We are happy with this progress." Huang Yingxian said at a joint press conference held at a joint press conference with Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo during his visit to Manila. "We really believe that eliminating these trade obstacles is beneficial to both parties." <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澳外长在北京愿促两国明智地处理分歧/a-64178269"></a>Australian Finance Minister Jimchalmers said that China's decision to cancel the wood ban is a step ahead of the goal of stable economic relations between China and Australia. "This is a vital market for us. We hope to stabilize this relationship. Welcome to make any progress in canceling trade restrictions." Chammer told reporters.</p>
<p>The Australian Limelin Products and Paper Industry Association also welcomed China's decision. Joelfitzgibbon, CEO of the association, said in a statement, "When the ban took effect more than two years ago, it brought huge turbulence and uncertainty to many wood exporters and other forestry departments. We welcome This decision. "</p>
<p>China is the largest trading partner in Australia, with a total bilateral trade of 287 billion US dollars last year.</p>
<p>In April, Australia withdrew appealed to the World Trade Organization on the barley ban in China. In return, China agrees to re -consider the decision to impose 80%tariffs on Australian grains. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/关系改善-中澳将谈判解决大麦争端/a-65277773"></a>(Associated Press)</p>

<p>Today, May 18, 2023. Mr. Wu Yan, who is "super vulgar butcher", has lost his freedom on May 19, 2015 to defend human rights and promote social progress. He experienced torture, refused to compromise, and was sentenced to eight years of evil sentences for eight years of "subversion of state power". The days when countless freedoms are lost to today: Wu Yan has carried 2921 days, today is the day he returned to his family and friends!</p>
<p>"Freedom of Wu Yan!Also all conscience offenders are free!No guilt for speech, long live freedom!" It is the voice of countless Chinese people!</p>
<p>As the butcher Wu Yan returned from a small prison to the day of the prison, with the sunset of the past day, the countdown to the continuous approach finally counted "he has carried 2921 days". In addition to changes, the text has also changed from "how many days there is still a day to return to my family and friends" to "Today is the day when I return to my family and friends!"</p>
<p>The above -mentioned text, with Wu Yan every day ... The countdown of the net name "Super Vulgar Butcher" appears on social media. Eight years have passed. Sister Wang Lizhen insisted on using this countdown to remind everyone to pay attention to human rights defenders. How many eight years can people have a lifetime? Intersection</p>
<p>Looking back at history, how many hero heroes have a better call for this land that has been applied to the communist spell, and they have paid the best youth and even life in their lives!</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the heroes of the "killing pigs" went: whether it is Guangdong, Fujian, Beijing, Northeast, or Shandong, Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi ... It can be said that it was a era of "killing pigs" to show great power!The "pig killing" model not only reveals the evil and lies of the communist autocracy, but also through the details of many hot cases to enlighten and awaken countless people who are deeply damaged by the communist red poison. "Sheepskin" was revealed in front of the Chinese.</p>
<p>However, the Communist bandits mastered the two tools of maintenance of lies and violence. After the lies were revealed invalid, the CCP used violence to arrest Wu Yan into the black prison and use torture. , Butcher Wu Yan refused to compromise and plead guilty. Later, he was sentenced to eight years by the CCP and was sent to the prison for detain. This is another best examples of studying the CCP and the people as the enemy who always stand on the evil side.</p>
<p>Today, the butcher has been in prison for eight years and finally walked out of the prison of the Communist Party. We lamented that life like a white horse for eight years, and countless people who are willing to be willing to take care of their righteousness are not afraid of danger. In order to promote social progress and maintain fairness and justice, how many youthful or even life has been paid!</p>
<p>In addition to sigh, we must make a clear strategic planning on how to lift the CCP's curse in its falling area, and tactically think about how to achieve democratic republics and the constitutional rule of law. Because only by completely breaking the communist autocracy of people can we usher in a free and fair tomorrow.</p>
<p>It broke the propaganda of the CCP's lies and lifted the CCP's violent armed forces. It was like breaking the left arm of the Communist regime. At that time, we could freely move forward and build a beautiful life with human rights and freedom. It is believed that with the retreat of the Warriors buttons, with the joint efforts of people of insight in all walks of life, the "Pig Killing Book" is expected to target tyranny, relieve its armed forces, and usher in the major vitality of Chinese democracy and then show its power.</p>
<p>As long as we work together, we will be able to see that the heroes gather to relieve the Communist curse and the law of democratic republic and the constitutional rule of law.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse Washington, 18th) The U.S. Republican Right -Right -right signal shows that they will not be soft to the requirements of large cuts, but the Federal House Speaker Kevin McCarthy still said today that he sees the avoidance of debt defaults. The talks have a "way" to make breakthroughs.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-19T-23-02-08-00-00/000000.png" />The U.S. government is expected to reach the upper limit of the statutory debt on June 1st, which makes the world's largest economy owed 31.8 trillion US dollars debt and triggers the possibility of turbulence in the global market.</p>
<p>"We haven't reached that point yet, and we haven't agreed with anything, but I see that we can reach a consensus." This is after his Republicans and Democratic President Biden of Congress raised the upper limit of debt and fell into a deadlock. The most optimistic evaluation so far.</p>
<p>He said, "I think we have a structure now, and everyone is working hard to negotiate."</p>
<p>In January this year, McCarthy promised to the Republican Performance Freedomcaucus that Biden had to agree to significantly reduce the federal budget in exchange for their support to increase the upper limit, so they were elected as the Federal House Speaker.</p>
<p>Republican Congress passed the "Limit, Save, Growact) in April, and agreed to raise the upper limit of debt in March 2024, or until the debt reached 31.9 trillion US dollars, but because of this bill Weaken the important part of the Biden's Political Plan and has not passed the Federal Senate that has not controlled the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Democrats pointed out that the debt limit has been reduced by dozens of times without a budget negotiation, accusing Republicans holding the US economy as "hostage."</p>
<p>Congress leaders held two rounds of talks with Biden, but to promote the bill in Congress before the Treasury funds were used out, there is not much time left.</p>
<p>Any agreement reached with the Republicans must be passed by the Senate held by the House of Representatives and the Democratic Party by the Republican Party before the last period. The McCarthy said that it took 11 days to pass the Congress of the Congress.</p>
<p>The Federal House of Representatives will have only 4 days this month, and the senators will enter the MemorialDay dating period of the death of the General. The next time for the next recovery is May 30, but they are told that they may return to Congress in advance.</p>
<p>Some Democratic Federal Senators urged Bayeng to quote Article 14 Amendment (14thamendment) to increase their own debt limits and avoid debt defaults without the approval of Congress. Article 14 of the US Constitution stipulates that "the effectiveness of US public debt ... cannot be questioned."</p>
<p>The former government has discussed the feasibility of this move and is worried that if this operation is challenged in the court, it may destroy full trust and reputation of the United States.</p>
<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris said to the media at another press conference: "Our position is simple and clear: Congress must take action to avoid debt defaults."</p>
<p>"This is more than 70 things that Congress has done since 1960, and it is also what the former government has done three times. The United States must pay its own bills."</p>
<p>The Congressional BudgetOffice said that the "restrictions, savings, and growth bills" can save $ 4.8 trillion in the next 10 years, but Moodyanalytics, a letter of criticism agency, will make the economy in 2024 the economy of 2024. The growth rate decreased by 0.6 percentage points and reduced 780,000 job opportunities.</p>
<p>45 members of the Liberty Party insisted on maintaining their debt limits today and called for the stop of negotiation, showing that McCarthy was persuaded to accept the challenges faced by the Republican right -wing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65666897/65003694"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-19T00-13-00Z/65003694_303.jpg" /></a>The US Congress and the state government have become increasingly alert to TIKTOK, and they are worried that the Chinese government has potential influence on the platform</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The US Montana has completely disabled Tiktok through the bill, prompting 5 Tiktok users and creators to filed a lawsuit with the state court of the state in the state. implement.</p>
<p>Tiktok users believe that the state tries to "exercise the national security power that Montana does not have and prohibit the freedom of speech without the right to suppress the state." It has violated the basic rights guaranteed by the US constitution. Before the deadline, Austinknudsen, the chief prosecutor of Montana, had not responded to Reuters' comment request.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will be submitted to Democratic Judge Donald Mollay; Morro was nominated by the former Democratic President Billclinton in 1995 as a judge. Some Democrats are not tough for Tiktok.</p>
<p>On the 17th, a Tiktok spokesman Brookeoberwetter issued a statement saying that the bill was unconstitutional and "violated the freedom of speech of the people of Montana." She said, "We want to guarantee the people of Montana, and they can continue to use Tiktok to express ourselves, make a living, and join the community, because we continue to work hard to defend the rights of users inside and outside Montana."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-05-19T00-13-00Z/65096240_401.jpg" />In March of this year, the chief CEO of Tiktok went to the US Congress to testify, and the hearing president has been in the past 6 hours.</p>
<p>The first amendment to the US Constitution stipulates that no law formulated by Congress shall violate the basic human rights of citizens, which contains freedom of speech.</p>
<p>In 2020, the then US President Donaldtrump tried to stop downloading Tiktok and WeChat through the norms of the Ministry of Commerce, which was blocked by multiple courts and never took effect.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全盘禁止tiktok-美国民主党内有反对声音/a-65213817)It also supports American users to maintain the right to use Tiktok in order to exercise freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Greg Gianforte, governor of Montana, officially signed legislation on the 17th to prohibit Tiktok from operating in the state, saying that this move will further "protect the Mongolian Mongolian people's surveillance."</p>
<p>After the bill takes effect, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全面禁止tiktok美国蒙大拿州先行一步/a-65333928"></a>Essence Emily Flower, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of Montana, publicly stated on the 17th: "We expect to have legal challenges and have been fully prepared to defend the legal defense."</p>
<p>The ban stipulates that Tiktok will not be downloaded in Montana, which means that applications such as Google and Apple are not allowed to "illegally" to provide TIKTOK. Whenever someone uses TIKTOK, whether it is "providing the ability to use this application" or "download it", TIKTOK or App Store will touch the France, which will face a fine of up to $ 10,000 a day.</p>
<p>The bill is expected to take effect on January 1, 2024, and punishment will not apply to the user.</p>
<h3>Tiktok's ban is feasible?</h3>
<p>The Associated Press quoted an analysis of online security experts. This ban has no incentive measures except for the fines, and no incentive measures make relevant companies willing to comply with regulations, so "full law enforcement will be very difficult."</p>
<p>In addition, compared with China's control of citizens' access to the Internet, the United States does not have any similar means or tools. The decree also excludes online service providers.</p>
<p>A member of the members included a representative of Apple and Google's trade group TechNet that the Associated Press told the Associated Press that the application store was unable to "geographical fence" in specific applications in different states, so it was impossible to prevent Tiktok from being downloaded in Montana. The organization also said that the application itself should decide the running range, not an app store.</p>
<p>Odedvanunu, the product vulnerability director of the Internet Security Corporation, also believes that it is difficult for app stores to isolate the application download of a single country. He suggested that it is more feasible to comply with the rules by Tiktok, because the application itself has the right to "adjust the settings according to the user's geographical location or IP address."</p>
<h3>Disabast</h3>
<h3>American Stepping Tiktok</h3>

However, this Taiwanese drama was removed by Douban.com in mainland China. What are the reasons?</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-04082023162043.html"></a></em></strong><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/pinglun/wangdan/wd-11012021155933.html"><strong> Wang Dan Hot Post: Recommend one to understand the TV series of Taiwan </strong></a>"Candidate-Creator"(The following is called "Candidate")The main line of the plot focuses on the development of the political staff election of the presidential election of Taiwan. The heroine is the member of the presence, and encounters the difficulties of women's politics, sexual harassment, marriage, and diverse families. And this Taiwanese drama has also set off heated discussions on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Although "Candidates" was removed by Douban and could not see any film reviews on a Chinese website, many netizens on Weibo have eagerly published their own look. Someone wrote: "That world is too far away!It feels like people have a feeling of growing up in a blue sky in the cage"; "Although it has built a Chinese utopian, it is certain that it is indeed a simple and simpler. Tour more than one level. "</p>
<p>Some people sighed: "The original word can be said. The original news can write this kind of theme. It turned out that everyone could participate in politics and choose a future they wanted." I just want to say blessing Treasure Island, so that the Chinese world still has some free fires. "</p>
<p>"Democracy is not a do not make mistakes, but can truly correct errors; the core of the election is not offensive and defensive, but to let each participant face themselves sincerely, accept the most extensive view, admit errors and improve, and move forward again." From Chengdu. "From Chengdu The feminist writer Shangguan, who married Taiwan, pointed out on his personal oil pipe channel that the power of "Candidates" is that only a few very important things have been said in 8 episodes. In addition to democracy, politicians will always be. To be softened, arrogance can make people make mistakes; elections are not unable to compromise, but that there must be insistence in compromise, and insistence can also be compromised.</p>
<p><strong> Chinese netizens commented on the political election of "Candidates" are taboo </strong></p>
<p>Relevant comments by netizens have been deleted in the Chinese Internet, and some can still be found online. Some bloggers introduced the plot and told netizens that they had to read; some people chose to cut in in women's issues to avoid sensitive political election topics.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T04-56-00-04-00/000001.png" />"Candidates-Creator" caused heated discussion on Chinese social platforms.(Screenshot from Weibo)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/hcm-05192023045609.html/8a558ad64e0921.jpg"></a>The blogger's "Sister Dragons Online" commented on Sina.com: It is not difficult to guess that this drama will be removed by Douban because of the theme background. Especially after the start of the #METOO movement of the cultural circle, the workplace sexual harassment and female issues in the play have caused fierce discussions. "They use our mother tongue to talk about some very 'normal' words, but we are still shocked. It is really shocking to hear those words in the mother tongue context."</p>
<p>The blogger "from the heart to the movie" pointed out that the reason why the Taiwanese drama "Candidates" was 404(delete)Most of them are the episodes of politicians. He believes that many lines of the play really touch some "nerves", so there is an unspeakable meaning. But in fact, more problems that women encounter in social life and emotional life, so many people resonate with this.</p>
<p><strong> "Candidates" highlights the comparison of democracy and freedom and authoritarian society </strong></p>
<p>After Wu Kunyu, who was once born in a political staff member, left the political circle, starred in Taiwan's first political series "International Bridge Society". The play tells the process of democratization in Taiwan in the 1990s, the battle and pull of the forces of all parties. He mentioned the difficulty of "International Bridge" who wanted to go on the streaming platform but repeatedly bumped into the wall. He said that the subject matter touched former Taiwan President Lee Teng -hui, and the platform did not accept it. He joked that because the subject matter was too sensitive, he couldn't even have a platform, and there was no chance of rebellion.</p>
<p>"The" Candidate "stole a coincidence. Although it is about the election, the topic of the inside or the same marriage issues are all side issues. It avoids it. "Wu Kunyu ordered an important key to international platforms such as" The Candidates ".</p>
<p>Wu Kunyu observed that after watching the show, Wu Kunyu has hotly discussed envy in Taiwan. He also hopes that he can have votes and choose the ideal candidate in his mind. He believes that life is equal and freedom, and he is naturally not in love with others. If you have a joke with a talk show, you will be blocked by 8 words, which is really scary.</p>
<p>"" Candidates "is a strong contrast between democracy and freedom and authoritarian society," he said.</p>
<p><strong> The value of advanced margins such as "marriage" hit the authoritarian authority </strong></p>
<p>"It can be explored for different issues. For different values, you can find a way to talk or even collide. Tolerance is the most precious value of Taiwan. Now there are only Taiwan in the Chinese circle." Du Shengcong interpreted the value of "candidate" in the Chinese world.</p>
<p>Du Shengcong described that "Candidates" is the Governor's DPP in the construction of a soft power to find a model for the framework of pushing Taiwan's image project. For example, in the play, the same -sex partner has become a daily life, showing the main theme of the DPP and the values of progress, which has a collision against the basic core values of the KMT and the Communist Party.</p>
<p><strong> Can Taiwanese dramas be launched in China? </strong></p>
<p>In addition to "Candidates", "I Want to See You" during the epidemic has also become a topic of enthusiastic discussion of Chinese netizens. Recently EssenceReporter: Huang Chunmei Responsible: Chen Meihua Xu Shuting He Ping.com Edited: Ruizhe</p>

Hou Youyi, a Kuomintang candidate, also said: The Republic of China has independent sovereignty. It is both sovereignty and independent, and is not under the jurisdiction of any country nor an affiliated country. The U.S. government also emphasized that the United Nations decision has never denied the sovereignty of the Republic of China. The international and domestic recognition of the sovereignty independence of the Republic of China should not be controversial. Therefore, countries have resolutely opposed to Xi Jinping's martial arts Taiwan, and declare that they will participate in defending Taiwan, that is, a reasonable and legal action program. On the other hand, the Wusong War of the Communist Party of China is unreasonable or legal. The situation seems not good for Xi Jinping. Looking back at the Taiwanese's own independence, it is ridiculous. Many years ago, Mr. Shi Mingde, the predecessor of the Democratic Progressive Party, talked about this irrational. Unity, who are you unified with? Because they couldn't get back to Taiwan, they still couldn't fight. Do you want to be unified by the Communist Party? Neither of the voters and the people of the two parties did not agree. Whether it is with or martial arts, neither does not match public opinion. When it comes to Taiwan independence, it is even more ridiculous. Mr. Shi Mingde also agreed: Taiwan is not under the jurisdiction of the Communist Party of China. It has always been independent. Where should I go out independently? The premise of independence is that it is not independent now, that is, he denys his independence sovereignty. Are you under the jurisdiction of the Communist Party or are it under the jurisdiction of Japan? Isn't this an excuse for the CCP to attack Taiwan? What's more unreasonable. Now that international and domestic recognition, adhering to the independent sovereignty of the Republic of China is the best position for protecting the interests of the people of Taiwan and the international community. Unreasonable disputes of unity should be abandoned. The ambiguous attitude of pretending to be from the international community from commercial interests should also be put away. The dispute between the unification and continuing to be blurred will only cause greater disaster, not in line with the interests of everyone, nor does it meet the interests of the Chinese people, only in the interests of the Communist Party. For the people of the mainland, the people of Taiwan have lived well by themselves. Why should you go to unified people? What are the benefits of unified people for you? People are well done by themselves, and they are richer than you. You want to grab people. Isn't this the logic of robbers? At least it is red eye disease, not very glorious. The pinks who were promoted by Xi Jinping had to think about it. Even if you were successful, Taiwan was destroyed. What can I get? It can only be sanctions and besieged by the world, the economy has further declined, and life is more difficult. Don't say that you can return to the Stone Age, at least back to the liberation of the liberation at least overnight. Do you want to? Are your children willing? Don't think about others, at least think about yourself. Little people usually do not care about politics, and follow others blindly. But do you understand the adults who eat political meals? Why do they have a lot of money than to pay attention to the tail than the monkey? Then we have to look at the conspiracy they hid behind. There is a reason for everything, there is behind the stage, there is the benefits of others without your benefits. According to the principle of Holmes: whoever has benefits is suspicious. Mobilizing war can resolve internal contradictions, which is a common means of politicians since ancient times. Who is caught in inside and outside the inside and outside, and can't extricate yourself? It seems to be the Communist Party and Comrade Xi Jinping. A war will mobilize the fanaticism of nationalism, improve the people's tolerance for suffering, and unreasonable elimination of political opponents will also be accepted by the public. The above and many benefits to those who have power are needed by politicians who have internal and external difficulties. Sacrifice the interests of the people of Taiwan, sacrifice the interests of the people of the mainland, and put Taiwan and the people of the mainland together in a disaster, just for the interests of a small number of Communist Party bureaucrats. This is really not worth it. After knowing this interest, don't follow the propaganda of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>A news from the website of Songgang Street Office, Baoan District said that just three weeks before the incident, the Songgang Street Trade Union just opened <a href="http://www.baoan.gov.cn/sgjd/zwgk/qt/gzdt/content/post_10517892.html"></a>Chen Jinhua, vice chairman of Baoan District Trade Union, spoke at the meeting, requiring the grassroots trade unions to do their best to do practical things, do good things, and solve difficult things for employees, so as to continuously enhance the sense of perception, response, influence and cohesion of the union.

Why did workers ask for demands and developed to the roof of the floor at once? Have the workers looking for help before going to the roof? After the incident, did the local unions say what the chairman said at the union congress "bright brand and bright identity" to give full play to the union perception, response, influence and cohesion. Representatives of workers negotiated with corporate negotiations to solve problems?</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-05-19T11-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Due to the worries about the Chinese economy, the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets fell.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of long negotiations at Capitol Hill, Congress leaders seem to propose a proposal to Congress members before the government triedmed cash on June 1.</p>
<p>This also drives the rise of the three main indexes of Wall Street, continuing an increase of more than 1%on the 17th.</p>
<p>In Asia, although the data shows that Japan's inflation is still much higher than the goals of the Bank of Japan and the pressure of increasing the central bank's tightening monetary policy, the Tokyo stock market has risen again today, and the Nikkei index has soared to a new high of more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Mumbai, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Jakarta have also risen.</p>
<p>Stepheninnes, an analyst of SPI Asset Managemen (SPI Asset Managemen), said: "Although there is no formal signing agreement, the policy maker in Washington claims to increase the upper limit of US debt limits may appear next week. It's enough to make investors cheer. "</p>
<p>However, the Hong Kong stock market fell more than 1%because the income announced by the e -commerce giant Alibaba Group was lower than expected. This exacerbated investors' concerns about China's economic and consumer demand, which caused a sharp decline in technology stocks.</p>
<p>The Shanghai stock market has also fallen, and investors are paying attention to whether the People's Bank of China has launched any new stimulating economic measures after a series of economic data that is lower than expected.</p>

China also showed the actual advanced weapons, which caused the concerns of neighboring countries such as Vietnam to worry about regional security.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/cm-04122023095051.html"><strong> Who is a good Chinese friend in Southeast Asian? </strong></a>According to the English group of this station, from May 9th to May 28th, China and Laos held a joint military exercise called "Friendship Shield-20123". The exercise is based on the background of "cracking down on multinational armed criminal groups" and organized the "Mountains and Jungle Positions for Attack". A total of more than 900 people have participated in their strengths, including about 200 Chinese active teams and 700 Laos soldiers.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of National Defense stated that the exercise aims to "implement the joint statement on further deepening the construction of the old destiny community in China", and the relevant content on strengthening the cooperation of defense and safety cooperation, consolidating and developing the comprehensive strategic partnership between the old and the development of the old and the old and the old and the old and the old strategic partnerships ","</p>
<p>A brief news from the official CCTV on the 17th shows that Laos participated in a light weapon provided by China such as fast pistols, multi -functional rifles, and remote sniper rifles under the guidance of Chinese instructors, and fired real bombs. In addition, the Chinese official media has also reported on the same day that this is the first time that the old officers and soldiers have experienced and learned a new type of automatic rifle developed by China.</p>

He believes that Vietnam has always been Laos's largest traditional allies, but in recent years, Vientia Move closer to China.</p>
<p>China has always regarded Laos as the export market for military fire equipment, but Laos did not reach a large military purchase agreement with China due to lack of funds. Most weapons and military equipment used by the Laos army are still from the former Soviet Union and Russia.</p>
<p>According to Xinhua News Agency, in April 2017, Beijing presented a batch of "office equipment" to the Laos Ministry of Defense. The outside world suspects that these may be national defense equipment. In November of the same year, Vientiane announced a million US dollars of contracts, agreed to purchase weapons from northern China. Since Laos did not further disclose the details of the contract, whether the transaction was finally reached, the outside world could not be known.</p>
<p>According to reports, China provided the new version of the 191 assault rifle with Laos' joint military exercises. Compared with the previous 95 rifle, its weight is lighter and has a longer service life. It is reported that the first appearance of the 191 -type rifle was on the 70th anniversary of the founding of China in 2019. This model rifle has also recently invested in the army of the Xinjiang Military Region.</p>
<p>However, Xu Zhixiang, a senior researcher of the PLA's ground equipment specializing in the PLA's ground equipment, told the station that he did not think that the new Chinese rifle has a great advantage. The assault rifle is not much different from the previous 95 type. It is not yet possible to determine whether the rifle will be provided to Laos.</p>
<p>Yan Wende told the English group that the rifle made in China is a light weapon. The price is low. The Laos army can buy it, but it will not "change the overall situation." The PLA "knows what Laos needs, and the cost of light weapons and maintenance costs is low."</p>
<p>He analyzed that if the Laos military needs more advanced equipment, China can simply place Laos under its defense umbrella: "Missiles and radars can simply transfer to Laos through the debt leasing agreement, and it will be operated by Chinese technicians in Laos. ","</p>
<p>Although the official media of Vietnam did not report this time and the old military exercise, Vietnam's military analysts have always kept close attention to the development of the situation.</p>
<p>Vietnam used to be the only military allies in Laos. The two countries signed the National Defense Treaty in September 1977, and the firm connection between the two communist regimes dates back to the 1975 Vietnam War. But with the expansion of China's economic influence, China and Laos's partnerships are deepening.</p>
<p>An anonymous Hanoi observer told this station that although Laos holds a large number of military equipment made in China, its quality is not high.</p>
<p>Khangvu, an analyst at Boston College in the United States, told the Vietnamese group: "This military exercise may make Laos further move closer to China. To strengthen defense cooperation between China and Laos, it will also weaken Vietnam and Laos' defense relationship."</p>

<p>This morning, a Russian class flew from Moscow to Tobei for the first time in four years. The Georgia Opposition Oath vowed to hold protests at the airport.</p>
<p>Lasha Sigua, a 20 -year -old student, said: "We will attend. Russia is launching a brutal war against Ukraine. We must watch Georgia and Russia keep normal."</p>
<p>Georgia, located in South Gaoco, was the Soviet Union to join the Republic. For many years, it has worked closely to the West and has a tense relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>In 2008, a brief but bloody war broke out in Russia and Georgia. After the war, Moscow recognized two separate regions in northern Georgia as an independent country and deployed military bases there.</p>
<p>To this end, Tbilixi held anti -Russian rally, and Russia banned flights with Georgia in 2019.</p>
<p>But last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly announced the lifting of the ban on Georgeia, and at the same time launched a 90 -day visa -free system for George Asia citizens.</p>
<p>Puting's decision aroused the complex emotions of Georgia. After many years of tension, the criticism of the Georgian people continued to intensify the government and accused the authorities of cooperation with the Russian government.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, hundreds of Georgia people had taken the streets to protest the recovery of the two countries.</p>
<p>Analyst Gela Vasadze said that Panting's approach was "part of Hybrid War", which aims to destroy the relationship between Georgia and the West.</p>
<p>But George's Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili welcomed the reunion, saying that it was Pavilion's "very positive decision from a humane perspective."</p>

<p>Hong Kong's political cartoonist Zunzi was suddenly suspended in the Ming Pao's 40 -year -old column. The Ming Pao did not stated whether it was related to Zunzi's criticism of the Hong Kong Government's senior officials in the past six months. Zunzi accepted the response incident of this interview with this station. He acknowledged that it was because of political pressure that "Zunzi Comic" was stopped.</p>
<p>Zunzi: "Of course it is political pressure, it will not be too low, so that I will no longer continue to draw. This time it is obviously related to the political situation, but the publication column must be suspended. When they do not have a task, they will be relatively loose, but at tight time, they will be blamed at every time, and even small things will use a magnifying glass to see it, everything can be guilty.

<p>He believes that the stopping of "Zunzi Comics" caused a big response to the society because the incident reflected the freedom of remarks and expressions in Hong Kong, and the speed and degree of tightening were faster than expected and stricter.</p>
<p>After his work on the public library bookshelf was suspended in the column and was removed at the same time, would he worry that he would be worried that he would be committed to the "National Security Law" hat. Zunzi said that after the "National Security Law" There are no reasonable events that can happen, and it is difficult to judge the previous road.</p>
<p>Zunzi: "They (government) feel that these books have an impact on society or people, and do not want the public to be affected. This kind of action is like cleaning and cleaning. For example ", People are gone, and it doesn't make sense to get his books. For the people on the ban on the book, when you want to sue you, you can't escape. It depends on the effect of society. At this time, it is difficult to make judgments. Whether the authorities will have further regulation. "</p>
<p><strong> Officially suppressing satirical comics and talk show: It is difficult for those who are in power to accept authority and challenge </strong></p>
<p>Hong Kong's political comics and Chinese talk shows have all become the objects of suppression of power. Zunzi believes that comics are just an expression, and the problem is that the official is difficult to accept that authority is ironic and challenged.</p>
<p>Zunzi: "Comic is not a problem. The problem lies in the irony technique. It is difficult to accept that they (those in power) are related to irony. Because they want to build their own image or authority, all funny and jokes in disguise, or causing them to be ridiculed. In the case, they all want to minimize as much as possible. It will be too annoying and the effect to deal with it in a reasonable manner. Even if the means of use is very rude in the eyes of the average person, but from their practical perspective, this is You can be accepted by rude, and you can continue to be rude in the future.

The former military capital Hiroshima has now become a symbol of peaceful cities in the minds of the Japanese</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) On the morning of May 19, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/澤連斯基或將現身廣島-親臨21日g7峰會/a-65673473"></a>The Prime Minister Kishida and Mrs. Yuzi stood in front of the Peace Memorial Park and welcome leaders from various countries. Kishida Wenxiong personally took the leaders of various countries to visit the museum. The various items displayed by the guide and explained, the time reached about 40 minutes. The leaders of various countries talked to the victims of the nuclear explosion and presented flowers in front of the monument.</p>

However, the difference is [] <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/历史性访问奥巴马为广岛献上花圈/a-19289744"></a>Only for about 10 minutes, only watching a few exhibits on the first floor of the lobby.

Today's Hiroshima is a symbol of peace cities in the minds of the Japanese.

<h3>50 years ago, Hiroshima was a "military capital"</h3>
<p>Hiroshima's army starts, and it can be mentioned that it is during the Meiji Restoration period. In 1873, the Grand Japanese Empire set up six major town and Taiwan military camps. Hiroshima was one of them, and soon it was changed to the 5th Division Command. In the following 20 years, Japan's modern military power grew rapidly. During the Sino -Japanese Sino -Japanese War, Hiroshima became the dispatch base of the army at that time. The coalition forces fighting with the Daqingshui Division that year was sent from Yu Pinang.</p>
<p>Yuba Island is a small island on the south of Hiroshima. Because it is located in the Seto Inland Sea, the terrain is easy to defend and difficult to attack. The island's Urpot Port gradually became the focus of empire training at that time. The Japanese army only spent two weeks to build the railway to connect Yu Pin Island, and continued to transport troops to the Korean Peninsula, mainland China and other. The capital is full of first -level dignitaries.</p>
<p>Later, the military began to strengthen infrastructure across Hiroshima, and build military water supply and power systems to ensure the safety and stability of military strength. In the 1900 Boxer Chaos and the Japanese and Russian War in 1905, Hiroshima has become the main place for Japan to send troops. Manual driver.</p>
<p>As the September 18th incident occurred, the Sino -Japanese War broke out. Hiroshima's military role is becoming more and more important. In addition to Yupin in Hiroshima County, other places such as Wu Shi have also become important military ports and counties in the county.</p>
<p>In the end of World War II, Hiroshima carried out a large amount of evacuation, but at this time Hiroshima has become a military town that must be attacked in the eyes of the U.S. military. On August 6, 1945, the U.S. military voted at the atomic bomb. Hiroshima became the first nuclear explosion in human history. city ​​of.</p>

<h3>From the time of the war, it became a natural attraction</h3>
<p>Facing the hometown of the hometown in the past, the atomic bomb was hit hard, and Kishida was not easy to feel deeply in his childhood, and he was resolutely opposed to nuclear weapons. <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/自民党新总裁岸田文雄有哪些内政外交主张/a-59351403"></a>Essence When the outbreak of Russia and Ukraine and the use of Nuclear weapons, the fear of people's nuclear weapons emerged again.</p>
<p>After World War II, Yu Pin Island put aside the rich battlefield color in the past and gradually transformed into passenger use and ordinary fishing port. Residents have also approached 10,000 people to about 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Once, the former island, Aoki, who once lived in the local island, said in an interview with Japan's "Daily News" that he returned to Yu Pin's hometown after the nuclear explosion, and saw that the whole island had become a scorched earth. There were many burnt and painful pains nearby nearby. After the injured people, after waiting for their pain and dying, the living people pushed their bodies on the steel barrel and burned. The smell of smell so far still makes him unforgettable.</p>
<p>At that time, the Military Fortune Port, now the place where the G7 leaders shook hands, including the United States who dropped the atomic bomb that year. For Kishida Wenxiong, as well as Hiroshima, and even every Japanese, Hiroshima was attacked by nuclear bombs as like every generation. Most of the locations on the island now become parks and native forests. The island's viewing historical sites and natural plant walks have become the source of the current financial source.</p>
<p>However, now, the threat of military expansion of Russia's nuclear weapons and China's military expansion still allows the international situation at any time to move the whole body. At this time, again reviewing the journey of Hiroshima from the army to a peaceful city that year, maybe you can once again understand the idea of Kishida Vancouver resort to the "Nuclear Martial Arts World", because for many Hiroshima people, many memories are still vividly remembered.</p>

<p>Yu Maochun pointed out that due to the Cold War thinking, Beijing is very sensitive to Central Asia because it believes that several important border areas around China have been blocked by the West, and Central Asia is a very important breakthrough. In addition, China also has opportunities to think. Yu Maochun said: "Russia traditionally has a huge influence on the region, but now Russia is not in the heart and is deeply trapped in the Ukrainian quagmire. Therefore, the CCP took advantage of the fire and wanted to pull the original sphere of influence that belonged to Russia to its own sphere of influence."</p>
<p>However, Yu Maochun believes that China's speculative methods cannot last long, because China emphasized investment and construction from the perspective of economic interests, and it is difficult to have difficulty in the fundamental values and political cooperation with Central Asian countries, and even in counter -terrorism. Reach an agreement. Therefore, in the long run, China will not have much impact on this area.</p>

<p>Cambodia's opposition leader Sanglixi refers to the general election of Cambodia two months later, and it is a "false scam."</p>
<p>Reuters reports that Sam Rainsy, who is self -exiled overseas on Friday (May 19) in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, attended a event on Southeast Asian press freedom.</p>
<p>When Sanglixi spoke at the event, it was said that the national election in Cambodia would be a "fake election" in July, because the reasons were simple, because there was no opposition party to participate in this election.</p>
<p>Sanlixi said that Cambodia is actually promoting the "one -party system".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Cambodia's only Candle Candle Party was accused of not being properly submitted to the election document.</p>
<p>The Cambodian Election Commission issued a statement on Monday, announcing the cancellation of the eligibility of the candlelight party to participate in the national election on July 23. This means that in the election, the ruling party Cambodia People's Party has almost no opponents. Social movements and diplomats warned that Hun Sen, who has long been the Prime Minister for a long time, may undermine the democratic process of Cambodia.</p>
<p>Sanglixi called on democratic countries on Friday, not to acknowledge the legitimacy of Cambodian elections and Hunson, a long -term Prime Minister of Cambodia.</p>
<p>Reuters tried to find a comment from the Cambodian government, but failed to contact the Cambodian government spokesman immediately.</p>
<p>Santali is the leader of the party -saving party party in Cambodia. In November 2015, Santianxi was charged with slander and inciting social turmoil, and he was exiled to France afterwards. The Cambodian Supreme Court dissolved before the July 2018 election.</p>
<p>The 7th Cambodian election will be voted on July 23.</p>

So, what impact will this initiative have on the three parties of the United States, China, and Taiwan? Is Taiwan expected to reduce its dependence on China's economy?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/hcmwu-05182023225229.html"><strong> "Taiwan -American 21st Century Trade Initiative" signed the first batch of agreements in the next few weeks </strong></a>The U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) recently announced that the United States and Taiwan have completed the first part of the "US Taiwan 21st Century Trade Initiative" negotiations. In the first part of the negotiations, the two parties of the United States reached a consensus on the five issues including customs management and trade convenience, good legal operations, anti -corruption, domestic rules and regulations, and small and medium -sized enterprises. The two parties will sign the first phase of the agreement in the next few weeks, which will expand the space between the economic interaction and investment expansion between the US -Taiwan Small and medium -sized enterprises.</p>
<p>The Economic and Trade Office of the Taiwan Executive Yuan pointed out that this initiative is the most complete trade agreement signed by the United States and Taiwan since 1979, and it is also an important step for the two parties to sign a bilateral trade agreement (FTA).</p>
<p>American trade representative Katherinetai also said: "This result represents an important progress of strengthening the economic relations of the United States and Taiwan. We look forward to continuing to complete the next negotiations to complete a strong and high standard of trade agreement and assist both parties in response Trade challenges faced in the 21st century.

<p><strong> Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The United States and Taiwan signed a trade initiative against the United States and China "Three Public News" </strong></p>
<p>On Friday, this station favored the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. Taiwan to seek comment on the above -mentioned "Initiative" in the United States and Taiwan. The Chinese embassy told reporters about the relevant statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that day and did not add the content of the comments.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference this Friday: "China has always resolutely opposed the official exchanges between the establishment of diplomatic relations with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the country in Taiwan, including any agreement with sovereign meaning and official nature. The relevant acts seriously violated the three joint communiqués of China and China and the United States, and China expressed serious dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this. "</p>

<p>In the outside world, what kind of political impact will the above -mentioned "Initiative" on the three parties of the United States, China, and Taiwan? Davidkeegan, deputy director of the United States, told reporters in an interview with this station that the "Initiative" demonstrated the deepening of US -Taiwan relations: "I believe that" Initiative "will strengthen the US -Taiwan economic cooperation. In recent years Trends. Like TSMC's investment in the United States, and many American companies have announced their investment in Taiwan, these efforts have deepened the economic relations of the United States and Taiwan. Especially I think that economic security is the key to Taiwan's overall security. Therefore, the "Initiative" can strengthen Taiwan's security ","</p>
<p>Ge Tianhao pointed out that the signing of the "Initiative" can reduce China's economic stress on Taiwan, but to be alert to the spread of fake information through the spread of "initiative" in Taiwan, which is not conducive to Taiwan's remarks: "Reduced China's economic stress on Taiwan's economic stress in Taiwan. The chips have always been the goal of the Tsai government and the US government. I believe that the "Initiative" can help us take a small step forward, but in terms of the scale of cross -strait economic interaction, China still has the ability to pressure Taiwan. At the same time, I am at the same time. It is believed that China will distribute false information about the "Initiative" as much as possible, making people think that the United States is taking advantage of Taiwan. "</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: There are still many issues to be discussed in the U.S. Taiwan "Initiative" </strong></p>
<p>Rileywalters, deputy director of the Hudson Institute of the US Think Tank Hudson Institute, believes that the "Initiative" brings positive progress to the US -Taiwan relation I believe that the "Initiative" can further support the already strong US -Taiwan trade and investment relationship. The first stage of the "Initiative" is a good first step, but there are many matters that need to be negotiated in the United States. It will be more complicated than the first stage, such as the issue of digital trade. I am worried that the two parties may not be able to talk about these issues before the election in Taiwan. "</p>
<p>Walter also said that the passage of the US -Taiwan "Initiative" does not affect the poor cross -strait relations: "Beijing has considered the DPP in the worst direction, and has already begun to implement the means to affect cross -strait trade."</p>
<p>Walter also said that if you want to judge whether the "Initiative" will greatly change Taiwan's supply chain to the US and China chip supply chain, it is still too early.</p>
<p><strong> Scholars: How to affect Taiwan's trade dependence on China depends on different industries </strong></p>
<p>Ding Hongbin, deputy dean of the University of Roland's University of Business School, told the reporter that the signing of the first stage of the "Initiative" was spreading the way for the overall trade of the United States and Taiwan: "We found that many of the past trade negotiations have not been noticed. Things, including the use of smart property rights and trademarks, are one of the competition between state -owned enterprises with foreign countries ... Although the tradition only more than 20 years ago, in the trade negotiations at that time,(What is discussing now)Not the core thing. But now in 2023, these things have become very real, and the first agreement under the US -Taiwan trade initiative is placed in this place. "</p>
<p>Ding Hongbin said that because the first stage of "Initiative" did not touch the tariff problem, it would not have a significant impact on the traditional industry of Taiwan relying on China's labor: "They will continue to rely on the Chinese market and Chinese workers. Of course, China, China The price of workers is rising, and the cost of business in China is also rising. Therefore, when the manufacturing and operation costs in China have risen to Taiwanese businessmen, the degree of trade dependence between China and Taiwan will decrease. "Ding Hongbin also said that the "Initiative" of the United States and Taiwan will reduce the bargaining chip of China's economic coercion on Taiwan's agricultural implementation: "The output of agricultural products is fixed, more exported to the United States, and less exported to China. Therefore, in terms of such industries, It does cause the result of reducing the dependence of China and Taiwan trade. "</p>
<p><strong> Chinese Minister of Commerce will visit Washington next week </strong></p>
<p>A few hours before the first stage of the first stage of negotiations announced the above -mentioned "Initiative" in the United States, the Chinese Embassy in the United States confirmed that the Minister of Commerce of China Wang Wentao will visit the United States next week. He will meet with US Minister of Commerce Ginaraimondo at Washington and meet with US trade representative Daiqi at Detroit.</p>
<p>The reporter of this station believed in the Chinese Embassy in the United States to consult whether the above -mentioned "Initiative" would have an impact on Wang Wentao's trip to the United States? However, in the letter of the Chinese embassy, he did not confirm Wang Wentao's schedule to the United States.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T16-48-00-04-00/000000.png" />Official data show that the population of China's first -tier cities is being lost. The picture shows Beijing street view. Associated Press data chart <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/jingmaorediansaomiao/econ-05192023095443.html/@@stream"></a>Good audience and friends, welcome to listen to the financial and epochs of Liberty Asia, I am Rao Yiming.</p>
<p>Recently China's official statistics show that the population of first -tier cities has increased negatively, and the population of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen has decreased by nearly 280,000. The most noticeable one is that the first population has appeared in Shenzhen for the first time since the establishment of a city in Shenzhen. Since the reform and opening up, first -tier cities have focused on the advantages of resources, manpower, geographical and policy tilt, and can be said to be the engine of China's economic development. What kind of signal does the population of first -tier cities pass on? At the same time, some provincial capital cities have ushered in a net inflow of population, so what does this round of population migration and reshuffle mean for China's future development? The show will discuss the above topics. The guests participating in the discussion are Li Hengqing, an economist in the Maryland Strategy and Information Research Institute in the United States.</p>
<p><strong> Negative growth of the population of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen </strong></p>
<p>Last year, China faced the first negative growth of the population in 60 years. The latest public data of the population in 2022 shows that the population of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen has decreased, of which Shanghai has decreased the most, while the first population of the city has increased negatively since the establishment of the city in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>According to China's official data, the population of Beijing has decreased by 43,000, Shanghai has decreased by 135,400, the resident population in Guangzhou has decreased by 76,500, and Shenzhen has decreased by 19,800, and the total first -tier cities have decreased by about 275,000.</p>
<p>According to the Xi'an China Business Daily, as the first city in China, the population of Beijing has grown negatively for 6 consecutive years and has reduced a total of nearly 120,000. Shanghai also previously proposed to control the scale of population. In 2015 and 2017, negative growth has occurred. The negative growth of Beijing and Shanghai is not surprising, but Shenzhen and Guangzhou have been the two cities with the highest increase in China in the past 10 years. The negative growth of the population seems to mean more turns.</p>
<p>The report also said that the development of the population of the north, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen for more than 20 years can further divide it into two stages. Among them, from 2000 to 2010, it is the golden age of Beijing and Shanghai. With the success of Beijing ’s Austrian and Shanghai Shenbo in 2002, the successful construction of large -scale urban construction has attracted large -scale foreign population.</p>
<p>But entering the second decade of the 21st century, especially after 2014, in order to cope with the increasingly severe metropolitan diseases, Beijing and Shanghai have introduced policies to relieve urban functions and strictly control the population of the city.</p>
<p>In recent years, Beijing has not only moved general manufacturing and polluting enterprises, but also transferred to the regional professional market and logistics centers. Even the central enterprise headquarters, deployment of universities, and key hospitals have become the object of transfer. These evacuated industries and parts were undertaken by Tianjin and Hebei, and some of them were settled in the newly established Xiong'an New District.</p>
<p>At the same time, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, which are also first -tier cities, opened the door one after another to welcome people from all directions, so they took over from Beijing and Shanghai and began to lead the population growth. During the ten years from 2000 to 2010, the population of Guangshen increased by about two or three million, less than half of Beijing and Shanghai, but by 2020 in 2010, it suddenly increased to six or seven million. The high -speed increase in this period is the same.</p>
<p>However, this rapid growth momentum ended abruptly in 2021. The population increase in Guangzhou decreased from 430,000 in 2020 to 70,000, while Shenzhen has plummeted from 530,000 in 2020 to less than 50,000. Last year, it was recorded at its own recording.</p>
<p><strong> Shenzhen's permanent population fell for the first time </strong></p>
<p>According to the "National Economic and Social Development Statistics Announcement" announced by Shenzhen, the permanent population in 2022 was 17.6618 million, a decrease of 19,800 from 17.6816 million in 2021. This is the first time that Shenzhen has declined since its establishment in 1979. Although the population is less than 20,000, it is only one year of data, but the signal released in it is worth noting.</p>
<p>According to Chinese official data, Shenzhen GDP in 2021 increased by 6.7%over the previous year, lower than the level of 8.1%nationwide, and Guangzhou was the same as the whole country. In 2022, Guangzhou GDP increased by 1%year -on -year, far lower than the national level of 3%, while Shenzhen reached 3.3%, slightly higher than the national level. This shows that Guangzhou and Shenzhen are already in a recession.</p>
<p>In addition to the weak growth of head cities, even the most developed Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta are facing similar problems. For example, in the nine cities of the Pearl River Delta, except for Zhuhai, the remaining 8 cities have a negative growth.</p>
<p>The situation in the Yangtze River Delta is slightly better than the Pearl River Delta, but the growth rate of the overall population is also slowing. Except for Hangzhou Hefei, the population of other cities increased below 100,000. After deducting the natural growth of the local area, there were few new foreign populations.</p>
<p><strong> Provincial capital cities absorb more population </strong></p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the negative growth of first -tier cities, it is another type of city, mainly in the provincial capital, but the population has maintained a relative positive growth.</p>
<p>According to Sina.com quoted articles, in 2022, Changsha City increased by 181,300 compared with the previous year, Hangzhou increased by 172,000 compared with the previous year, and Hefei also increased by nearly 170,000. In addition, cities with a population increase of more than 100,000 are Xi'an and Nanchang, with an increase of 120,000 and 100,000 respectively.</p>
<p>The above cities have a common feature, they are all local provincial capitals. In fact, the growth of the provincial capital has lasted at least 10 years. Although it is less than first -tier cities, it is stronger. Taking Changsha as an example, at the end of 2010, the permanent population was only 7.04 million, and 10 years later surpassed the 1,000 mark.</p>
<p>Another worth mentioning is the provincial capital. At the end of 2022, Chengdu's permanent population was 2.1268 million, an increase of 76,000 year -on -year, which was not too amazing. However, Chengdu has become the fourth largest city with a permanent population of more than 20 million nationwide, second only to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing. But you know, the administrative level of these three cities is much higher than Chengdu.</p>
<p>In addition to the provincial capital, the income of China's urban population migration must be counted as a single city. These cities are provincial and cities. They are generally industrial towns. They have certain authority in the economic management and fiscal fields, but they have greater autonomy than the provincial capital.</p>
<p>At present, there are only five planned cities across China, namely Dalian, Qingdao, Ningbo, Xiamen and Shenzhen.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T16-49-36-04-00/000000.png" />The former Political Commissar of the National Liberation Army National Defense University and the rank of Liu Yaia with the rank of general air force/CCTV <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/yehuazhongnanhai/gx-05192023100640.html/@@stream"></a>Since the earlier this year, Hong Kong media revealed that Xi Jinping will "Li Xiaolin, a good friend from a young age," the husband of Li Xiaolin, who is "a good friend from a young age," and the former National Defense University Political Commissar Liu Asia shall be "executed for two years of the death penalty." Mr. Yabu Mingfu said with emotion on Facebook: "Seeing this news, I do have some emotions. Although Liu Yaia worshiped the general, he has always been a well -known Confucian general. . And it has been retired for many years, and it is not a threat to Xi Jinping's power. "</p>
<p>Mr. Yaban reviewed in his Facebook post: "One thing makes me remember. That is around 2014. A delegation in Japan visited Beijing and was seen by Li Xiaolin. Say: "I heard that you have a good personal relationship with President Xi Jinping, and have grown up since childhood. I did not expect that the young translator of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has translated this sentence into" I heard that you and President Xi Jinping have since childhood. The accompanying officials were holding back and holding up. Li Xiaolin said with a blushing face and said: 'We have been good friends since we were young, not a young bamboo horse'. "</p>
<p>Liu Asia's wife, Li Xiaolin, was shameful and blushed at the time that when he was a child, he was not a "blue horse" with today's holy Xi Jinping, which meant that they were not lovers. But the "good friends" of the innocent young age must be "young and small guess". But now ...? There are already outside reports that Li Xiaolin himself has not been "unified" by Xi Jinping, but the premise is that divorce must be divorced. Why do you do here? According to Mr. Yaban: "A few years ago, Xi Jinping did the strength of Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong in the army, which can be said to be part of your death. But this time, Liu Yaia shot completely. Grab it over and spanking ', kill chickens and monkeys, and warn those princes to respect their attitudes more. Liu Asia, one year older than Xi Jinping, is very high in the Prince Party because his father -in -law Li Xiannian has been the Standing Committee of the Politburo Committee. , President of the State ... Liu Ya is also a young man. At the age of 38, he was a political commissar of the guru and Major General of the 44 -year -old. The speed of promotion was even faster than Xi Jinping. When Xi Jinping first entered the Party Central Committee, Liu Ya and Liu Shaoqi's son Liu Yuan’s son Liu Yuan Liu Zhen's son Liu Weiping is considered Xi Jinping's relatives in the army. There is a saying that the "Three Liu" in the army ... Liu Ya is also the second generation of Red, and has the relationship between his wife and Xi Jinping. Perhaps it is because of this. He thought Xi Jinping couldn't make himself. Therefore, there were some unscrupulous speaking and writing articles. He often said: 'Chinese leaders are not as good as one generation, and it is no longer possible to have a great strategist and thinker like Mao Zedong. These words are naturally not smooth in Xi Jinping. This time, Liu Ya was taken off, maybe it was not a political problem or an economic problem.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Yaban believes that at least compared with the members of the CCP, Liu Yaia, who is very good, "speaks and write articles in some" unscrupulous ".</p>
<p>However, first of all, Liu Asia's "unscrupulous" was manifested in his early articles. Secondly, "China's leaders are not as good as one generation, and it is no longer possible to have the two sentences as great strategists and thinkers like Mao Zedong." In the early early articles of Liu Asia that the author finds as much as possible, there is no exact source.</p>
<p>The "early articles" of Liu Asia mentioned here, specifically referring to the general of Liu Asia, before the Political Commissar of the National Defense University. Of course, it was also before the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the top 18 of Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>We might as well assume that China "can no longer appear as great strategists and thinkers like Mao Zedong" once came from Liu Asia, and it can only be from his early articles. In other words, before Xi Jinping came to power, at that time, it was impossible for him to degrade or slander Xi Jinping. Because Xi Jinping himself could not think that he would become "Mao Zedong Second" in the history of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Liu Asia left the post of political commissar of the National Defense University in early 2017. At that time, overseas media had disclosed that Liu Asia was treated for corruption. Liu was exposed to paid 170 million yuan in stolen money in 2016, thinking that it was okay, but since then his corruption was reported by his former subordinates.</p>
<p>On March 5 of that year, the Hong Kong media "Sing Tao Daily" reported that on March 4, the CPC National People's Congress held a reserve meeting. Zhang Shibo, the former president of the National Defense University, appeared in an interview. In an interview, he said: "Liu Yaia is an automatic retirement."</p>
<p>The author has introduced in the past related articles. Compared with Liu Yuan, who retired one year earlier than Liu Asia, Liu Ya's retirement was silent on the Chinese media at the time, because he was not like Liu Yuan and at the same time as Liu Yuan and he retired. Like many other PLAs who retired normally, they were temporarily supplemented as a member of a special committee of the National People's Congress or a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference ------ although he was still in the 18th Central Committee of the Central Committee at the time.</p>
<p>Soon, some netizens disclosed that the key reason why Liu Ya was forced to retire was that his "The People No longer Need a Great Leader" angered Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>The main essence of this article includes: the vast majority of countries in the world do not have any "great leaders". There are only a few countries with "great leaders". Once the leader of the modern revolution has become a "great leader", it means that the revolution has failed, because a new privilege that can be arrogant can be arisen again.</p>
<p>The leader of a modern country has the same privilege of ancient emperors. The best way is to turn himself into a "great leader." Therefore, it is not a good thing to have a great leader in a country, it means that the people of this country must be moldy.</p>
<p>Once he becomes a great leader, he does not need to hand over power. His words are truth. Like the imperial decree, everyone has to be loyal to him. Essence "Great Leadership" is synonymous with modern emperors.</p>
<p>The modern revolutionary "leader" with noble sentiments can never tolerate others to hold themselves to heaven, let alone hold themselves to the sky. This is the fundamental difference between the "leader" of the modern revolution and the personal ambitionist.</p>
<p>If the political leader is respected as a great man when he is in office, then he is by no means a real great man ... So far, there are no "great leaders" in the world that have developed well. The most typical comparison is South Korea and North Korea. I have never heard of what great leaders in South Korea, and the great leaders in North Korea are so great that they are so great. The results of development are clearly seen. The same land of the same land is different. Northern Europe is the area with the smallest difference between the rich and the poor in the world. I have never heard of which great leader in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Revolutionary leaders are shameful, and the people's blind worship is ignorant. Democratic legal system, freedom and equality, restricting public rights, and protecting civil rights. This is the beautiful system that citizens of modern society should pursue. Rejecting this system will never become a respected and advanced nation. This nation will not have any light The future.However, the author of this web article is not the cloud Yiyun. He said: "I did some homework and found that this article is very interesting. Different titles spread on different websites for more than ten years. The earliest communication occurred on August 7, 2010, published on the Cultural Revolution and Contemporary History Research Network. There is no signature of the author. This article then reprinted in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2018, 2018, 20122 and 2023. There are 'people no longer need great leaders', as well as 'legendary General Liu Asia's speech', and the people where the people leaders appear will suffer!'' In addition to Liu Asia, the signature of the article is Song Shengli, Jin Tao Chen Pingfu and so on. Even the content is different. Some versions have been deleted, and some are added. "</p>
<p>After making the test above, the author concluded: "The general response of netizens is that after reading this article, I finally understood why Liu Ya was arrested. All the charges that were imposed on him were because of this ... The problem is here. I found that the finishing touch of the article 'truly noble modern revolutionary leaders can never tolerate others to hold themselves on the sky, let alone use them to hold themselves to the sky. This is the modern revolutionary leader The fundamental difference with the personal ambitionist 'has long existed in the 2010 version; at that time, Hu Jintao was in power. I inferred that the author may be generally talked at that time. Hu Jintao, because Hu has no choice but to hold himself without any means. He will not shot Xi Jinping, because Xi in 2010 is just a Chinese Communist Party Chujun. His ambitions, means, and whether they have noble sentiments, they are all in the middle of the light. No one knows that no one knows ","</p>
<p>The author continued to analyze: "Interestingly, (the people no longer need great leaders), the authors are generally talked about. Because of the precise foresight of the article, it is extremely vitality!Its essence is repeated year after year after year and year. Among them, a huge superposition effect was produced. In the spread of 2014, 2015, and 2016, this article has become the classic deep ridicule of the "great leader", and it is believed that it is President Xi of "Great Leaders". Can you not be suspicious? The text of the satirical great leaders, such as "whatever means to hold himself to the heavens', once becoming a great leader, he will not hand over power, and so on. It is certain that Xi Jinping will not know about these legendary Liu Asia views. Of course, in 2010, 'Liu Yaa' may be the speaker, but Xi Jinping in 2016 is certainly the listener's intention ... Xi Jinping cannot stand this kind of kind. The negation of his "commander ability", so he started Liu Yaia. "</p>
<p>After reading the content of the article, the author further searched, only to find that the content of this "The People No longer Need a Great Leader" was the end of the true work of Liu Asia, which was attached to Liu Asia, which made many readers difficult Debate.</p>
<p>Based on this, the author judges that the content of articles such as "the people no longer need great leaders" are "published" by Liu Asia's name "published". Sandy Liu Ya's suspicion. And Liu Asia himself must have been internally stretched out to "organize" internally.</p>
<p>At the end of April this year, a signed author published "Martyr or Funeral?" ——In the cover of Liu Asia ", one of which is: It must be acknowledged that no matter how high Liu Ya's eyes are higher than the top, unruly, not consistent with the Party Central Committee, and" discussing the great politics ". , Violence and resist "inaccurate." Except for Liu Ya in 2012, Liu Ya personally issued a statement in the Hong Kong Ming Pao, and denied that in many articles in Hong Kong Wenhui Publishing House's "Liu Asian State Thinking Records" that advocated that "China's true rise depends on the battle of political reform, and the core of political reform is democratization, especially the party, especially the party The article of Democraticization "is written by myself. At present, there are at least two articles that have been spreading overseas and highly praised," The Loss of China Reform "and" New Thinking of Chinese Political Reform -Liu Asia Internal Speech "confirmation It is a fake and counterfeit, and has been claimed by the real authors He Qingxuan and Zheng Cunzhu.</p>
<p>The author's special explanation here is that the reason why this article is specially distinguished from the "early" of Liu Asia's article and the corresponding "late stage", because if Liu Asia’s early articles, whether it is novel or military review content, it still There is also a part of "human words" (that is, the so -called "unscrupulous" content), then after he becomes an authentic, after a complete and complete PLA senior political worker cadres, all their limited "works" are all in their limited "works". Words, official words, and charm.</p>
<p>In May 2013, it was more than half a year after Xi Jinping came to power. Liu Yaia published an article "Persistence of the Sacred" Party "" in the People's Daily, loyal to Xi Jinping. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee of the General Secretary, unity and leading 100 billion people can realize the Chinese dream ... "</p>
<p>On August 19, 2013, Xi Jinping, who had just been on stage for ten months, delivered a murderous internal speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference, with a "19 -199 speech". One of the main contents is "Whether we can hold and win if the Internet battlefield is directly related to my country's ideological security and regime security ..."</p>
<p>After this speech came out, Liu Asia moved the wind, and soon published a signature article in the PLA Daily News "Western hostile forces trying to use the Internet" to knock down China. " An extreme and important work of the party is related to the future destiny of the party, the long -term security of the country, and the national cohesion and centripetal force. Our army is the people's army under the leadership of the party. We must strengthen the standard and consciousness of the forefront, and grasp the ideological work real, tight, and tight to ensure that our army has always listened to the party command, can win the battle, serve the people, and serve the people . "</p>
<p>Until the beginning of 2017 that was forced to retire, Liu Yaia touted Xi Jinping on the People's Daily and the PLA News, and there were still many of the loyal articles or interviewed by Xi Jinping's watch. This is why Mao Zuo and Pink, who had deeply hit Liu Asia's early works, described Liu Asia as a political "two -sided person" in their large criticism articles.(This episode is chaired and broadcast by high -tech)(The article only represents the personal position and point of view of the special commentator))</p>

Recently, a well -known Uighur activist calls on Malaysian Prime Minister Anwal Ibrahim to support Muslim ethnic minorities in the persecution of Xinjiang in northwestern China. Anwal Ibrahim expressed sympathy for the Uighurs in the conversation, but also called this as the "internal affairs" of China. In addition, the human rights organization claims that the Chinese authorities' telephone search plans in Xinjiang are targeted at Uighurs and other Turkic minorities. The Chinese police database also marked the queen scriptures as possible. It is understood that a research funded by the Chinese government suggested that the second capital in Xinjiang, the western part of the country, to re -balance the Chinese economy, solve racial tensions, and strengthen relations with Eurasian countries. In this episode, we will learn more about the situation together.</p>
<p>A well -known Uighur activist calls on Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to support Muslim ethnic minorities in the persecution of Xinjiang in northwestern China.</p>
<p>Abdulhakmu Idreis, director of the Uyghur Research Center of Washington, USA, met Anwar during the fasting party held in an Islamic center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Eid with a meal after the sunset during Muslims, which ended on April 20. Idris told Liberty Asia,</p>
<p>"We learned earlier that Malaysian Prime Minister Anwal Ibrahim would attend this Eid, so I prepared a letter to him, describing the current situation of the Uighurs."</p>
<p>Idreis said that in the rally, Anwar gave a speech saying that he would protect all oppressed Muslims all over the world and sympathize with the Uighurs. In 2018, Anwar asked the Chinese government to allow Uighurs to enjoy religious freedom and freedom of migration.</p>
<p>However, during the visit to China a few weeks ago, Ibrahim took a more loose attitude, saying that the Uyghur issue was "internal affairs of the Chinese government."</p>
<p>No one answered the phone call to the Malaysian Prime Minister's office afterwards.</p>
<p>Because of fear of anger China, many Muslims accounted for the majority of national governments did not publicly talk about the suppression of Uyghur people. Some countries have important trade and infrastructure projects with China under the "Belt and Road" initiative.</p>
<p>Idreis emphasized that the Uighurs were in a critical situation in Xinjiang and sought help from Premier Awars.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, Idrez gave Anwal a traditional Uyghur endless hats Doppa, as well as the letter and his book "threatened: China's colonization and Uyghur ethnic extinction to the Islamic world and the web ethnic group extinction ". Playing on both sides?</p>
<p>Erken Ekin Ekrem, deputy chairman of the World Uyghur Congress and Hacettepe, Hacettepe, said that as an experienced politician, Anwar is likely to be playing with coins - — On the one hand, deal with the Chinese government, and deal with the Uighurs on the other hand. Ik Rebu told Liberty Radio,</p>
<p>"He did not mention the Uyghur issue during his visit to China three weeks ago," Equest told Liberty Radio. "After expressing the desire to strengthen the relationship between the two countries, he returned to Malaysia."</p>
<p>"The words he conveyed to the Uyghur delegation was just a political strategy," he said. "If they do nothing, they will say,‘ we have no power. ’”</p>
<p>In addition, according to human rights observation of a report released in early May, the Xinjiang police relied on a list of multimedia documents containing 50,000 "violence and horror" to mark Uighurs and other Turkic Muslim residents for interrogation.</p>
<p>One of the results of this headquarters in New York is that the Uighurs only need to store the Gulan Scriptures on their mobile phones to cause police trial.</p>
<p>Human rights observation said in a statement that using this list is another example of China ’s“ abuse of monitoring technology in Xinjiang ”.</p>
<p>Human Rights Observation Asian Agency Director Wang Songlian(Virtual)It is said that the police use this list to compare the data of the two applications installed on mobile phones with the authorities requesting the residents of Urumqi, the authorities of Xinjiang. In an interview with Radio Free Asia, she said,</p>
<p>"In essence, these applications on people's mobile phones are checking this list -the main list -and search for other information."</p>
<p>In a statement in May, the organization stated: "Human rights observations are concerned about the way China cracks down on its so -called 'terrorism' and 'extremism' behaviors."</p>
<p>The definition of "Chinese anti -terrorism law on" terrorism "and" extremism "is too broad and blurred to sue, deprives freedom, and deprive freedom, and deprives of freedom or serious personal injury to the purpose of political, religious or ideological purposes. Other restrictions.</p>
<p>The main list of multimedia files is part of the large database of more than 1,600 data tables leaked to the online media "The Intercept" in 2019. The news agency reported that the Urumqi police monitored and arrested the police reported in the database from 2015 to 2019. Human rights observation states that the list of the organization's inspection is not reported or analyzed before the different parts of the same database.</p>
<p>Human rights observations also found that in the nine months from 2017 to 2018, Urumqi police conducted nearly 11 million search on 1.2 million mobile phones. Police searched the main list of more than 1,000 different files on the 1,000 mobile phones, and found a total of 11,000 matching.</p>
<p>The organization stated that the analysis of human rights observations found photos, audio and video files containing violent content, "there are other materials that have no obvious connection with violence", including common religious materials.</p>
<p>Human rights observation stated in its statement that the UN Human Rights Council should conduct investigations, and relevant governments should find out technology companies participating in telephone monitoring and take action to terminate their participation. Wang Songlian told Liberty Asia,</p>
<p>"I think what happened in Xinjiang is very important for the future of China, and how to use these systems for the government. What does they have to do with the general technology and human freedom in the world? This is why we have been working hard to put together these puzzles ","</p>
<p>It is understood that a research funded by the Chinese government suggested that the second capital in Xinjiang, the western part of the country, to re -balance the Chinese economy, solve racial tensions, and strengthen relations with Eurasian countries.</p>
<p>The report was published on April 21 in the Chinese journal "Xinjiang Social Sciences". It is recommended that the capital, which is specially built, is close to Kashgar in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Kashgar borders Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan.However, according to a report from the South China Morning Post, the study did not provide details of the central government's distribution functions between Beijing and the potential second capital.</p>
<p>Xinjiang has a vast desert and mountainous areas, living with more than 11 million Muslim Uighurs and other Turkic minorities. In recent years, they have been suppressed by the Chinese government, including "re -education" camp detention, torture and forced labor.</p>
<p>The study caused foreign experts and researchers in Xinjiang to question the possible motivation for the establishment of the second capital in the region and its impact on Uighurs and other ethnic minorities living there.</p>
<p>Elken Elkimu, deputy chairman of the World Uyghur Congress and associate professor of History at the University of Hastopa, Turkey, believes that the establishment of the second capital in Xinjiang will be related to China to become a world power by 2049. At that time, China will become the world's power. Essence The 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Ik Rebu told Liberty Asia,</p>
<p>"Uyghur region is important for China to dream. It is a gateway to Central Asia, West Asia, Turkey, and Europe. Therefore, the establishment of a second capital in Uighur is strategic significance to China."</p>
<p>Aike Rebu said, at the same time, the plan will create unfavorable conditions for the Uyghur people.</p>
<p>"To establish the second capital in East Turkestan, it is necessary to sinlate the region first."</p>
<p>Aike Timi uses the Uyghur's name to Xinjiang. He said that the vast territory lacks cultivated land and requires China to divert water to the area. This will need to reorganize more Han people. He said,</p>
<p>"These problems are not conducive to Uighurs, causing them to disappear due to integration."</p>
<p>Sean Roberts, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University(Sean Roberts)He wrote a large number of articles about the Chinese Uyghur and Central Asia, and he said that the move may have a dual purpose. He said,</p>
<p>"On the one hand, this may be to make the Northwest region more integrated into China. This is what China has been working hard since the 1990s. One of the motivations. "</p>
<p>On the other hand, Roberts said that the potential second capital will also be a defensive move. He pointed out,</p>
<p>"For a long time, the Chinese authorities have been worried that the Northwest region has been incorporated into the country more and placed under the jurisdiction of the country, because it is worried that it may become the root cause of unstable, and it may exacerbate due to external forces. This does not mean that the Chinese people Worried about the invasion of Central Asia or Russia, but they may worry that there are more unstable factors in Eurasia, and they hope to have a second capital nearby to ensure the security of China and make it not spread to China. "</p>
<p>Roberts also said that in the end, the plan was not a good sign for Uighurs.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-05-19T17-03-06-04-00/000000.png" />Dalai Lama Speaking at a religious summit on April 21, 2023 at the Reuters Video Screenshot at a religious summit in New Delhi, India <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/xizangzonglan/tibet-05192023095620.html/@@stream"></a>Hello everyone, my friends, I am Chen Aizheng, Tibet sends out to invite you to look at Tibet with me. Recently, the Dalai Lama emphasized the Buddhist foundation and compassion at the religious summit. This party was the first time that the Tibetan spiritual leader had a controversial video. At the same time, the Chinese government is prevented from the spread of religious content on the Internet in Tibetan monks and writers. Sources said that the move is part of the authorities that the authorities strive to destroy the influence of famous thinkers and religious figures. The Tibetan Buddhist who went to Lhasa is now facing new obstacles. They must now submit a form to local officials and a Lhasa residents provide them with guarantees. In addition, Mexican legislators waved the Chinese ambassador to the Tibetan flag, shouted "liberating Tibet" and "liberating the Uighurs", and called for ending China's "concentration camp" in Xinjiang. In this episode, we will learn more about the situation together.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama delivered a speech at the Global Buddhist Summit on April 21, talking about the importance of compassion and wisdom, and emphasizing the importance of Buddhist philosophy and values.</p>
<p>The 87 -year -old Tibetan Buddhist spirit leader said: "I can also share with you, and through this inherent development, especially focusing on wisdom and compassion, it can indeed help us increase our courage."</p>
<p>Dozens of monks in yellow, orange, and saffron monk robes appeared in New Delhi, India to participate in the two -day ritual hosted by the Indian Ministry of Culture and the International Buddhist Federation, attracting it from Tibet, Mongolia, Nepal, Vietnam, Sri Lanka , India and Myanmar, including nearly 30 countries and regions including 500 participants.</p>
<p>This is the first public appearance in the Dalai Lama who kissed a boy's mouth in a student activity in northern India on February 28 and asked him to "suck" his tongue for the first time on social media.</p>
<p>The incident caused many audiences to be disgusted. However, extending the tongue in Tibetan culture is a sign of greetings or respect or consent. The supporters of the Dalai Lama recently held a demonstration of the event against the event.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama later apologized to the boy and his family in any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the International Buddhist Federation, Jie Zun Zengpummer, said that the summit is "a good example of the world from different traditional and cultural backgrounds in harmony."</p>
<p>Although the Dalai Lama in Dalai, India did not discuss the disputes over the video recently, he did mention the topic of the struggle between Tibet and China.</p>
<p>"For example: take the current struggle and situation of Tibet as an example. If you just consider it from a narrow perspective, you will lose hope. Looking at this crisis and looking at the current situation, then your mind will be more flexible. Therefore, even in your daily life, there may be seemingly huge and unbearable problems. But if you have the courage, You will be more capable of adversity as an opportunity. "</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama has always advocated that on the basis of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with China, it is not based on the advantages and disadvantages of the nation, and solve the Tibet problem through the peaceful roads to achieve stability and coexistence.</p>
<p>Beijing will be regarded as a signs of disobedience, including peaceful protests and self -immolation.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama has no formal talks with Beijing since 2010. Chinese officials have made unreasonable demands to the Dalai Lama as a condition for further dialogue.</p>
<p>At the same time, sources told Radio Free Asia that China has been strictly banned Tibetan writers, Buddhist monks and other influential people who have spread religious content online without advance approval.</p>
<p>The suppression based on a regulations in March 2022 gives the authorities more power to limit the power of the Communist Party that the Communist Party considers to have destructive online content. one example. A Tibetan Tibetan from Tibet refused to disclose his name out of security reasons.</p>
<p>"As the Chinese government begins to implement this law, Tibetans and those who are influential have become goals and review objects. Without the Chinese government's permission, these people do not have to share or talk about Buddhism or any educational content. They are not even allowed to print any type of religious documents. "</p>
<p>This provision prohibits foreign organizations and individuals from spreading such content, except for those who have obtained the government. It requires them to not be criminally charged in the past three years. Bai Majia, a researcher -observed researcher in London, said,</p>
<p>"The Chinese government not only deprives Tibetans' basic freedom of remarks, but now Tibetans and influential people are also completely banned from sharing anything. Therefore, in recent years, we have hardly seen anything they shared on social platforms in recent years. ","</p>
<p>Tibetans from the region said that they were banned from entering the educator Yundeng Gatos and Sha Yujianzan, Tibetan historian Zi Rendunzhu, and the Chief Executive of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the capital of the regional regional capital. South.</p>
<p>According to the source of Tibetans, other Tibetans have been arrested and imprisoned for "inciting divisionism" and "harmful national security", which shows that Beijing is continuing to destroy the religion and life of Tibetan and Tibetans. The influence of people with views.</p>
<p>Another Tibetan insider from the region believes that the regulations are dual standards. He said,</p>
<p>"The Chinese government often refuses to give any licenses to Tibetans openly teaching or educated. Recently, according to regulations, this situation has become more difficult. On the contrary, social media shared too much misleading and inappropriate content. For these contents, the Chinese government has not applied any restrictions. "</p>
<p>According to Tibetans in the area, Tibetans who go to the Lhasa pilgrimage or other reasons of Tibet must now obtain permission from local officials to ensure that travelers will not incite or participate in any protests that will disturb social order.</p>
<p>Many Tibetan Buddhists went to Lhasa with a population of about 560,000 to visit major religious places such as Potala Palace, Baying Street, Jokhang Temple, and Roblin Carter Palace.</p>
<p>The journey is usually carried out by walking, and accumulating a good karma -that is, believe that the total of a person's behavior will determine the fate of their future reincarnation.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Chinese authorities tightened their restrictions on Tibetans from other parts of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan settlements of Chinese provinces to Lhasa. They asked the Tibetans to obtain a special pass to the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>But starting this year, Tibetans must fill in a separate application form by local officials and submit it to an office in Lhasa, and a resident of Lhasa must ensure that travelers will not participate in protests.</p>
<p>Beijing regards any signs of peace and self -immolation as a division of behavior, threatening China's national security.</p>
<p>A source who was unwilling to disclose for security reasons said that the authorities asked a group of Tibetans who were pilgrimage from Hongyuan County, Hongyuan County, Tibet, Sichuan Province, southwest of China to register their names in an office in the Tibetan capital."In fact, you must get a license letter from your county or village office in advance to enter Lhasa. Then, once you get it, you need a resident of Lhasa to prove that you will not participate in any form of riots."</p>
<p>Sources added that Lhasa residents guaranteed for travelers must sign a document when travelers must sign in Lhasa.</p>
<p>He said that after relaxing the restrictions on the new crown virus epidemic, the new security procedures for Tibetans began. Some Tibetans from Aba, Agan and other parts of Qinghai were forced to return because they did not know anyone in Lhasa to guarantee them.</p>
<p>Another Tibetan insider who also refused to disclose the name because of security reasons said that this change is another way for China to strengthen the suppression of Tibetans. He said,</p>
<p>"If you are a Han, you can enter Lhasa as long as you show your ID card, but for the Tibetans, the Chinese government has upgraded their restriction strategies and implemented additional procedures. Then the authorities will make it difficult for them to enter Lhasa. "</p>
<p>In addition, a group of Mexican members recently interrupted the Congress. They shouted "liberating Tibet" and "liberating Uighurs". At that time, the new Chinese ambassador to Mexico was introduced to parliamentarians.</p>
<p>On April 26, in the city of Mexico, the Speaker of the House of Representatives St. Diego Krire welcomed Ambassador Zhang Run, and then the members immediately stood up and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The representatives of the "Tibet Friends" group, Salvador Coro Kabrara and Ines Para Wallet, stood up, raised the Tibetan flag, and shouted "Free Tibet" for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The video also shouted: "Release the Uighurs!Cancel the concentration camp!" - He refers to most Muslim Uyesums being detained in the "re -education" camp, where their rights are severely violated. Legislators protested China's strict control over Tibet and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Chinese Embassy, after attending the parliamentary meeting, Zhang Run met with members of the House of Representatives in Mozhong Friendship Group, and emphasized the importance of the "one China" principle as the political foundation of bilateral relations.</p>
<p>He also welcomes Mexico to participate in the "Belt and Road" initiative and other development and security projects.</p>
<p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Mexico.</p>

<p>A British study pointed out that Russia changed the combat method after 15 months of invasion of Ukraine. This tactical transformation may pose a major threat to the Ukraine who prepares to launch a large -scale counterattack, referring to the fact that the Russian army lacks combat effectiveness or excessive.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that the Royal Institute of London (Rusi) released a 30 -page report on Friday (May 19) stating that although the outside world believes that the Russian army often has problems such as poor operation, excessive dependence of artillery, and morale, but the morale is low, but The attention of these weaknesses has caused them to ignore the progress of the Russian army on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Researchers came to an on -site interview with 10 brigades in Ukraine from April to May this year.</p>
<p>Nick Reynolds, the main author of the report, pointed out that the Russian forces are far from being exhausted by the scholars and veterans.</p>
<p>He said: "There are many things on social media, saying that Russia lacks combat effectiveness, but social media is full of publicity of both parties. At this stage, we think we need to be more sober evaluation."</p>
<p>The report emphasizes that understanding how the Russian forces change tactics are not only important to Ukraine, but also important for NATO member states.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, in order to make up for early air defense errors, Russia has rationally connected the missile system on the front line of 1200 kilometers. This tactical transformation greatly gave the Russian army to avoid and intercept weapons such as Ukraine's high -speed anti -radiation missiles (HARM), and shot down the U -Fang fighter aircraft from low -altitude from 150 kilometers.</p>
<p>Right now, Russia is still continuously improving the ability to carry out electronic warfare, causing the Ukraine to lose 10,000 drones per month. The report also stated that the Russian army seems to have a Motorola communication system that can decipher Ukraine encryption in real time.</p>
