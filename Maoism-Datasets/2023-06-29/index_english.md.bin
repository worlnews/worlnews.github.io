### China Monitoring Products: BBC Investigation Revealing the technical vulnerability of hackers to control the camera

** The monitoring cameras made in China are located in the British office, Gaojie (Shopping Street), and even government buildings. The survey of "Wide -angle Mirror" found a number of security loopholes from the two number one brand. How easy is it to invade them, what does it mean for Britain's security? **

In a BBC Broadcasting House (London), a man was sitting in front of his laptop and entering the password.

Thousands of miles away, a hacker was watching every word he hit.

Then, the BBC employee picked up his mobile phone to enter the password, and now the hacker also wrote it down.

The monitoring lens on the ceiling is made by Chinese Enterprise Hikvision, and a security loophole in it means that it now has the risk of hackers.

The hacker said, "Now this device is mine, I want to do whatever you want. I can turn it off, or use it to see what happened to BBC."

[BBC wide -angle mirror survey: new satellite image shows that Chinese spy balloons have flew over Japan and Taiwan](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-66028371)

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-28T01-45-51.000Z/_130176640_cameraview.jpg)Image adding text,

The "hacker" arranged by the BBC uses the software vulnerability of the monitoring lens to monitor the words of the BBC staff on the computer keyboard.

For this gentleman who was stared, fortunately the hacker was working on the BBC. This is one of the series of experiments conducted to test the security of the Chinese manufacturing monitoring camera.

Hikvision and Dahua are the world's leading monitoring camera manufacturers. No one knows how many of their devices in the streets and alleys in the UK.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-28T01-45-51.000Z/_130185534_camera1.jpg)Image adding text,

The results of the "Freedom of Information" show that 35 local governments in the UK are using Dahua's monitoring lens.

Last year, the privacy and vitality organization "Big Brotherwatch" attempted to find out the answer. Between August 2021 and January 2022, the organization submitted 4,510 applications to different public agencies in the UK. Among the 1289 applications that were answered, 806 items confirmed that it adopted the lens of Hikvision or Dahua -227 local parliaments and 15 police teams adopted Hikvision, and 35 local parliaments adopted Dahua.

Many government buildings also adopt the camera of Hikvision -one afternoon, "Wide -angle Mirror" in the Ministry of International Trade, Ministry of Health, Health Safety Bureau, and the Ministry of Food and Rural Affairs in the central city center of London. The service center found them.

Security experts are worried that these lenses have been used as Trojan horses to trouble the computer system, and then trigger the potential possibility of civil strife.

Professor Prof Frasersampson, a British government monitoring camera commissioner, warned that key infrastructures across the country -including power supply, transportation networks, fresh food supply and water supply -all threatened.

He said: "These are very dependent on remote monitoring, so if you have the ability to interfere with it, you can create chaos thousands of miles away without spending the power."

[British MPs have called for the disable six key points of Chinese surveillance equipment](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/uk-62036512)* [British Intelligence Chief: Chinese Science and Technology constitutes a security threat](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/uk-63225017)* [Behind the face of Chinese face recognition technology triggered the public](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-50685535)Charlesparton, a former diplomat who had worked in Beijing and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), also agreed to this: "When we were young, we watched The Italianjob; Taiwan translations "Gold Gold" and Hong Kong translation "Moisturizing and Wonderful Books"), which uses the traffic light system to paralyze the entire Turin City (Du Lin). At that time, it may be just a novel bridge. It's. "

Hikvision said to the BBC "Wide -angle Mirror" that the company is an independent company and does not pose a threat to British national security.

The company said, "Hikvision has never been engaged in any spy -related activities in the world", and said that "products are strictly required by security, which meets when operating in the UK and other countries and regions. Applicable laws and regulations. "

"Wide -angle Mirror" cooperates with the world's leading monitoring technology research institution and the "Internet Agreement Video Market" (IPVM) headquarters in the United States to test whether the camera invasion of Hikvision is feasible. IPVM provides the lens installed in the BBC studio.

Because of security reasons, "Wide -angle Mirror" cannot run the camera on the BBC network, so the lens is installed on the test network without a firewall and protecting facilities.

This camera tested by "Wide -angle Mirror" was found in the loopholes in 2017. Conor Healy, director of IPVM, described this as "Hikvision opened the back door for his own products".

Hikvision said that he did not deliberately prepare the device into the defect, and pointed out that after detecting the problem, the ligament update was almost released immediately. The company also said that the test of "Wide -angle Mirror" does not represent the current operation of the current operation, but Conner Halli said that there are still more than 100,000 vulnerabilities worldwide online.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-28T01-45-51.000Z/_130176643_ipvmexperiment.jpg)Image adding text,

The "hacker" from the IPVM institution was an experimental invasion of an experiment from a thousand miles away.

With the experiment of "Wide -angle Mirror", John Scanlan, an IPVM research engineer, was sitting in front of the laptop computer in its US Pennsylvania headquarters.Hili and Sanlan first located the lens installed in the BBC Broadcasting Building, and then began to attack its security system.

Higher followed the timing and see how much time it takes to obtain the control of the lens. After 11 seconds, Schalan announced: "We have entered the camera."

They can now see the interior appearance of the studio, including the employees of "Wide -angle Mirror" sitting in front of laptops.

"If we pull the camera closer to the keyboard, we can clearly see every button that he knocked when he enters the password."

"This is like the key to your house, and at the same time, it secretly equipped with a lily of all the door locks in the entire community. The engineer of Hikvision is basically doing this."

###  Is the Chinese government monitoring you?

From a spy balloon to the secret police to the escape from the disgraceful, [Panorama (Panorama) survey and report China ’s global monitoring operation](https://www.bbc.com/programmes/m001n9sh)Essence We revealed new details about the Beijing Spy Balloon Fleet, and also black into a Chinese -made monitoring camera, showing how similar devices on the streets can be used.

BBC Chinese will publish a complete video version of the report later, so stay tuned.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-28T01-45-51.000Z/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png)Hainan Wei said that its product was "no 'back door'", nor did they leave loopholes without deliberate programming, and said that they believed that all the British local government departments that used their device had already installed and updated their cameras.

The hackers followed the second experiment -to control Dahua's camera through the infiltration control software.

IPVM sets two test cameras in its headquarters. If they succeed, they may control the camera of a entire network.

They found the weaknesses of the software for a long time. Higher said, "That's it, we go in."

Now they enter the system and can use the camera to eavesdrop.

Higher explained: "Many people have not noticed that many of these shots are equipped with microphones." Although users sometimes shut down, hackers have to restart the camera, which is easy to redeem, that is, they can actually eavesdo this room.

Dahua said that after the company learned the loopholes last year, it "conducted a comprehensive investigation immediately" and quickly corrected it through "renewal of the ligaments".

The company also claims that it has no national support, and its equipment will not interfere with key British infrastructure. The company said: "These allegations are not true, and it is misleading to the image of Dahua technology and its products."

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-28T01-45-51.000Z/_130176641_profsampson.jpg)Image adding text,

Professor Sampson, a British government monitoring camera commissioner, described that the British monitoring video network has "serious inherent risks".

However, experts believe that Britain must double hard to protect himself from Professor Sampson's "Digital Asbestos" by Professor Professor Sampson in the UK.

He said: "We have installed these devices in the previous generation, and most of them are based on them. Now we are aware that they have some serious inherent risks, so what should we do?"

When asked if he trusted Hikvision and Dahua, he replied, "Never."

### China LGBT: Under the "force majeure", the dilemma faced by the sex minority groups

* ANNABELLE LIANG * BBC reporter

2017 Shanghai Proud Festival.

** On the occasion of the "Pride Month" celebrations around the world, China does not have any major LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activities. **

The country's largest "pride" event has been suspended since 2021.

The organizer of the event, a organization called "Shanghai Proud Festival", did not disclose the reason for it, [at the time just indicated](https://shpride.com/2020/08/13/ending/?lang=en)"It will cancel all the upcoming activities and terminate the future activity plan."

In China, people who participate in political protests often face punishment, so the Shanghai Pride will not hold a parade, but organizes dances, community long -distance running and movie screening in the city.

Now, for the sexy groups, there are only a few low -key activities to choose from. For example, the so -called "Voguing Ball (Fashion Dance Style Dance)", the dancers in the party will dance some dance steps inspired by the model.

The Shanghai Pride Festival is not the only LGBT organization to stop operation.

In recent years, several other organizations have to close, which has aroused concerns about the world's second largest economy to crack down on social activities.

According to reports, dozens of accounts focusing on LGBT topics have been deleted on the popular social application WeChat.

In the same year, an organization representing LGBT group members filed a legal lawsuit. It is reported that the founder was detained by the authorities and the release of his conditions was to close the group.

Last month, the Beijing Comrade Center (Beijing LGBT Center) became the latest organization that was suspended from the latest "resistance to force majeure".

[China's iconic gay institution "is closed due to force majeure", and a minority group feels "lips and teeth cold"](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-65656315)"The Comrade Center of Beijing was closed, and China's last large LGBT organization also decided to stop," Raymond Phan, the founder of Shanghai's Pride Festival, said to BBC.

After his group canceled Shanghai's annual celebration, Peng Lei left China.

"The leaders and initiatives of the Shanghai Proud Festival are under tremendous pressure, and organizational activities become more and more difficult," he said.

"After 12 years of operation, the organizers have agreed that we can rest, charge charge, and wait for the situation."

Another leader of LGBT groups who also left China told the BBC that the pressure from the authorities could not bear the people who promoted social reforms.

"The organizers were detained, and their family and friends were questioned by the police. This caused a lot of mental health pressure," said the activist who requested anonymous anonymous.

"Before the epidemic, the environment of the LGBT group is very good. We can express loudly and win some lawsuits," said the activist.

"I think we are too loud."

### trend is changing

A centralized research agency Daxue Consulting estimated that in 2019, 75 million people in China considers themselves to be the LGBT population -about 5%of the total population.

The LGBT group has always been committed to initiating a series of issues, including same -sex marriage, which has not been recognized in China.

In 1997, China implemented the implementation of homosexuality, and the Chinese Medical Association Psychiatric Branch stopped listed it as a mental disorder in 2001.

In 2019, the National People's Congress of the highest legislature in China acknowledged that legalization of same -sex marriage was one of the primary demands of citizens.

However, in recent years, with the citizen's rights movement and network abnormalities, the space of LGBT initiative has shrunk.

In 2021, a notice from the Ministry of Education of China pointed out that Chinese young men became too "feminine", which caused response.

The Ministry of Education called on schools to comprehensively reform physical education teaching and strengthen recruitment of teachers.

It recommends recruiting retired athletes and people with sports background -and "vigorously develop" sports like football in order to "cultivate students' masculinity."

Later that year, China ’s radio and television regulatory agency said that“ feminine aesthetics ”would be prohibited from entertainment programs and pointed out to avoid“ vulgar Internet celebrities ”.

The State Administration of Radio and Television also claims to promote the more masculine man's image defined, and criticize the male celebrities with too many makeup.

Nevertheless, some LGBT's personal popularity has increased.

Former police Ma Paoli was one of them. He became a headline news when he gave up his law enforcement career for nearly 20 years of law enforcement career.

Ma Baoli founded a comrade appointment application

The BlueCity of Ma Baoli Technology Company was listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in the United States in 2020, becoming the world's first LGBT social networking site company.

However, the Blue City brothers were removed and converted into private in August last year.

Ma Baoli resigned from the position of chairman and chief executive officer, and did not have the appointed successor.

In the popular WeChat communication program, one of his posts implied how difficult it is to operate the LGBT business in China.

"We turn ideals into reality, and it is possible to become possible," he wrote. "I feel satisfied and regretful because I complete my mission."

According to its website [Introduction](https://www.blued.com/en)The app has more than 40 million users worldwide. The Blue City Brothers and Ma Baoli did not immediately respond to the BBC's comment request.

"These issues are more serious among countries with more society and family discrimination," said Timothy Hildebrandt, associate professor of the London School of Political Science.

Peng Lei, who lives outside China, continues to support China's LGBT group overseas."Grassroots, individuals and enterprises can still be advocated in their own fields, and they can play their creativity in contact with the community and allies," Peng Lei said.

"The current space for initiative is very limited, but we should not stop trying."

(Voice of Germany Chinese) [Heili], who participated in the Republican presidential campaign(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美前驻联合国大使黑利与特朗普割席/a-56557816)(Nikkihaley) said in a speech at the US Enterprise Institute that almost all of Trump's focus was on the US -China trade relations, but it was too little to the rest of the threats brought by China.

She specifically pointed out that Trump failed to gather allies in response to China's threats, and also gave congratulations to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. Hei Li said: "This issue a wrong signal to the world. Chinese communism should be condemned, not congratulations."

[Heili](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美驻联合国大使辞职-特朗普又失一员将/a-45822613)The campaign team claimed that this was a keynote speech of foreign policy. Just a week and a half ago, US Secretary of State Brosky met with Xi Jinping in Beijing. Brinken said that the two sides agreed to stabilize US -China relations. However, there are almost no signs that any party is willing to concessions on the issues of trade, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong human rights, and the Chinese army on the South China Sea event and Russia's war on Ukraine.

Heili does mention Trump's trade restrictions on tariffs on China, but adding, "It's not enough to see it clearly."

### Trump's election campaign said that the communist will be prohibited from entering the country

At the same time, [Trump](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/被控34項罪名-特朗普拒認罪/a-65231252)In the election campaign, it will use the "Immigration and National Act 212 (F) clause" to order my government to prevent all communists and Marxists from entering the country. " Trump spoke at the Washington Freedom Alliance meeting: "Those people who come to enjoy our country must love us. We must block foreign communists, Marxists, and socialists who hate foreign hate Christians in the United States. In addition. "

He Li, who had served as the Ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, said that [Biden](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/80歲拚連任-拜登我將投入2024大選/a-65274912)It is "worse" in responding to China's threat of the US economy, internal affairs and military security. She said that China ’s military preparation and threat to Taiwan showed that the country is“ making people prepare for war ”. She said that if it is not stopped, the United States and other global partners will be involved in the conflict.

Heili said: "We must maintain peace and avoid war now. We need a leader to face this threat in each showing unity." She said, "Communist China is an enemy and the most faced by us since World War II. Dangerous foreign threats. "

In the Q & A session of the speech, Heili said in the Uyghur situation that this was a potential racial extinction. She said that the world was ignoring this matter, which was shameful.

### to assist Ukraine "too slow, too weak"

In his speech, Heili also said that Biden was "too slow and weak" in assisting Ukraine. She warned that if she failed to provide sufficient military equipment to help against Russia's invasion, it would only encourage China to invade Taiwan as soon as possible, which would cause international conflicts.

She said: "The incident that happened last weekend showed how weak and crumbling the Russian leadership was." She referred to the event that the mercenaries briefed to Moscow. "Don't make mistakes: China is paying attention to this war in Ukraine with great interest."

Both Trump and Santis have stated that defending Ukraine is not a national security priority in the United States. De Santis also had to take back his statement that he called Russia's "territorial dispute" in the Ukrainian war.

Last month, Biden approved a new military aid plan to Ukraine, with a total value of 300 million US dollars, including a series of other weapons such as the new ammunition of drones. Since Russia launched offensive dependence on February 24, 2022, the United States has provided more than $ 37.6 billion weapons and other equipment to Ukraine.

The mutiny that happened in Russia last weekend shocked the world.

Although the incident calmed down for a day, the incident was obviously not over: the strong combat force was not punished, and the armed force was not dissolved, but it was preserved. The biggest far -reaching impact is that Putin is losing the orthodox nature of long -term rule, that is, the image of the stable and security guarantor and guardian of the Russian country that Putin has shaped for many years has begun to collapse, especially in the background where the Ukrainian war continues Down. At the same time, Putin's influence in the international community is also rapidly declining, and this impact on China is particularly not to be underestimated.

It is the risk of possible changes in the EU’ s political climate and trade policy. It also mentioned the possibility of trade restrictions on imports of Chinese cars. There is a tendency to increase. According to Politico, the European Commission is discussing whether to launch an anti -dumping survey and anti -subsidy investigation of China's electric vehicles. The EU's internal market commissioner and Frenchman Bretton also stated that "it is very supportive to launch an anti -dumping survey of electric vehicles, the faster the better."

One of the biggest promotions behind this possible trend comes from France. Last year, before the Paris Motor Show, French President Macron told French media that Europe needs a strong policy to promote European reinstation. He said, "Our strategy is that more and more people buy France, but the current data is cruel: more than 80%of electric cars are imported." Macron mentioned that he set his goal to French electric electricity. The automotive industry has achieved 100%French manufacturing. According to Politico, in a May speech, Macron said that the EU cannot repeat the mistakes on the electric car market on the electric car market. The EU has fallen into a dependence on China on the photovoltaic board. According to French Ministry of Economic Affairs officials, the idea of taxation of imported cars in China "is in line with the EU's unbelievable and fair competition."

For the modern economy, the risk is impossible, which can only lead to the economic state of the economy, degenerate to a simple linear worker and peasant economy. In the process of modern economic governance, it can only coexist with risks for a long time. Through decentralized modern market economy and diversified social organizations, uncertainty should be cope with uncertainty, forming an anti -fragile tough circulation structure.

The endogenous nature of risks is coexisting through the small domestic fluctuations and risks to avoid large collapse risks and crises. This is a modern risk governance concept and a dynamic thinking. On the contrary, a knife -cut approach that attempts to clear the risk seems to temporarily clear the risks, and in fact accumulation and hiding greater risks. For example, the problem of real estate, in order to clear the real estate bubble and debt, the entire industry has adjusted huge adjustments. It seems that the housing price bubble and the debt of real estate companies have been suppressed. However, local finances have undergone great pressure. The rotten tail actually created greater economic and social risks. Data show that since the release of the "three red lines" of real estate for more than two years, real estate investment has fallen by about 20%, and the land transfer fund of local governments has decreased by about 70%. By July 2022, the nation's rotten tailou accounted for nearly 4%, and I am afraid that in the past year.

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-29T-11-02-07-00-00/000000.png)The tensions between the United States and China have been heating up in recent years. US president Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump said Beijing is the most serious threat to the United States' long -term dominant position in the United States.

However, the Biden government recently tried to cool down the tension. Ye Lun told Microsoft National Broadcasting Corporation (MSNBC) that she hoped to "go to China to rebuild the contact."

Ye Lun said: "There is a group of new leaders who need to understand each other." But she refused to disclose the exact date of expected visiting Beijing. Bloomberg News reported that it would be visited in early July.

Washington's export ban on high -end semiconductors and other trade restrictions on China deepen the suspicion of US -China relations.

In the interview, Ye Lun acknowledged that there were differences between the two countries and emphasized that the United States would continue to defend its national security interests.

Ye Lun said: "The United States is taking action and will continue to take action in order to protect our national security interests. Even if this will bring us some economic costs, we will still do this."

But Ye Lun pointed out that economic competition will benefit the two countries.

She said: "Better competition is good for companies and workers in the United States and China. This is both possible and desirable."

![](Images/rficn/2023-06-29T-18-02-08-00-00/000000.png)According to the new research published by ScienceAdvances today, Greenland not only has the above benefits, but also helps people to slow down their body aging. Those who can contact green spaces are 2.5 years younger than those who cannot contact.

Research Reporter, Northwestern University (Kyeezu Kim), Ph.D. Kim, told AFP: "Living in more greenery can make you younger than the actual age. "

I found that contacting green space was related to the healthy cardiovascular and reduced mortality rates. It is generally believed that this is because the body has more activities and social interaction, but it is not clear whether the park can really slow down cell aging.

To clarify this, the research team reviews the so -called DNA methylation.

In the past research, the so -called "Epigenetic Clock (also known as the aging clock") of the so -called "Epigenetic CLOCK" of DNA methylation data) is a good indicator for predicting health status such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive functions. , Can measure age more accurately than the calendar year.

Golden colleagues tracked more than 900 white people in Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland in the 20 years from 1986 to 2006.

The research team uses satellite imaging to evaluate the residence of the subject and the distance from the surrounding vegetation, as well as the park, and match these data with the blood samples collected for 15 and 20 years to determine their physiological age.

The research team establishes a statistical model to evaluate the results, and controls the variables that may affect the results, such as education, income, and smoking. As a result, it is found that compared with the 20%greening rate around the house, the 5 -kilometer radius greening rate of 5 kilometers is 30 30%. For %, average physiological age is 2.5 years younger.

But this benefit is not equal. African -American physiological age with more green space is only 1 year young, and white is 3 years younger.

Kim said: "Other factors, such as stress, quality of green space around, and other social support, can affect the benefits of green space in physiological aging."

"He is not just to prevent Pu Ting's face lost, or to rescue Porigin, or avoid letting the Russian outbreak of civil war. He only cares about his personal survival, because Luca Shenke knows that once the Russian regime is crumbling, Luka Shen Ke will be the next. "

Da Da added, "What is the actual purpose of the Wagner Group (actually the Russian army) in Belarus? The purpose is to occupy Belarus or threatened to attack Ukraine from Belarus. It aims to have an additional threat to Ukraine from the north? Causes a potential threat to our Poland as a member of NATO?

Zeleiski believes that "NATO must unanimously say to the Polish and Lithuanian community that if Wagner elements embarked on Lithuania or Poland's land, then no matter where they are, all Wagner elements will be eliminated."

President Ukraine believes that the next league summit hosted in Lithuania on July 11 is "an excellent platform for conveying this information."

#### 存

On the other hand, a military leader of a Wagner Group nicknamed "Brester" called for not to rush to describe the Wagner soldiers as traitors. Brester said that Wagner Group will transfer it to the Russian Ministry of Defense, and some of the battle will fight. Personnel will serve in Belarus.

He continued, "I am very interested in working in Belarus. I want to improve the level of combat reserve there and teach Wagner's experience to the soldiers," then added, "We must give up fantasies, because Belarus may have to face it to face The serious development of the situation, we must prepare for this. "

Belarus announced on Tuesday that Church of Wagner arrived in the capital Minsk by aircraft take off from Russia.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ended the agreement reached on Saturday to end the Wagner rebellion in Russia. The agreement includes Porigen to Minsk, and his subordinates can choose to join the Wagner Group or integrate into the Russian regular armed forces.

#### Don't assassinate him

Before Porigon arrived, President Belarus confirmed that he had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin not to assassinate commanders of Wagner during the Wagner rebellion.

According to a video posted on the Telegram application on the President Semi -official channel, Lukashenko said in front of Belarusian officials: "I tell Putin . But I said, 'Don't do this.' "

At the same time, Ukraine President Zelei Sky said on Wednesday that some members of the Wagner Group are still in Ukraine, but the security situation in the northern part of the country is still under control and no change has occurred.

The day before Zelezzki made the above remarks, the head of the Wagner Group Purig was appointed from Russia to Belarus, a neighbor of northern Ukraine after an attempted rebellion against Moscow.

When asking Wagner Group exist in Belarus, Zerrenzki said, "I think this power will not be strong."

Zeleizki added: "Our army believes that the situation in northern my country has not changed, in our control."

#### New details about the rebellion

On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal reported that after the internal intelligence discovered this conspiracy, the Russian Wagner Special Forces Commander's attempted soldiers launched by the Russian military leadership were advanced.

The Wall Street Journal quoted Western officials who did not disclose their names and reported that the goal of Porigon's planning conspiracy was to arrest the Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Hazaru and the Armed Force Chief of Staff Waleri Glacimov.

Bloomberg quoted the newspaper that the Russian Federal Intelligence Agency learned the conspiracy two days in advance, which may explain the reason why Perigon decided to advance to Moscow.

The newspaper stated that the plan to join the assumptions of the rebellion based on certain factions of the Russian army.

Ke Wenzhe (left)

** More than half a year before the Taiwan 2024 presidential election, a poll released by Taiwan TV TVBS last week showed that it had represented the presidential candidate of Taiwan's third largest party and former Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe's support accident. Leading, and on behalf of the Kuomintang, the mayor of New Taipei, Hou Youyi, fell third, causing heated discussions in Taiwan. **

Although the polls of other institutions later said that Lai Qingde, who represented the DPP, returned to the first place, Ke Wenzhe's rising momentum has triggered the anxiety of the Kuomintang supporters and the DPP's tension.

In addition, Ke Wenzhe recently threw the issue of the service trade agreement that caused Taiwan's "Sunflower Movement" nine years ago, and once again caused a debate. When Ke Wenzhe was in the political circle of the political circle, he was surrounded by the generation of outsiders in the political circle. Now he said that if he was elected president, he would negotiate a trade agreement with Beijing.

The "Sun Flower Study Games" broke out in Taiwan in 2014. At that time, Ke Wenzhe was surrounded by the rise of the political circle of outsiders and was surrounded by the Sunflower Movement for generations.

LEVNACHMAN, assistant professor of the Asia -Pacific Research University of Taiwan Politburo, analyzed the BBC Chinese analysis. Although the outside world believes that most of the supporters of Ke Wenzhe are young people, Ke Wenzhe is also eating the Kuomintang ticket, and the latter supporters are mainly middle -aged and older. How many Kuomintang votes can be taken away by Ke Wenzhe are the focus of observation now.

Zhang Junhao, a professor at the Department of Political Department of Donghai University, analyzed that the support of each candidate at this stage is mainly "negative voting". With less support, the popularity is rising. However, he emphasized to the BBC in Chinese that Ke Wenzhe's amazing political style may lead to the anti -spokes of his speech during the election, that is, Taiwan, commonly known as "back darts". He said that, for example, Ke Wenzhe's position on the service trade agreement has changed, as well as previous speeches and criticizing "there are too many (some schools) sciences and some students taught without that value", they may create a political crisis for themselves.

###

According to the highlight of the TVBS poll center on June 16, Ke Wenzhe's support was 33%, from the original third place to the leader. After Lai Qingde settled at 30%support, Hou Youyi's support was only 23%. On June 20, the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation announced the June poll in June. Lai Qingde's support was 36.5%, followed by Ke Wenzhe 29.1%, Hou Youyi ranked 3rd in 20.4%. Compared with the polls published in May, Ke Wenzhe rose 4%overtaking Hou Youyi The latter fell 7.2%.

Ke Wenzhe's young people in the current polls are the leading support.

It is worth noting that at present, it seems that Ke Wenzhe's support in the young ethnic group has won Lai Qingde and Hou Youyi. The above-mentioned polls of TVBS show that Ke Wenzhe's support at the age of 20-29, 30-39 has 58%and 55%, while Lai Qingde is 17%and 18%, and Hou Youyi is 12%. At the end of June, the polls of the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that Ke Wenzhe's support at the age of 20-24 was as high as 67%, and 40%of the ages of 25-34 were supported.

The latest polls of another public opinion agency "Beautiful Island Electronics News" also supported 40 % of the support in 20-29 and 30-39 years old. This shows the absolute advantage of Ke Wenzhe on young people's votes.

Nine years later, he seemed to be supported by the young Taiwanese voters in the next generation.

For example, after the well -known player in Taiwan's e -sports, "Asian Tongshen" stated that he wanted to support Ke Wenzhe, the local well -known game active game "Dingte" also broadcast publicly to support Ke Wenzhe a few days ago. He criticized, "How many times the blue and green have been changed, which time is not a political party tied the consortium?" He also said that "let the people who really have the ideal ideal, do not have to be limited by the consortium, dirty things."

The publication of Shan Houzhi, a senior political commentator in Taiwan, believes that in the era of fragmented social media, Ke Wenzhe's style is particularly easy to please middle voters and young ethnic groups. He said that Ke Wenzhe had long understood that young voters were his main support group. In just eight years in politics, Ke Wenzhe not only actively participated in lectures on colleges and universities, but also often had dialogue with high school students. During this time, he trained good skills to talk to young people.

For example, Ke Wenzhe served as the mayor of Taipei. In order to launch a new machine to test a body temperature in order to implement the epidemic prevention, it spent more than 10 million yuan for NT $. Shan Houzhi said, "He not only does not want to admit that there is a lack of governance, but also tries to provoke the opposition between generations and highlight that he will offend the elderly at the expense to maintain fairness."

Ye Yaoyuan, a professor at the International Research Lecture of St. Tatk University in the United States, analyzed that the young people's understanding or interest in politics was basically weak. However, he said that this is not only in Taiwan, but also a common phenomenon around the world. Therefore, the evaluation method of politicians is often based on "feeling". This is why Ke Wenzhe attracts Taiwanese young people and scientific and technological talents.Ye Yaoyuan [Represents](https://www.facebook.com/profyehinternationalaffairs/posts/pfbid02tgfWKLSoxhaBZ35vDXWu7ndtYynZk6k2t9JvfYA7uC3GFQJCX9UKzWhZN47xbCpUl)Young people believe that Ke Wenzhe broke the traditional political framework, but the essence of politics is "compromise and distribution."

In addition, Brianhiou, a guest researcher at the Taiwan University of Nottingham, explained to BBC that populism is Ke Wenzhe's political style. Police polical satisfaction is at the bottom of the year, but it still enjoys high popularity.

Image adding text,

The third forces led by Ke Wenzhe, the People's Party, uses the slogan "Breaking the Blue and Green Monopoly" and "Breaking the ideology" as the slogan, hoping to attract the support of middle voters and young voters (the picture shows Ke Wenzhe's information).

For example, in the past few days, Ke Wenzhe criticized the Democratic Progressive Party with "letting a dog bite". He also used "dogs" to blame the party workers. When he visited Japan in May this year, he responded to the critical criticism of Bonnieglasser, a key think tank scholar across the United States across the sea across the sea. ? "

After returning to Taipei from Tokyo, he shouted to the US -Taiwan Association (AIT) chairman Laurarosenberger, "She wants to see me, ask her to move to Kaohsiung." "It states," Emphasis of male and young women is the instinct of creature. When a profession is rising, it means that the industry is not falling. "

Analysis of Ke Wenzhe's phenomenon, Nanle told BBC that in addition to young ethnic groups as the main supporters of Ke Wenzhe, there is actually a "anti -anti -voting" that is dissatisfied with the Blue and Green Party (which means voting that is unhappy or hateful). But Nanle believes, "But the variables of the election are still very large now. Each candidate began to fall down or climb up. It depends on how the election strategy is wrong." Love brings challenges.

### Return to the service trade agreement to recruit the "Sun Flower Generation" rebound

Ke Wenzhe said last week that if he was elected, he would consider restarting the service trade agreement that caused a political storm in Taiwan's society nine years ago, and his move accidentally encountered a political crisis. Some comments believe that young people in Taiwan in their 30s, that is, the young generation of the Sun Flower Movement, began to rebound on Ke Wenzhe's re -service trade proposition.

The so -called "service trade agreement" refers to the follow -up agreement of the "Cross -Strait Economic Cooperation Architecture Agreement" signed by Taipei and Beijing in June 2010 (ECFA). At that time, many young people in Taiwan protested that the Kuomintang tried to forcibly pass the service trade agreement and believed that the service trade would bring a major negative impact on Taiwan society. Therefore, the Taiwan Legislative Yuan was occupied and shocked Taiwan society. "Huang Guochang and other emerging politicians entered politics.

The rise of the Sunflower Movement also promoted Ke Wenzhe. Emerging politicians such as "Sun Flower War" and Huang Guochang entered politics.

Ke Wenzhe, who is now rushing to the presidential position, acknowledged in an interview with the Taiwan media on June 26 that if he was elected, he would first launch the "Regulations on the Supervision of the Cross -Strait Agreement", then conduct a "trade negotiation", and then handle the "service trade negotiation". Essence He said that if he was elected, he would definitely move in this direction. Huang Guochang, a former legislator of the Taiwan "Time Power" party, which interacts frequently with Ke Wenzhe, did not refute the "anti -black box, not anti -trade" for Ke Wenzhe. clear."

Ke Wenzhe pointed out that if mainland China is an important economic object to Taiwan, it is necessary to deal with this issue with a pragmatic attitude. He also said that the Blue and Green camps criticized him, which showed that he did something right in some aspects.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-29T01-40-58.000Z/_130226877_gettyimages-459627130.jpg)Image source, getty images

Image adding text,

When he was elected Mayor of Taipei in 2014, Ke Wenzhe was supported by the young ethnic group of the Sun Flower Movement. His recent remarks on restarting service trade negotiations may affect his support in this group.

Du Zhenhua, a retired professor at the National Fa Institute of Taiwan University, told the media that if the signing trade between the two sides of the strait is much better for Taiwan. Many controlling service industries can open each other, "you can earn high salary and high profit." He believes that the level of service industry in Taiwan is higher than the mainland, and there is no need to be afraid of opening up.

However, critics believe that in the moment when the US -China trade war has begun, Taiwan semiconductor industry is rising, Taiwanese businessmen return, and the disagreement between cross -strait relations, whether Taiwan society is preparing to accept the mainland service industry and telecommunications industry and publishing industry, including talents to enter Taiwan. Still a question mark.

There are also critics' commitments to "goods out, people coming in, and Taiwan's big fortune" proposed by service trade supporters. They have no confidence. Instead, "if the monthly salary of 9,000 (Taiwan dollars) comes to Taiwan, you really think you can be able to be you. Do you do a high salary? "

### Kuomintang's blood loss

Regardless of the position, many data show that Ke Wenzhe's polls overtaking Hou Youyi are a trend. But for half a year before the election vote, various issues will affect the support rate of candidates.

![](Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-29T01-40-58.000Z/_129751864_taipei.jpg)Image source, EPA

Image adding text,

Ke Wenzhe's people's party is considered a "light blue" party, but he also seems to have attracted the traditionally not the Kuomintang's voters.

Analyzing the latest two -month polls of major institutions and media in Taiwan, and a scholar Kagawa Hoshi, a scholar of the Japanese University of Foreign Languages, who had accurately predicted the results of the chief elections last year, pointed out that Taiwan's politics and media will be affected by the polls. It is inevitable, but the support intention of voters has not really stabilized, and it is normal for poll data to fluctuate.

Professor Ogasawara, who studied Taiwan for decades, said that the current characteristics of three parties candidates are: Lai Qingde is stable, Ke Wenzhe rises, and Hou Youyi fights hard. However, he analyzed that in the early June polls, the interviewees targeting who selected, and the proportion of "no opinion / decision" began to decrease, that is, the climbing of voters' "expressive rates" is particularly worthy of attention.Qiu Qixin told the BBC Chinese that the Taiwan presidential election shows a pattern of different local elections. For example, Hou Youyi has performed well in local politics and is very popular, but his performance on the stage of the presidential election is not good. In contrast, although Ke Wenzhe may be regarded as a poor grade to govern Taipei, "but Ke's political image may attract voters in the presidential election, because they want to choose a candidate with a strong and distinctive personality- Hou has no such personality, but Ke has it. "

Qiu Qixin explained that Hou Youyi did not have a strong political style as Ke Wenzhe's civilian style, so it was more difficult to attract hesitant middle voters. In addition, even if Ke Wenzhe's people's party is considered a "light blue" party, he seems to have attracted not traditionally a voter who is not a Kuomintang supporter. This also explains why Hou Youyi lost blood from the other side.

In the past, everyone said "to change his destiny in college", and now I think so much. Chinese rich people have fewer graduates from key universities. There are many ordinary universities, and many people have not even went to college. From the perspective of ordinary people, the income and achievements of most people have little relationship with the university ranking. Of course, everyone generally feels that a good dad is more helpful than going to the university to employment and development. Does these cognition make sense?

Description: People familiar with the matter said that the Biden government is considering further restricting China to obtain high -end chips that drive artificial intelligence to reduce national security risks. Potential policies may have a blow to Nvidia and other American semiconductor manufacturers. Huang Renxun, the CEO of Ritchie B Tongo/EPA, Via Shutterstock, warned that if the trade between China is cut off, the American technology industry will face risks.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-29T02-10-45-08-00/28dc-chinachips-chjz-master1050.jpg)According to five familiar situations, the Biden government is considering additional restrictions on the ability to obtain key technologies in China, including restrictions on the sales of high -end chips used to drive artificial intelligence.

These restrictions will restrict the sales of Nvidia and Chaowei Semiconductor Company to China(AMD)Advanced chips produced by companies such as Intel, these chips are needed for data centers that provide kinetic energy for artificial intelligence.

Government officials said that China's artificial intelligence capabilities may strengthen Beijing's military and security agencies, thereby pose a national security threat to the United States. The worrying aspects include artificial intelligence being used to manipulate weapons, conduct cyber warfare, and to track the facial recognition system of disgraceful people and ethnic minorities.

However, this restriction will cause a blow to semiconductor manufacturers, including manufacturers in the United States, and most of their income is still from China.

The Wall Street Journal reported this consideration earlier. After reports that might have a blow to export, Nvidia's stock price closed 1.8%on Wednesday. The company has always been one of the main beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, and the stock price has soared about 180%this year.

Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Corolt Cresan said at an event hosted by an investment company on Wednesday that if such restrictions are adopted, it will not immediately affect Nvidia's financial performance. But in the long run, they "will cause the American industry to permanently lose the opportunity to compete and lead one of the world's largest markets," she said. She also added that China usually accounts for 20%to 25%of the company's data center revenue, in addition to the chip used for artificial intelligence, it also includes other products.

The stock price of chip companies, Qualcomm and Intel, fell less than 2%on Wednesday, and AMD fell slightly by 0.2%.

The US Department of Commerce, responsible for supervision of export control, refused to comment on this, and Intel also refused to comment. AMD did not respond to the comment request.

The Biden government strives to prevent China from getting advanced technologies required from autonomous vehicles to robots. Restricting sales of high -end chips will be the latest measures.

In October last year, the government has a type of advanced semiconductor and chip manufacturing machinery that may be exported to China [released comprehensive restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/business/the-biden-administration-is-weighing-further-controls-on-chinese-technology.html)Essence These regulations are applicable to the entire industry, but the impact on Nivine Dada is particularly serious. As an industry leader, the company is banned from selling its top A100 and H100 chips to China, unless a special permission is obtained. These two chips are used to run many process processes required to build artificial intelligence.

In order to cope with these restrictions, Nvidia last year [The A800 and H800 chips began to provide relegated A800 and H800 chips in China](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-nvidia-offers-new-advanced-chip-china-that-meets-us-export-controls-2022-11-08/)Essence

The additional restrictions are considering a part of the final confirmation process of previous regulations. It will also ban the sales of A800 and H800 chips of Nvidia, as well as the sales of high -end chips produced by competitors such as AMD and Intel, unless these companies will continue the Ministry of Commerce to continue Licensing to China.

Relevant review triggered a fierce lobbying battle, and Intel and Nvidia are trying to prevent their business from further restrictions.

Chip companies said that cutting off their connections with major markets like China will greatly reduce their income and reduce their ability to spend in the research and innovation of new chips. In an interview with the Financial Times last month, Nvidia CEO [Huang Renxun warned](https://www.ft.com/content/ffbb39a8-2eb5-4239-a70e-2e73b9d15f3e)If you cut off the trade between the US technology industry and China, you may face "huge losses".

The Biden government also discussed the scope of the sale of chips in China. Their goal is to limit the technical capabilities that can help Chinese military guide weapons, develop autonomous drones, carry out cyber warfare, and provide power to monitor systems, while minimizing the impact of these rules on private enterprises.

At the time of the introduction of this measure, the United States is also considering [Expanding restrictions on investment in the US investment in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html)This may also irritate the Chinese government. After the Chinese reconnaissance balloon flying over the United States over the United States this year, the Sino -US relations declined, and the Bayeng government has been committed to improving bilateral relations in recent weeks.

Experts have different interpretations of Lieutenant General Abdul Fathah Burgal of Sudan Sovereign Commission, and the latter warns in the statement that there is a conspiracy that threatens Sudan Man fights with his so -called rebels.

Surprisingly, the Boolean seeks the help of compatriots, and the rapid support forces seek the help of mercenaries from neighboring countries.

Sudan writer and political researcher Turstin pointed out that members of the Sudan National Congress in the army participated in the battle.

On the other hand, the writer and political analyst, Hafitz Kabil, talked about the situation of the former regime members participating in the Sudan army.

It is worth noting that the battle between the Sudan army and the fast support forces continued, and the conflict broke out in the capital of Kagoumum on the night of the Clamp Festival.

The two parties accused each other of the other party's prime minister began to fight, and the other party was accused of first -firstly, the opponent of the previous series of violations, and these shutdown agreements failed to successfully end the conflict since April 15th.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-29T04-29-18-08-00/28russia-fallout-4-lhvg-master1050.jpg)In order to consolidate his control of Russia, President Putin is taking action to impose a punishment for the rebels on the weekend of the mercenaries leader Yofgen Nihogo. However, Pryigon has a deep relationship with the rule of rule, making these efforts more complicated.

For the Russian leadership, the charges of the mutiny are important, especially considering that some important allies and sympathy of Pritigen are believed to be within the military and the government.

The fate of General Sergei Surovin has attracted great attention in Moscow, and Pleigon has publicly praised the senior military general. It is said that he had already been [knowledge] before the rebellion.(https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230628/russian-general-prigozhin-rebellion/); Since Saturday morning, he has not appeared publicly. Some Russian blogs reported that the authorities were investigating the military members who were associated with Porigo, but these reports could not be independently confirmed.

On Tuesday evening, Putin held a closed -door meeting with the Russian media figures in the Kremlin, which exacerbated the outside world's speculation on a wider range of blows. At the meeting, he showed all the gestures of the leader who was in grasp, saying that he was investigating the commercial contract signed with the Ministry of Defense of Russia.

According to the newspaper editor of the meeting, Constantine Remachokov said that in Putin's description, when Pricigen launched a 24 -hour rebellion last weekend, he has been paying attention to the whole process. "Putin said that he hadn't closed his eyes in a minute during the rebellion," Remachus said in a telephone interview with Moscow.

He said that after the rebellion, as Wagner seized a military facility and marched to Moscow, Putin seemed to be starting to focus on Prige's economic motivation. Putin also pointed out that the authorities will find out "who have signed documents and lobby for orders or uniforms and weapons."

"He is in -depth understanding of the contract signed by Pryo, as well as the flow of funds," Remachukov said.

In a public speech on Tuesday, Putin hinted that Pricig was implicated with the government. He said that the Poligon's restaurant giant earned about $ 1 billion from the military -supply contract in the past year. The government also spent $ 1 billion to fund the mercenaries.

The fate of Poligon's wider business has also been closely reviewed. On Tuesday, Syria, where the Wagner's mercenary activity frequently announced, officially announced a photo of the deputy minister of Russia's foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs meeting with Syrian officials.(https://sana.sy/en/?p=311811)The meeting was "regular political consultations between these two friendly countries."

On Wednesday, Putin tried to prove that all his work would return to normal. He flew to the Daggistan region in southern Russia to discuss domestic tourism issues and praised the development of the local Bailan real estate industry. The video released by the official media shows that Putin stepped to the city square and was welcomed by a group of people -such a picture seems to show that the president can still be supported by the public.

However, in Moscow, Putin's long -term response to the rebellion was still unpredictable. The Russian elite class is still fighting for loyalty and cutting the past connection with Pritigon.

Oleg Mattovicov, a political adviser to Russia and long -term pro -pro -pro -pro -pro -pro -Kirimlin, said who should be punished for "an extremely complicated issue" because of his relationship with Porigen.

In a telephone interview, he said that the target of the attention will not be those who only "take a group photo with Pryigo somewhere", but "actively covering him, still doing it now, and intentionally confronting the confrontation intentionally Presidential policy.

Matvicov acknowledged that he also cooperated with Pleigo about 10 years ago, but he said that when he determined that Porigon was "not stable in spirit", he stopped cooperative relationship.

Starting from operating high -end restaurants and hosting banquets in St. Petersburg in the 1990s, Perigo has established a network network. Not long ago, he also cooperated with General Surovin in Syria, when the Wagner troops were fighting there.

"I think they will ask him why he keeps silent" -the did not stand up to oppose Pryigon -Remachokov said when he talked about the general. "Is there any interest related to? Or is there any relationship?"

On Wednesday, the Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said the report of the New York Times about General Surovin's military proposal was purely "speculation", but it did not refute the report, nor did he explain to Surovigin any any of support. Earlier on Saturday, Surovijin appeared in a video that asked the rebels to stop acting, and there was no news since then.

Porigo has been hidden behind the scenes in his career. It was not until last year before going to the stage to shape himself into a tough mercenary leader, which is far more efficient than the traditional regular army. He often condemns and degrades the military leaders, such as Russian Defense Minister Shergai Shoygu.

In the past year, the Kremlin who tried to prove his patriotic enthusiasm has joined the camp's camp.

The son of the Kremlin spokesman Peskov once [bragged](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27493.5/4752637/)He joined the artillery force of the Wagner Group and won a medal for "combat heroic".

A party leader in the Russian rubber charter, Shelgi Mronov, also held a sledgehammer with a Wagner badge, a pile of skulls, and a hand -painted smiley.(https://twitter.com/mironov_ru/status/1616323559009443841)Essence This is the personal symbol of Pryo, because he supports the use of this sledgehammer to execute a Wagner soldier surrendered to Ukraine.But on Tuesday, Meroorov shook his body and became a resolute opponent of Porigen's rebellion. He asked him to investigate the "one group of VIP officials and civil servants". When Wagner entered Moscow on Saturday, these people came to the private aircraft terminal of Moscow Voukovo Airport to escape from Russia.

"This is the fifth column!" He on social media [write](https://t.me/mironovonline/7740), But there is no name. "The traitor of the motherland!"

Another question is, who spoke to Putin during the rebellion and who was silent. Moscow's political analyst Mihayer Venogratov on the Telegram social network [released](https://t.me/Vinogradov74/2559)His so -called "loyalty scores", precisely in the unit, counted the time for the release time of Putin, the governor of Russia to publicly support Putin on Saturday, and listed the list of 21 people who did not publicize the support.

In an interview, Venogradov said that his score should not be a reference for serious decision -making, but Mattovicov said he felt that the list could explain the problem.

"I probably have a lot of gains. For example, someone is not very reliable, and there may be different stances next time," he said.

Matwachek insisted that this abortion rebellion was a good thing for Russia, because the failure of the rebellion "strengthened the image of the authorities" and could also "prevent needle" to the future rebellion.

Newspaper Editor Remachukov said that although he [forecast on Sunday](https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230626/russia-war-putin-wagner-prigozhin/)Putin may not be able to run for re -election next year because the rebellion brought a blow to his image, but he had seen that when Putin wanted to show his strength, the Moscow elite, which had a relationship with the Kremlin, stood on Putin.

"Putin is now completely focusing on the information that conveys 'I can protect you' to the elite," said Remachukov. "I think there will be some very powerful actions to confirm this, because his entire logic is to show that this is a downright tradition."

Others believe that Putin will face continuous challenges, especially when the war is protracted, and the elites are accusing each other on the front line setbacks.

"This is a signal that indicates that the rule of the rule failed to properly respond to the pressure during the battle," said Moscow analyst Venogladov. "Especially in the past two months, everyone is waiting for Ukraine to successfully counterattack, and they are preparing to attack each other.

For the Russian public and ordinary soldiers, the impact of the rebellion brought to them is huge. The Wagner Armed Forces achieved the only recent battlefield victory for Russia, and has always been a blogger who supports the war -sometimes official media - With strong support, now they have become a treasonal thief.

Senior retired generals who have publicly opposed the war but did not leave Russia, Lyonid Ivashv, summarized the biggest problem that concluded the biggest problem shrouded above society and the army: "How can it become like this?"

"Many people can't understand what the government wants," General Ivasov said in a telephone interview. "The first question is, what happened to our country and the army?"

# Can China get out of the economy quagmire with the help of exports?

Description: In the context of the real estate crisis and weak consumer expenditure, Beijing is weighing whether it uses its huge power to use it as a huge force for exporters to manage the economy. But this approach may cause some concerns about the political rebound of countries that have been eroded by the country's economy.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-29T06-10-43-08-00/00CHINA-EXPORTS-01-lvgh-master1050.jpg)China dominates the sales of solar panels around the world and has caught up with Japan, becoming the world's largest car exporter. It even grows in global sales of low -tech products such as shoes.

Now, Beijing is weighing whether it is used as a huge power to use it as an exporter, trying to stabilize the stability that is obviously troubled by domestic problems [Economy](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230620/china-economy-stimulus/)——The real estate crisis, and after the strict epidemic restrictions in the past three years, consumers are unwilling to spend money due to weak consumption expenditure. This decision may cause response in the global economy and cause a rebound in trading partners who have been impacted by China exports.

Eswal Plazad, an economist at the University of Cornell University, said: "For the world's second largest economy, relying on other parts of the world to support its growth, it is not a good sign for global economic prospects."

Senior officials of the Chinese government said they planned to invest in the upgrading of the industry and promote the development of domestic business, not just the pouring of manufacturing products such as electric vehicles into foreign markets. However, economists said that other countries with consumer expenditure problems showed that there may be a wave of exports in China.

For China, relying on exports to promote growth is an effective way. Moreover, Beijing has a huge influence on the renminbi. Since mid -January, it has allowed the RMB to fall about 7%against the US dollar exchange rate. This makes the relative cost of Chinese products cheaper for buyers in other countries.

"A country's usual way to get rid of real estate decline is exports," said Brad Sezight, who had served as a maker in the Obama and the Bayeng government and is currently working in the Foreign Relations Commission.

China's real estate problem is deeply ingrained. A large number of vacant and unfinished houses have led to a sharp decline in the construction industry, and the construction industry is the largest industry in the country. Developers are trapped in debt. Last Friday, the two Chinese real estate companies suspended some overseas debts, and developers' stocks were sold in recent days. The decline in housing prices as the main assets of Chinese families has made hundreds of millions of families across the country more cautious in spending money.

At the same time, local governments spend huge spending during the epidemic, and now they are full of debt. It is difficult to provide residents with medical insurance and pay for civil servants' wages and pensions.

After the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries got rid of economic difficulties through exports. Ireland and Spain have taken the same practice after the collapse of the global banking industry in 2008 and 2009. In the following years, after the European financial crisis broke out, Greece was the same.

However, China may lead to political rebound in some countries. These countries are worried that the influx of commodities may erode the country's economy, leading to workers' unemployment, and enterprises to lose their market share.

Europe is an important market for various products in China. In Europe, officials and business leaders have stated that they are worried about China's surging trade surplus because they are already in a difficult deal of the influx of Chinese cars. The close partnership between China and Russia has caused alertness to China in Europe to rely on China. Russia is currently condemned by most European countries for invasion of Ukraine.

Deborah Elms, Executive Director of the Singapore Trade Consulting Corporation Asia Trade Center, said that China is increasing exports to Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia will further process these products and then transport them to Europe and the West.

However, China also faces a practical challenge: its trade surplus in finished products is so large (according to the calculation of Scze, it is equivalent to one -tenth of the entire Chinese economy), so it may be difficult to further expand.

According to data from the UN Industrial Development Organization, China's manufacturing output accounted for almost a third of the world.

It may be particularly difficult to achieve further growth at the moment, because some of China's largest export markets show signs of weakness after interest rate hikes.

"Compared with last year, the demand is weaker," said Zhou Shaopeng, a sales manager of a plastic pipe company in Hebei Province.

However, the recent depreciation of the renminbi may bring an export rebound. The government's announcement in recent weeks has emphasized the optimization of China's domestic trade, not limited to exports.

"China is figured out how to combine the two, how to integrate it may be more important than relying on foreign trade," said Zhan Yubo, director of the Western Economics Research Office of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Shanghai Social Sciences.

Experts said that although increasing exports will bring political risks, China still has room for expanding overseas sales in a field, which is new technology. With its strength in the field of electric vehicles, China's automobile exports have doubled in just two years, with an average monthly export value of more than 6 billion US dollars. Last month, the export value of China exceeded the smartphone for the first time.

In the past 20 years, China's large investment in electric vehicles and other innovative fields has brought about increase in sales and employment growth. The factories in the eastern suburbs of Shanghai are proof.

Tesla set up a giant factory in Shanghai. In addition to supplying the Chinese market, it also exported a large number of cars to Europe and Asia. GM also has large factories in Shanghai. It is a dense supplier network that supports these factories.

Kunyi Electronics, which is a dedicated tool for self -driving automobile R & D personnel, is one of the suppliers.

Green Energy is another area where China is booming. In the past three years, China's solar panel exports have doubled, and the average monthly export value has reached nearly $ 5 billion. Qin Yan, an analyst of the London Stock Exchange Group, said that although countries in the European Union, North America, and other regions are increasing production, China's exports are expected to continue to grow.But this change takes time. At present, China is still using money for investment, including the construction of more highways and railways, and many factories.

"Investment creates employment," Zhan Yubo said. "Employment brings income and wages, and income and wages will create consumption."

Peninsula TV reported on Tuesday (June 27) that when Fu Cong, the head of the Chinese envoy of the Chinese EU, was asked by reporters whether to support the Kiev authorities, including recovering the area occupied by Russia, Fu Cong said, "I don't think What's wrong? "

Fu Cong said: "We respect the territorial integrity of all countries. Therefore, when China and the former Soviet Union built diplomatic relations, we also advocated it."

"But as I said, these are historical issues that must be resolved by Russia and Ukraine through negotiations, which is our position." He added.

This statement has attracted attention, and senior Chinese officials generally do not make clear comments on Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday (June 28): "I don't understand the specific statement of Ambassador Fu Cong."

However, she said that in the Ukrainian crisis, "the Chinese position is consistent and very clear, and we hope that the Crimean problem can be solved through political channels."

Russian President Putin

In October last year, the United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution of the number of votes in favor of the 143 countries, the opposition of the five countries, and the abstain from the 35 countries, condemning Russia to hold its so -called referendum within the international recognized Ukraine border, trying to illegally annex some Ukrainian territory, and China voted for abstaining votes.

According to reports, Fu Cong delivered the above remarks after the 2023 EU China Chamber of Commerce Summit in the 2023 EU China Chamber of Commerce on June 16.

On Weibo, Fu Cong's statement caused discussion among netizens. Some netizens commented: "Is the wind direction going?"

Some Weibo netizens said: "For a year, Putin has no progress on the battlefield, and it should have been cut long ago."

Zhuang Jiaying, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science of the National University of Singapore, told BBC that this may be different views expressed by different Chinese officials, but in view of the uncertainty of the situation in Russia, this may also be a "test balloon".

"This remark from a ambassador -level person means that it will get attention, but it is still a low -level position for Beijing, and it can seem to be reasonably pushed." He said.

This is not the first time that Fu Cong has made a statement on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fu Cong said in an exclusive interview with the New York Times in April this year that China did not recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory, including the annexation of Crimea and Donbas.

He said that China did not stand on Russia in the war. The reason why did not condemn Russia's invasion because China could understand Russia's claim on defense of NATO invasion.

Fu Cong also diluted Russia and China announced the "unlimited" diplomatic relations, saying that "'unlimited limit' is just a rhetoric."

This is compared with the remarks of his peer and Chinese ambassador to France, Lu Shaye. In April of this year, Lusha was asked in a TV show whether Crimea belonged to Ukraine. Lushae claimed that this depends on how to look at the question and mentioned that Crimea belonged to Russia at the beginning, and later Nikitakhrushchev, the first secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, gave Ukraine.

The host reminded that according to international law, Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Lu Shaye said, "From the perspective of international law, it can even be said that those former Soviet countries have no effective international law status because there is no international agreement to determine their status as a sovereign state."

The Chinese Embassy in France later issued a statement saying that Lushaye's remarks were "not a policy declaration, but an expression of personal views in TV debate", "should not be over -interpreted", and the full text of the interview issued earlier issued by the shelves. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China also "extinguished the fire": China's position is "unchanged."

Zhuang Jiaying said that even if different Chinese diplomats have some "deviating routes", Beijing usually emphasizes that their positions are "not changed" in their official speeches.

"(This) can leave their positions to be controlled and coherent, or the impression of the incident is expected, even if the incident or behavior is different from the past model," he said.

Experts are concerned that the situation of foreign corporate situations may be more difficult. The picture shows Beijing Tiananmen Square. (Data photo)

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Congress passed the "Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China" on Wednesday (June 28), stipulating that foreign countries have harm to Chinese sovereignty, security, development benefits, and violations of international law. Agreement to counterfeit](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国智库新研究中国正学习使用制裁工具/a-65861451)And restricted measures.

The Foreign Relations Law will be implemented from July 1. The Chinese official media "Global Times" quoted Huang Huikang, a member of the United Nations International Law Commissioner and a Chinese legal scholar, stated that this law stipulates the purpose, conditions, and policy orientation of Chinese law in foreign relations. The principle of adopting countermeasures and restrictions is a milestone in China's foreign relations legislation.

"Nanhua Morning Post" reported that the "Foreign Relations Law" of Bao Shanbaohai pays special attention to national security and fights the so -called "American long -arm jurisdiction". Stimulating behavior.

George Magnus, a researcher at the University of Oxford, told the South China Morning Post that the outside world may regard this method as part of China's aggressive diplomacy, thereby expanding [Trust deficit between Beijing and Western countries](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/西方制裁失效中国监控技术版图持续扩张/a-65245519); Henrygao, a law professor at Singapore Management University, also said that the Communist Party has further concentrated power in the name of national security and this law, which further increases "the uncertainty of the Chinese business environment, because the Chinese Communist Party may take action based , Rather than consider it in accordance with the law.

### Foreign -related policy strengthened and implemented "Xi Thought"

Wang Yi, director of the CPC Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said on the 29th signature article in the People's Daily that the formulation of the "Foreign Relations Law" is a key measure to improve China's foreign rule -related system, and provides "strong legal guarantees for diplomacy with large Chinese characteristics." Wang Yi emphasized that during the current period of strategic opportunities and risk challenges in China, it is necessary to "continuously enrich and improve the legal" toolbox "of struggle.

The Global Times also pointed out that the law can "prevent, warn and deterrent the Western hegemony," and quoted experts saying that this law provides a rule of law weapon against unilateral dominance and abuse of "long -arm jurisdiction".

Gao Shuchao told the South China Morning Post that compared(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国出台反制裁法-在华外企考虑双循环/a-57980466)The "Foreign Relations Law" is more extensive and comprehensive; the "Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law" only pays attention to the legal retaliation measures for foreign sanctions such as refusing visas and frozen personal assets. One of the tools of foreign interference and long -arms jurisdiction.

Wang Jiangyu, a professor at the School of Law of the City University of Hong Kong, said that the "Foreign Relations Law" will act as the "protective umbrella law", from various aspects of standardization, summarizing China's foreign policy and behavior, and providing legal tools for "responding to external challenges".

Bloomberg pointed out that in fact, China has already had a record of retaliatory sanctions, such as [US companies selling weapons selling weapons in Taiwan](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国制裁参与对台军售的美国两大军火商/a-64724514)Essence The establishment of the new law provides additional legal support for such measures and reflects Xi Jinping's personal control of Chinese foreign policy.

Suisheng Zhao, a professor at the School of International Research, Denver University, believes that the new law does not seem to provide new anti -sanctions tools for Beijing, which only repeatedly repeated the Anti -Foreign Sanctions Law.

Zhao Suisheng analyzed that the "Global Security Initiative" and "Global Civilization Initiative" such as the "Foreign Relations Law" and other iconic policies made this document "more like Xi Jinping's foreign policy declaration and illegal laws." He commented: "This is through legal procedures to personalize Chinese foreign policy."

### Weibo public opinion response variety

Hu Xi, who was the editor -in -chief of the Global Times, made on Weibo. "Hands are used to hold the hands of others and embrace others, but when you encounter a challenge, you must quickly hold your hand into a fist." "China has a free legal hand" and said that this law "will definitely increase the price of the United States and allies infringe on China."

Many Weibo netizens agreed with Hu Xijin's view that "this is also a weapon for China to deal with the future struggle situation." And introduced this method "to make people have the law to rely on, and compare with the US emperor."

However, some netizens have expressed different views. Some messages said that the more fierce anti -the United States, the more fierce the United States, "explains that domestic contradictions are getting deeper and deeper", and "the country should face up to domestic contradictions and solve it down -to -earth." Another message stated that no matter what law was promulgated, "in the end, it still depends on the old method of reform."

However, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not clearly respond to which Chinese company, enterprise or department owned by the "civil unmanned airship".On June 20, U.S. Secretary of State Broskere, which ended in Beijing, said in an interview with the US media MSNBC that "the balloon incident should end." He said in an interview: "We do what we need to do to protect our interests. We said what we need to say, and we also clearly expressed the content that should be expressed clearly to ensure that this situation no longer occurs. Therefore As long as it no longer happens, this chapter should end. "

However, on the same day, the US President Biden's campaign in California called the Chinese President Xi Jinping as ["Dedicated"] at a campaign fundraising event.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登称习近平为独裁者-北京公开的政治挑衅/a-65987541)Essence In his speech, he said: "The reason why Xi Jinping was particularly angry was that when I shot down the balloon filled with two spy equipment, he didn't know where it was. This was particularly embarrassing for dictators. What happened, it should not be its destination, because the wind has deviated from the route. "

This expression of Biden aroused great dissatisfaction in Beijing.

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything.

The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November.

The personnel were wearing a mask, and the US personnel also put on the mask "with the customs" in addition to Blink. In March of this year, the picture reached by Beijing AIDS reached an agreement showed that in the three -party talks, all officials did not wear a mask, which was in sharp contrast to the picture of Beijing officials now meeting with Bollingken.

Until the last moment, whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese President and the Supreme CCP leader, would have been a suspense. On the eve of Brinken's arrival in Beijing, Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping met with former Microsoft President Gates, saying that he was an old friend, and said that he always hoped to be on the American people. Analysts believe that if Xi Jinping does not see Blink, then Sino -US relations will be even more worrying. If you see, the relationship between the two parties is expected to be further ease. Xi Jinping may also have a formal visit to the United States when he goes to San Francisco in November to participate in the APEC summit.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-29T10-48-47-08-00/00newworld-35-master1050.jpg)Sean Liang (Yin) started thinking about the "35 -year -old curse" when he was 30 years old. In China, people generally believe that white -collar workers like him will inevitably face the reality of occupational instability after the age of 35. This curse believes that in the eyes of employers, they are more expensive than fresh graduates, and they are not as willing to work overtime as fresh students.

Mr. Liang, 38, has changed from a technical support person to a private coach. For most of the past three years, he has been unemployed, partly due to the new crown epidemic and the downturn in China. But he believes that the main reason for unemployment is his age. For many employers including the Chinese government, he is too old, and most of the Chinese government will [civil servant position](https://www.chinagwy.org/html/kszc/gj/202210/42_543516.html)[Recruitment age limit](https://www.chinagwy.org/html/gdzk/sichuan/202301/75_556673.html)At [35 years old](https://www.chinagwy.org/html/gdzk/hebei/202306/62_592899.html)the following. If the "35 -year -old curse" is a legend, it is also a saying with some facts.

"Although I say that my fitness looks pretty young," he said in an interview. "But if people look at us, it belongs to the elimination of the society."

The Chinese economic recovery after the new crown epidemic has [stagnant](https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230620/china-economy-stimulus/), "35 -year -old curse" has become a hot topic on the Internet of China. It is unclear how this phenomenon has begun, and it is difficult to know its true level. But there is no doubt that China's employment market is weak, age discrimination is common, and age discrimination is in China [not illegal](https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/fggz/jyysr/jysrsbxf/202303/t20230330_1352927.html)Essence This is a dual blow for workers in their 30s and deciding for workers in their 30s, making decisions such as career, marriage, and fertility.

"At the age of 35, the suspect is old, and the retirement is small at the age of 60." A widely circulated post on the Internet wrote, which means that people who are at the best working age have no future.(http://news.china.com.cn/2023-02/10/content_85098811.html), People who are older may need to continue to work. The post then wrote: "Life is far away from houses, marriage, children, cars, blocked, poisonous. Happiness, freedom, and time are all yours."

Because he could not afford the rent of 600 yuan per month, Mr. Liang moved back from Guangzhou in southern China and returned to his hometown. He has not got married; the three -year -old codwood brothers who are similar to him have not got married. He said that only those who have stable jobs, such as working and being a teacher in government agencies, have the ability to form a family.

Chinese News Media last year [Quote](https://www.yicai.com/news/101780243.html)An official of a State Health and Health Commission responsible for the population policy says that the pressure of employment competition is even more why Chinese young people delay their marriage.

It is difficult to believe the employment data of the Chinese government. Employment statistics of the Chinese government include [only one hour every week](http://www.stats.gov.cn/zs/tjws/tjzb/202301/t20230101_1903672.html)People. According to this low standard, most of this year's urban unemployment rate is only slightly higher than 5%, which is better than 2019.

Data from the business community are different. According to the financial reports released by Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, the three largest Internet companies in China and the highest salary employers employed by employees in the first three months of this year were about 9%less when they recruited during the epidemic. Some of China's largest real estate developers lay off 30%, 50%, or even 70%in 2022.

"In the next few years, it will be the most severe moment of employment situation since the reform and opening up," Wang Mingyuan, an economist of Tsinghua University, is widely circulated [article](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/estate/integration/2023-06-04/doc-imyvuxqa9243358.shtml)It was written that he pointed out that if the employment problem is not solved, by 2028, the society may have a backlog of 50 million to 18 to 40 years old, and pointed out that this will "cause a series of deep crisis."

In 2022, the number of marriage registrations decreased by 10.5%compared with last year, and it was the lowest number since China announced the data since 1986. Last year, China ’s birth rate fell to the lowest point, and the population has shrunk for the first time since the end of the Great Famine in 1961.

Age discrimination affects all older workers, but people in their 30s may feel the deepest because they have suffered this discrimination for the first time.

Flynn Fan (Yin) began to be afraid of 35 years old at the age of 30. He knew that he might be eliminated a few years later, but before he was eliminated, the problem he faced was overworked.

He said that in the previous company, most of his colleagues were either single like him or married but no children. Overtime points are out of control. Mr. Fan said that he did not get off the class before 11 pm in three months in 2021. He began to take an anxiety drugs.

At the end of last year, he and most colleagues were fired by an artificial intelligence company in Shanghai.

In the past six months, he voted resumes to more than 300 companies and only got 10 interview opportunities, but unsuccessful. Now he is looking for a job with a salary of 20%to 30%lower than before. He also started to find a job in cities near Shanghai.

At the age of 35, he felt that he was still young. But he said that for society, 35 years old like a "plague."

Although Sissi Zhang (Yin) is 32 years old, some employers have said that she is too old. She presented a screenshot of recruitment information for a mother and baby supplies company, which restricted the recruitment age under 32 years old. In the past, some supervisors told Ms. Zhang that he would replace Ms. Zhang with three -month training young graduates.As a woman, Ms. Zhang also faces other discrimination. She had to answer the question of when her employer intended to have children from the age of 25. She replied that when she and her husband had no plan to have a child, the employer would ask her what their parents would think about their decisions.

Ms. Zhang is a marketing professionals. After being fired in September last year, she sent a message to more than 3,000 companies and voted resumes to more than 300 companies, but only got less than 10 interview opportunities. Last month, a small company finally provided her with job opportunities.

She accepted the job, but she was not excited or happy.

"I used to have expectations, that is, I think I need to be promoted, the salary increase, and a better life," she said. "I'm gone now, as long as I can survive and live."

advertise

She and her husband felt that they were unable to raise children. They had a mortgage to pay back. During her unemployment, they barely spent their lives, and at the same time worried that her husband might lose his job.

Their anxiety made them doubt whether the birth of children was fair to the children. Ms. Zhang quoted a popular online sentence: "If the child's birth is to inherit his own work and panic, then it is also a kind of kindness."

Mr. Liang, a 38 -year -old technician, also said similar words. He likes children, but does not believe that he has the ability to let children live a better life. Like many Chinese who grew up in the countryside, because his parents went to the city to work, he was raised by his grandparents. He doesn't want to let his child live this kind of life.

Besides, he first needs to find a job. Even before the epidemic, he was asked during an interview that why he was still applying for technical support at this age. He showed me the vacancies of the local provincial government: the age requirements of all positions are between 18 and 35 years old.

I said casually that the 35 -year -old must be like a heavy mountain, and Mr. Liang replied, "It's a cliff."

The US Department of Commerce stated in the report that "the updated valuation mainly reflects the repairs of the order and consumer expenditure", but it is repaired under some other fields such as non -housing fixed investment, and the partial repairs are repaired.

Consumption expenditure continues to lift the US economy. Even if the banking turmoil and the Federal Reserve Council (FED) continue to raise interest rates, the US economy can still open with strong performance this year.

However, as the Feds continued to raise the benchmark interest rate quickly to crack down on stubborn inflation, the US economic activities have shown cooling in the past period.

Authorities will study the definition and regulation of "fake news".

** Analysis: Government officials may also fall into the "Fake News" French Open **

Du Yaoming, former assistant professor at the Department of Journalism, Hong Kong Baptist University, said that since the implementation of the Hong Kong version of the National Security Law, the Hong Kong Government must restrain remarks and do not worry about no tools. In addition, the 23 "Basic Law" is about to legislate. Week chapter. Moreover, the Hong Kong Government also realized that once legislation, non -opponents may also fall into the French Open.

Du Yaoming: "When a pro -government or government officials talk about any false news, it is likely to resist the so -called 'fake news law', and most of the existing media are pro -Beijing. Small online media also step by step. 'Fake news The French 'is mainly for netizens' reposting information, but these also have the "incitement regulations' to regulate.

Du Yaoming believes that the current "fake news" legislation is relatively closed and backward countries, and countries and regions that are in line with Europe and the United States will believe that the problem of freedom of speech should be solved with freedom of speech. "News" is not helpful for revitalizing the Hong Kong economy.

Du Yaoming: "Unless (so -called 'fake news') directly damages the privacy, reputation of others, or the actual interests of the country are damaged, otherwise, it will generally solve the problem by public discussion. It is unfamiliar with foreign investors. Of course, Hong Kong's investment promotion will treat civilization and democratic countries priority. "

Although the Hong Kong Chief Executive Li Jiachao stated in an exclusive interview that it would not be a "fake news" legislation, it emphasized that the faster and better the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. However, if you only consider completing the task as soon as possible and ignore certain potential risks, you will "be unable to hold the constitutional responsibility and can't hold Hong Kong and the country."

On the 29th, the Sri Lankan Central Bank announced on the 29th, the government's government was trying to meet the conditions of the 2.9 billion US dollar rescue plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund in March of this year -this rescue plan appeared for the first time this first year last year. The economic recovery of the island nation with a default of foreign debt is very important.

Sri Lanka needs to carry out the long -awaited debt reorganization to help the country's goals set by the international currency fund organization, that is, the overall debt of its overall debt will be reduced by 2032(GDP)95%.

Last year, the foreign exchange crisis led the Sri Lanka government to the import costs of fuels, foods, medicines and other necessities, which led to extensive protests and led to the President Gotapa Rajapaksa, then president of the country.

Former Vice President of Sri Lanka Central Bank of China(In Avijwarden)Tell a reporter from the Peninsula TV station that this plan "is not a choice, but an inevitable action that the government has taken the current status of the fragile budget of Sri Lanka."

#### What are this plan?

* Sri Lanka Central Bank President Verashi said that according to this domestic debt reform plan, Sri Lanka Development Bond(SLDBs)The holders of the local US dollar pricing bonds will have three options. * The first choice is similar to the treatment of investors of the country's international sovereign bonds -the principal is reduced by 30%, the term is 6 years, and the interest rate is 4%. * The second option is similar to the treatment proposed by the bilateral US dollar creditors: it does not cut the principal, the term is 15 years, and there is a 9 -year width limit, and the interest rate is 1.5%. * The third choice is to convert the assets it holds into a tool for pricing at the local currency: 10 -year, Sri Lanka's common loan mechanism interest rate (SLFR)+1%interest rate, without principal discounts. * Sri Lanka currently has $ 12.5 billion in international sovereign bonds. It also has a bilateral loan of $ 11.3 billion.

* According to this plan, the local currency bonds (including pension funds) held by the retirement fund will be exchanged for bonds with long term (2027 to 2038), and the interest rate before its expiration is 9%. * The Treasury voucher held by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka will be converted into bonds due from 2029 to 2038, and the decreasing ticket structure will be adopted. This will be implemented in the second stage of domestic debt reorganization. * In view of the fact that the current banking industry has been under great pressure due to factors such as non -performing loans, reorganization of foreign debt, and high taxes, the banks and debt holdings of the banking industry are excluded from the scope of domestic debt restructuring.

#### Why is domestic debt restructuring important?

* Sri Lanka Financial Minister Silvadana said on the 29th that the reorganization will cover part of the country's $ 42 billion domestic debt. * This may promote the re -negotiations around the country's US $ 360 billion of foreign debt, including US $ 24 billion foreign debt held by bond holders such as China, Japan and India. * Sri Lanka sets the goal of completing debt restructuring negotiations before September this year to cooperate with the International Monetary Fund's first review of its plan.

#### What is the next step?

* Domestic debt restructuring frameworks will be submitted to the Sri Lanka Parliament for approval this Saturday. The Sri Lankan central bank hopes to complete the bond replacement of the pension fund before July this year. * Sri Lanka announced 5 days from June 29 to July 3 to curb any potential market fluctuations. Analysts said that banks will also allow any loss of bond sales in the third quarter of this year.

Among them, it is clearly ordered to establish and develop foreign relations with various countries on the basis of a China principle. Acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security, and development benefits have the right to adopt countermeasures and restrictions. According to analysis, the law shall also restrain all the political statements of all foreigners and approach the category of the National Security Law of Hong Kong. China will be more closed.

[** Xi Jinping announced "to launch an international struggle with the rule of law" **](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/zhengzhi/hx1-02162022083557.html)The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China voted on the 28th and approved the Law of the Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China. Article 34 of the law clearly orders, based on a Chinese principle, establish and develop diplomatic relations with countries around the world in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence; China has the right to take or terminate the necessary diplomatic actions such as changes or termination of diplomacy and consular relationships.

Article 33 of the Law also stipulates that it has the right to take corresponding countermeasures and restrictions on acts that endanger the sovereignty, security, and development benefits of the People's Republic of China. Article 8 stipulates that any organization and individuals who violate the law and engage in harmful national interest activities in foreign exchanges will be investigated for legal responsibility in accordance with the law.

** Scholars: Foreign capital restraint in politics approaching the Hong Kong National Security Law **

Ye Yaoyuan, a professor of international research lectures at the University of St. Tomas University, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia on the 29th and pointed out: "As long as most countries establish diplomatic relations with China comply with the principles of China, although there is a private relationship with Taiwan, they will not publicly recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. Not only the national level issues, but even private enterprises invest in China, and even travel to China, they must follow the principles of the first China and follow the leadership of the Communist Party. In this way To some extent, all foreigners have not yet reached the level of the Hong Kong National Security Law, but they have approached the category of the National Security Law of Hong Kong. "

In response to the background of this method, Ye Yaoyuan analyzed that US -China relations have fallen into stagnation, and have not improved in the Blingken visit. The Russian and Ukraine War has derived the Wagner's soldiers. Although the authorities have harassed foreigners through the inspection and investigation system in the past, the implementation of the "Foreign Relations Law" has a greater harm to China. In the future, it may be more locked. Foreign investors will slow down and exchange.

The official media Xinhua News Agency issued the content of the "Foreign Relations Law of the People's Republic of China", including the general rules, power, goals, systems, and guarantees, including 45 articles, including 45 items, and will be implemented from July 1. Article 27 of the Law stipulates that foreign aid adheres to the sovereignty of other countries, does not interfere with other domestic politics, and does not attach any political conditions.

The law also mentioned Mao Zedong's thoughts, "Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era", and "adhering to the centralized and unified leadership of the Communist Party of China in foreign countries."

Ye Yaoyuan pointed out that this is the "human law" based on the party's meaning, instead of law: "It writes Xi Jinping's thoughts inside and turns into how Xi explained, Xi Jinping's thoughts or Xi Jinping uses to define these concepts. It is entirely the party's intention. To put it bluntly, there will even be some lower -level people who will speculate and over -enforcement. "

"People's Daily" published a comment by Wang Yi, the director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Working Committee of the CPC Central Committee on the 29th, saying that the law "provides strong protection for the law of the law of the big country" is "the major achievement of implementing the diplomatic thoughts of Jinping in a legal form", Facing severe challenges, opposing hegemonicism and power politics, and improving legal tools for foreign struggles.

Shen Mingshu, director of the National Security Research Institute of Taiwan's National Defense Security Research Institute, accepted an interview with Radio Free Asia that for China, legal warfare from international issues, claiming to quote the law in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international rules, etc. Disputes can be treated in accordance with this law. For example, citizens have been persecuted internationally, and they have been withdrawn from Sudan to protect their own interests.

Shen Mingshi believes that the key is that Article 9 explicitly sets up the "central foreign affairs leadership agency is responsible for decision -making and coordination of foreign work, studying and formulating, guiding the implementation of national foreign strategies and related major policies and policies." The group is responsible for China's foreign policy.

Shen Mingshi said: "Xi Jinping, the head of the foreign affairs work group, the deputy team leader Wang Yi, and Wang Yi can best represent the CCP's foreign policy. For example, Qin Gang saw that Brinken had a good attitude, and Wang Yi was dressed as a black face. Speak ruthlessly. "

** Scholars worry that the law of the law will give China a source of chips from foreign negotiations **

Shen Mingshi mentioned that Article 38 of the Law made clearly order that "the state has the right to allow or refuse foreigners to enter the country and stay, and manage the activities of foreign organizations in accordance with the law." Social public interests and destroy social public order. "

Example of Shen Mingshi: "If foreign people and foreign organizations engage in illegal activities in China, they can directly drive, arrest or protest against the country. These companies are probably clear. What should be done should not be done. But for example, when the relationship between the two countries is harsh, will China take strong or persecution actions against some enterprises or organizations to force which country to negotiate with it. This is more troublesome. "

As a leader with international influence, Sanjes is keen to raise Spain's influence in the European Union, but announced on May 29 that the Congress election will be held in advance on July 23, causing all EU partners to fall off the glasses. One day before, the ruling party led by Sanjes was hit hard in local and regions.

Spain's rotation chairman will not be more influential than other members, but during this half -year, a opportunity to provide Spain can make major EU issues progress.

Sebastianmaillard, head of the French think tank "Jacques Delors Institute", told AFP that Spain, as a firm pro -European country, "as a rotating chairman, but" this is a kind of itself a kind of Risk, even if "there is no real derailment risk."

"Obviously, (the general election) makes the situation more complicated. We will see that the ministers go to the election and target their next rice bowl. They will have less time and energy to reach the agreement with other European ministers and their efforts." Sang Jie will be less. "Sang Jie will Scholars tried to convey a reassuring message, and he emphasized that "we have not reached the risk that the goals set up in advance before the election of the election in advance."

In response to the external criticism, he pointed out that France held the presidential election in April 2022, during the period as the rotating chairman.

When Sanjes set up a rotating chairman's priority policy in June, he hoped that Spain could complete the EU's immigration policy reform by the end of this year, and adopted important actions to reach a free trade agreement for the EU and the Southern Latin Market (Mercosur).

Sanjesli supports this trade agreement, but France has a reserved attitude towards this, especially in environmental concerns.

For European partners, the biggest problem is whether Sanjes can continue to power. In polls, Popular Party, the largest conservative party, has a high probability of victory.

A European diplomat pointed out, "If Sanjes has passed, they may have missed for a few weeks, but it is not too bad. But if he defeats, (pavilion) consultation, coordination and joint government discussion, I am afraid that it will be exposed to each other. "Time", the new Prime Minister came to power, etc., and the situation may be more complicated.

Once the proposed measures are implemented, Hun Sen will become one of the few world leaders sanctioned by this social media giant because of inciting violence on the platform. It is worth noting that former US President Trump was blocked by Facebook and Instagram for two years for praising the behavior of the riots of the Congress.

Robertson said, "This obvious inciting behavior that causes personal injury is exactly the approach that Meta should draw a line."

"The real problem in the region is that no institution or organization makes people like Hun Sen be responsible for their remarks and behaviors. Therefore, the Facebook platform clearly states that it is an international standard with international standards. Impact, and this is a completely appropriate approach. "

The content of the speech is the dispute between China and the United States, and China and the United States must have a battle. After careful inspection of Radio Asian Factive Inspection Laboratory of Liberty Asia, this speech was not from the mouth of Qin Gang, and someone was counterfeit. This recording is fake, but the question it talks -whether China and the United States must have a battle -it is indeed a very popular issue in recent years, it is worthy of our serious talk.

On May 30, Xi Jinping first proposed the concept of "extreme thinking" at the National Security Council's meeting. According to the Chinese Communist Party's "Learning Times", "Extreme Thinking is a way of thinking to push the problems or things to think in the limit state. What should I do? "In popular words, I am not afraid of 10,000, just in case. Some things are not likely to happen, but once it happens, it must be prepared to prevent it in case in case of preventing such things. If this happens, it can be good. response.

Extreme thinking does not refer to the extreme situation that is not good for yourself alone. It can also be taken the initiative to create a good situation that is good for yourself. For example I did not dare to use force, I didn't dare to use force. I was concerned about this concern. I did not dare to seize Taiwan at all costs. Extreme thinking is to seriously prepare to fight against Taiwan. This is also extreme thinking.

I remember that as early as 2005, Professor Zhu Chenghu, a professor at the National Defense University, spoke a ruthless words. Zhu Chenghu said: "If the United States decides to interfere with the conflict between the two sides of the strait, China will resolutely respond ... China will be prepared for all cities east of Xi'an ... Of course, the United States must be prepared. More than a hundred or more than two hundred or more cities may be destroyed by China. "Not long ago, another professor Fang Bing, a professor of the National Defense University, also said similar words. Fang Bing said: "We can take out 200 cities, do n’t want to play with the United States, and return to the Shichi era, do they dare?" The Professor Fang Bing also delivered a speech earlier, very humblely acknowledged in the short term. The hard power of the Chinese Navy cannot surpass the US Navy. Fang Bing said: "If you say that this time is 100 years and 200 years, it may be a time of time. If you say that this time is 10 or 20 years, then it is purely nonsense."

The speeches of Fang Bing and Zhu Chenghu look strange: On the one hand, they acknowledge that China's military power is not as good as the United States. Once China and the United States have started, China's loss is much larger than the United States. But on the other hand, they all appeared at the moment of fighting with the United States, and they seemed very confident. The mystery is that the Chinese government is an authoritarian government, and the Chinese government is not selected by the people. The Chinese government does not need to consider public opinion at all. Therefore, the Chinese government has no fear. The United States is not. The United States is a democratic country. Once the American people realize that if the United States involved in the war of the Taiwan Strait, it will be suffered from Chinese atomic bombs, and they will be destroyed by one or two hundred cities. Will they still agree to let the government intervene? In this way, can the CCP "soldiers without fighting"?

Here, we must completely reveal the huge disaster collected by the CCP's nuclear blackmail psychological war, that is, it is the life of the people, and first of all, it is the life of the people of the country. The reason for the CCP to fight Taiwan is nothing more than the country's unity. But the purpose of the country's unity should be for the happiness of the people. If your unity is destroyed by hundreds of millions of people, and the first and main Chinese people are destroyed, what is the legitimacy of such unity? If the Chinese Communist Party really wants to unify, it should change itself and make it attractive, so that the people of Taiwan are willing to unify; as now, it threatened by force and the life of the people's lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. What opposes is also the world's love and life must be opposed.

US President Biden Health has attracted much attention. For two consecutive days, the media has noticed that there are band -like indentation on both sides of Bayeon's cheeks. White House spokesman Bitz said Biden has begun to use sleep ventilators to solve the problem of long -term sleep injury.

Andrew Bates (Andrew Bates)Wednesday (June 28) said that since 2008, Biden's medical report has shown that he has a history of sleep suffix. He also used the "continuous positive air pressure sleep ventilator" (CPAP) on Tuesday (27th). He said that it is very common for people with this disease.

Reuters quoted a White House official who was unwilling to disclose his name that Biden had used a ventilator for a few weeks to improve his sleep quality.

The White House did not explain it in detail. What changes have happened recently in Biden's sleep injury or physical condition, so that the machine needs to start using the machine, nor did it explain how to overcome the suspension of sleep and breathing under the use of a ventilator.

The report questioned that the White House had never proactively disclosed the use of this machine before, and the president's disease had not appeared in the abstract of the presidential health status in February. In February this year, Biden had undergone a routine physical examination, and the doctor said that he was suitable for continuing to hold the presidential position.

The White House responded that the health of the president was open and transparent.

Biden, 80, is the oldest president in American history. [He is seeking for more than four years in the 2024 election](https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230425-1387247)And his age and health status have always been the focus of voters' attention. His doctor announced in 2019 that Biden was "considered to have sleep injury, but symptoms have been significantly improved after receiving sinus and nasal surgery."

The main symptom of sleep injury is that the breathing during sleep will be interrupted for a short period of time. Studies have shown that if it is not treated, it will cause forgetfulness, fatigue and drowsiness, and eventually lead to cardiovascular disease. Age is one of the factors that increase the risk of sleeping and respiratory suspension.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) China is facing "lost ten years"? The German financial professional online media Finanzmarktwelt.de published an article pointed out that the Dragon Boat Festival has not brought China's expected consumption boom, and China's domestic demands that the government has adopted more powerful stimulus measures. Some analysts even began to warn that China may have "lost ten years".

"Lost Decade" originally described in Japan, which had experienced a long -term economic miracle in the second half of the 20th century, and after the bubble economy was dusted in 1991, it led to economic stagnation.

The article published by FINANZMARKTWELT.DE wrote: "(China) The speed of economic recovery seems to be further slowing, and the hope of people's hope of improvement in the second half of this year is gradually disappearing. This reality puts Xi Jinping's pressure. The increase in GDP is not a simple statistics in China. It has high political significance at the same time. "

In the past two weeks ago, the State Council of the Chinese State Council held a meeting to study policies and measures that promoted the continuous recovery of the economy, and emphasized that "policy measures with conditions must be introduced and implemented in a timely manner." However, Chinese official media reports did not disclose specific information about these policy measures.

"Now it may need to wait until the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China in July to know the scope and method of stimulating measures that China may take in the second half of this year," the article wrote, "the dilemma faced by the Beijing leadership level is the two major system crisis, that is, the two major system crisis, that is, the two systematic crisis, that is, the two major system crisis, that is, the two systematic crisis, that is, the two major system crisis, that is, the two major system crisis, namely [Real Estate Industry](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国房地产迎来复苏信号但是/a-65420163)And [financial status of local governments](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国地方政府陷入债务危机/a-63331534)Essence Large -scale economic stimulus measures will further exacerbate these two systematic crises. At present, at least 3 provinces and many cities are on the edge of bankruptcy or have already gone bankrupt, and have to ask the central government for help. "

"Here, discussions about the launch of stimulating economic measures are also increasing in public opinion. Last week, at least three heavyweight Chinese financial publications were published in cover articles, requiring the state to give the real economy more support. Last Sunday Sunday. When the Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ning Jizhen said in the quarterly forum of the China Macroeconomic Forum of Renmin University of China that it should be early or late to introduce macro policies. The strength is small, 'It is necessary to prevent pessimistic expectations and prevent economic spiral contraction.

The article reads: "More and more voices warn that China is sliding to a state of long -term stagnation, similar to the" lost ten years' after the economic bubble economy of real estate bubbles in the 1990s. For a period of time, the average annual growth rate of Japan's economy is only 1%. Beijing does have stricter administrative control, which may avoid the sudden adjustment of real estate prices or the rupture of debt bubbles. Slowly fall into the same end. "

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) A large -scale questionnaire survey conducted by the University of Leipzig at Germany showed that the romant -right speech was specially recognized in eastern Germany. The survey with the extreme right -wing concept of the eastern people in Germany found that people were "particularly alienated by democracy" and less than half of them were satisfied with the daily life under the democratic system.

Researchers questioned 3,500 people from 5 Federal State in eastern Germany. The population of these five states accounts for nearly one -fifth of the total German population. The results showed that nearly half of the respondents demanded that Muslims immigrated to Germany; nearly 70%of them agreed that foreigners came to Germany to enjoy the German social welfare. In addition, anti -Semitism thought is quite common, and nearly one -third of the people said that the Jewish impact is too great.

Such political concepts are also reflected in people's election preferences. "Relevant results show that the Right -wing parties advocate many fit points among the general public with their ideology." Research authors said that among the supporters of the German options party, people with extremely right -wing concepts are the most concentrated.

Extreme right options are particularly successful in eastern Germany. Not long ago, in a county in Turinen, the option party candidate was elected as the county chief. This is [Optional Party won the first time in German local elections](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国极右翼选项党首次赢得区议会选举/a-66033353)Essence At the state level, the party may win in the three Eastern State Council elections next year. Optional Party has won a lot of support for the racist content of anti -immigrants and anti -Muslims for many years.

### Racial discrimination in German society

### Hope there is a strong leader

Why can the concept of extreme right wing be popular in eastern Germany? The research report believes that the reason is not the history of the communist autocracy of East Germany, but more about the popularity of "trust conspiracy theory" and the longing for "authoritarian countries". Most respondents hope to have a "strong leader" or "strong political party." 33%of them agree with the following sayings: "We should have a leader (Führer, in the historical context, referring to Hitler as the" head of state "-The translator's note), governing Germany with a strong wrist and pursuing benefits for everyone." Nearly A quarter of respondents said that the socialism of the Nazi nationalism also has a good side.

Researchers have also investigated whether people's views have changed in the past few decades. Because Whenever Germany occurs [racism](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/种族主义在德国势头渐长/a-53756672)After the bleeding incident, there will always be fierce social discussions, and it is no exception in eastern Germany. All localities have spontaneous assistance to refugees and advocate social diversification. However, the results of the questionnaire survey showed that the political concepts of the people in eastern Germany have not changed much in the past 30 years. That is to say, the concept of extreme right -wing has not increased, but maintains a higher level. This may explain why the party can obtain excellent election results in the east.

Research authors at the University of Leipzig believe that right -wing thoughts are very vigilant in the German East Minister. Because, if the statistics of criminal criminal criminals such as the arson of the refugee receiving center have shown that anti -democratic emotions in daily life may be transformed into violent operations.

The picture shows Wagner's mercenaries to guard the headquarters of the military region.

** Interviewer: Mr. Li Hengqing, economist and political critic **

In the past few days, the situation in Russia was shocked for a day, which was overwhelming and world shock.

Russia has changed its troops, and Wagner hired the mercenary to wave to the north, and the sword refers to Moscow. Come abruptly, and then abruptly retreated. A total of 36 hours before and after. History, like a slide, flashed in front of us. Confusted, thrilling and weird. What does it mean to Russia and the Russian and U -wars, especially for China?

**background**

The Russian Ministry of Defense announced in early June that all the non -defense forces that operations in Ukraine would sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense before July 1, and all the troops that would fight in Ukraine would be collected by the Ministry of Defense. For Perigerin, which has been in many countries in Africa, Syria, and even Ukraine, his Wagner's mercenary business is his positive business, and he is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense, which is to make everything to him, and he cannot accept it. Besides, he and the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoshigu, Chief of Staff Clasimov, has always been a dead enemy, and it is not allowed.

On June 23, which announced the mutiny, the Wagner Group leader Yevgenyprigozhin, the first "crossing the Red Line" directly questioned Russia's decision on February 24, 2022, accusing the Ministry of Defense "the Ministry of Defense's" The "Russian public and Putin and Putin falsely reported that Ukraine would attack Russia with NATO, which eventually led to the outbreak of war that" made Shaygu a hero "and a profitable war on the chaebol. Through this propaganda, Pritjin seems to want to win the indirect or direct support of the Russian anti -war, Ukraine, and even the West.

Light on June 23rd, Porigerjin said that his troops were attacked by the Missile of the Russian Ministry of Defense.

The next day, Porigjin waved north to Moscow.

Then, Wagner said that he occupied Rostov on the River River, which was occupied with Urida, and promoted to Voronezh, about 500 kilometers away from Moscow to occupy all its military facilities. Putin has published a national speech on this, acknowledging that the Rosteov on the banks of Don River is difficult, accusing the campaign of committing the crime of betrayal, and it will be severely investigated. But Wagner's Porigjin was unmoved, and he still drove directly to Beijing.

Putin and Pleigo shouted across the air, one had to severely punish the tradition of the country, and the other vowed to be clear. The civil war was released.

When Wagner was approaching Moscow 200 kilometers on June 24, the army stopped abruptly. The Wagner hired mercenaries led by Porigo no longer siege the city slightly, but returned to the camp and accepted the suggestion that the Organization had stopped acting in Russia and took further measures to ease the tension. Gejin can go to Belarus and will revoke its criminal case, with 5 agreements.

However, the agreement is not dry, but the progress is confusing, showing the temporary nature of the agreement. Just two days later, on June 26, it was reported that the investigation of the Porigjin rebellion continued; the Russian defense minister, which was reported, also publicly appeared on the same day. Then, it was finally reported that he gave up his investigation. Wagner personnel gave up his military equipment to the Russian army. Porigerjin entered the White Ross and retreated throughout his body.

Judging from the performance of Rostov and many Russians, Wagner has a certain foundation of public opinion, but in the Russian system, there is no foundation except for the long -term private relationship between Pleigin and Putin; Born, emotional things, impulsive recklessness, insufficient conspiracy. Once Putin weighs the advantages and disadvantages of the two factions, when the two sides must choose the same as the water and fire, they decide to abandon Porigo and stay in the National Defense Minister.

** Beijing's reaction **

The international media noticed that before the Poligon and Belarus President Lukashenko reached a Wagner armed forces to stop advancing to Moscow, Xi Jinping did not publicly support Putin, which is different from Turkey and other countries.

Within the dozens of hours from the 24th to 26th, Beijing has been silent. It is not difficult to imagine that Xi Jinping was shocked, and he might be difficult to sleep all night.

In fact, this is the consistent faction of Beijing. Because the incident was suddenly, it was difficult for Beijing to judge its results, so it would never rashly express, so as not to fall into an embarrassment and difficulties. The Chinese Communist Party is an opportunityist at extreme realists. The wait -and -see attitude of this mouse is particularly vividly performed when Su Dongpo changed from 1989 to 1991. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party was obviously frightened like a funeral test, but Deng Xiaoping said calmly, never take the lead, and the Chinese Communist Party calmed down and began to acknowledge the facts. The deal was gone, with a smile on his face.

Only after the situation is clear, will they state. Now, Wagner's soldiers have become large, and Porigeru cannot succeed in the coup. Therefore, they appeared in Shan Shan and said a few words that supported Russia's stable words without pain.

** About "Hou Putin Age" ** **

Although Putin took the support of President White Ross, it has now changed Wagner's soldiers. But after the mutiny, Putin was no longer the emperor, the political strong man was dead, and the empire had cracking a giant seam. It can be determined that the old Russian dream has been gone.

Although the Russian army may have a few weeks of return to the light, on the battlefield of Russia, Russia, where the country's luck gradually fails, and Putin, who is no longer the image of a strong man, is particularly losing the Russian army of the tough division Wagner. Turn.

And if the Russian army was defeated, Putin would inevitably step down to enter the so -called "post -Putin era". This is the result of the above general trend, which is difficult to resist.

Beijing has long been on how to cope with the ending. However, it has always been worried, retreat, and worry, and losing the evidence, hovering. However, the outbreak of Wagner's mutiny finally promoted the finalization of Beijing to take the first step. As a result, with the clicks of Russia's cracks, the rope of the China -Russia Alliance fluttered and loosened.

Beijing's face changes faster than turning the book.

** Beijing is close to Ukraine **Peninsula TV website reported on June 27 that in an interview with Peninsula TV and several other media, when the Chinese ambassador to Europe, Fu Cong, was asked if he supported the goal of supporting Kiev's recovery, including recovering all other Ukrainian occupied by Russia. In the region, the senior Chinese diplomat said: "He couldn't see" any reason to oppose all territories that it obtained when Ukraine was re -obtained in 1991.

French BFM TV also reported on the 27th that the Chinese ambassador to the European Union Fu Cong stated in the media that Beijing can support Ukraine to recover the goals of all territories assigned by its 1991 independence, including Crimi, who was swallowed by Russia in 2014, in 2014 The Asian Peninsula.

When the United Nations voted on the Crimean issue in 2014, China voted for abandoned votes.

It should be pointed out that China has never condemned since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. This position is completely different from the goals of all territories set by Beijing to support Ukraine in 1991.

** Cross the sea and end into Nanke a dream ** **

Global observers noticed that the couple head of Pleigo was the decades of relatives of Putin. They speculated that Xi Jinping, who claimed that Wu Tong Taiwan, was not ruled out. Now seeing the case of relative rebellion when the Russian and Ukraine war are adhered to. Is loyalty to be unquestionable?

To what extent the Wagner soldiers have affected the determination of Beijing's savage martial arts in Taiwan? Former New York Times reporter Edwardwong issued a Twitter, quoting the Xinhua News Agency reported that the Rebellion of the Wagner Group said, "In the entire Russia and Ukraine War, if one thing can promote Xi Jinping to consider the attack on Taiwan, then It is the anti -water of the Wagner Group **. "**

Some friends think that the structure of China and the Russian military system is different, and whether the military's possibility of mutation is also different, thereby inferring that the incident similar to the Russian Wagner's mutiny cannot happen in the CCP.

This inference lacks persuasion.

Of course, there is no private mercenaries like Wagner, but this kind of mutation is only one of the many possible mutations. There are still many possible ways. As we all know, Xi Jinping is extremely sensitive to loyalty in the PLA. He has been solemn many soldiers, and now he has reinforced the troops in the army. Looking back at the history of the Communist Party of China, it is not necessary to say that Peng Dehuai and Lin Biao's incidents in the Mao era. General Xu Qin of the Deng Times first faced the slaughter of the city and could not resist his life. After the ax sound, the sword and sword shadow is mostly located. Recently, the Liu Asia case has been confusing, so as not to let others be beautiful ... In short, the rumors are in four, and they are not enough. Xi's mouthful of dug out the so -called "two -sided people", and endlessly emphasized the loyalty to his personal loyalty. What mentality of the language of this kind of grass and trees has conveyed?

In the past, the international community and his think tanks warned him that, in view of the strength of the US -Japan -Taiwan South Korean Federation, if force attacks Taiwan, it will be inevitable; if there is no speed, the army will become a high probability event. Undoubtedly, the Russian Wagner soldiers have greatly strengthened his mentality.

** Test Beijing's decision power **

Xi Jinping's eyes saw Putin's chariot facing a difficult battle, and the people on the car began to split and tear. What he was in the mood was not difficult to imagine.

When the soldiers changed, Porigo directly questioned Russia's decision to invade Ukraine on February 24, 2022. This is a kind of political allegations. Obviously, it is no longer explained by the "Qingjun side". Purigo, who has more than 30 years of personal relationship with Putin, has suddenly revealed the ambition of "the desirable generation". This is the difficulty of human heart. Can Xi Jinping still sleep firmly?

"This dramatic mutiny has undoubtedly sounded the alarm to China. In the face of the internal and external changes, especially at any time, it may be a historic Russian and Ukraine war because of occasional incidents to test the decision of China."

I believe Beijing is in the long exam, and people will wait and see.

What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Today, talk about the latest progress of the situation in the Taiwan Strait. As the world's attention was concentrated at the dramatic results of the Wagner Group mutiny, the restless situation of the Taiwan Strait began to rise. ** approaching the adjacent area ** On June 24th, the PLA-10 fighter aircraft crossed the middle line of the Strait and arrived at the 24th neighboring area of Taiwan (known as the Diandian District). In addition, five warships cooperated with the joint combination of the combination of the combination of the combined police patrol. Many media reports in Taiwan stated that two of the secondary fighters were near the Penghu Islands 24 neighboring area. In an interview, Zhang Yanting, deputy commander of Taiwan ’s Air Force, pointed out that the Penghu Islands are strategic domains (defense or military strategic bases that must control and ensure the area and water areas where tactical points are located). The "Tianju Army" is deployed here. The Chinese military plane comes here to find a break in the airspace around Taiwan. The neighboring area of the 24th 线 west of Taiwan's Linghai Line is Taiwan's training airspace. Chinese fighters approaching this, showing that Taiwan's training airspace is being compressed. Zhang Yanting believes that in the future, China's battle opportunities will gradually approach Taiwan's 12th airspace. At present, there are human -machine testing first, and then various types of drone invasion and interactive use will be dispatched. Now it is tentative, and it will be normal in the future, and then become comprehensive; except for Penghu, the Huadong area of Taipei and the east coast of Taiwan will face the threat of this gray area. Taiwan Defense Minister Qiu Guozheng pointed out in the Legislative Yuan in March this year that in August last year, Nancy President NancyPelosi visited Taiwan. The Chinese warship was approaching Taiwan's Linghai Kili Line and a 24 neighbor area. He judged that he would get closer this year, and even broke into the territorial waters that were approached to 12 浬. It seems that the situation is developing in this direction. At present, the way of Taiwan's corresponding offices is to use military aircraft and warships that use interception missions, as well as the shore -setting missile system to implement monitoring. Keep high restraint and do not initiate the "first blow" to avoid rising things. What should I do if the opposite shore must be in? The bottom line of Taiwan is to defend the 12 浬 台湾 台湾 and its airspace. After the warning is invalid, Taiwan will exercise any aircraft and HNA entity invaded in China "self -defense counterattack". However, this is already a decision. In August last year, the PLA comprehensively broke the central line of the Strait. Today, Taiwan's training airspace line is also facing huge challenges. If you cannot keep the neighboring area, Taiwan ’s coastal defense and air defense will be reduced to the 12 -collar sea line. The Taiwan Strait will lose the meaning of the sky. The military confrontation between the two sides of the strait is no different from the confrontation between Ukraine before the war. This is the most severe issue in Taiwan's current defense.

Western intelligence agencies analyzed that the Russian mercenaries Organization Wagner Group's head of Pryoo was appointed as the original catalog planning, including arresting high -level Russian military, but was forced to take action in advance after the plan was leaked.

The Wall Street Journal quoted the unnamed Western officials, saying that Perigen originally planned to catch two when Russian Defense Ministers Shohgu and Chief of Staff Glasimov visited the southern region of the southern region of Ukraine, but were safe by the Russian Federation The bureau discovered two days before the plan, and therefore had to temporarily formulate another plan.

The commander of the Russian National Guard, Zolotov, also told the media on Tuesday (June 27) that the authorities knew his intentions before Porigen act, and stated that the specific information of the mutiny will occur from June 22-25 It was leaked from the Pricig's camp.

Some insiders said that Western intelligence agencies also analyzed the intercepted electronic communications materials and satellite images, [Purigo's plan was discovered very early](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/world/story20230625-1407822)Essence They believe that the Poligon's plan is based on his believe that some Russian armed forces will choose to join the rebellion.

Western officials said that they believed that Perigen had conveyed his intention to senior officers, which may include Solovica, deputy commander of the Ukrainian military operations in Russia, but was not sure whether Surovin was informed of the Federal Security Bureau.

U.S. officials believe that Surovin may understand the demands of Poriger's altitude, but it does not necessarily support or participate in its actions.

Surovijin was the first senior commander of the Russian army to condemn the Wagner's soldiers and urged Prig to stop. The troops he commanded were also the only army in the regular army to attack Wagner.

Kremlin spokesman Peskov also refuted [New York Times "report on Wednesday's press conference on Wednesday's press conference](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/world/story20230628-1408824)The report refers to the guess and gossip.

Western intelligence agencies said that Pryiga was forced to take action on June 23 after the plan was leaked, and successfully occupied the key command point Rostov-on-Don. They analyzed that the Wagner forces can easily occupy the southern Russian cities with a population of 1 million and large military airports, indicating that some regular army commanders may participate in the mutiny.

After occupying the command point, Perigon sent thousands of people to the capital Moscow, and he was stationed in the local area and waited for the regular army to join his rebellion. Although the troops heading to Moscow had little obstruction on the road, there was no evidence that any regular forces joined them.

According to the analysis of the Western Intelligence Department, if it was not for President Berlos Lukashenko, this mutual change may eventually evolve into an armed confrontation in Moscow.

There are also US officials that the help that Pricig's expectations will not be achieved in Moscow have not been achieved, forcing him to abandon his plan to continue to march into the capital.

The US Navy / AFP US Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States earlier this year loaded the US -made equipment, helping mobile photos, videos and other information. The US defense and intelligence agencies analyzed the fragments of balloons discovered and shot down 5 months ago with the Federal Investigation Agency. U.S. officials said that the analysis found that the balloon is full of commercial equipment made in the United States. Some of them can be bought online, and there are more special Chinese equipment to collect photos, videos and other information to China. They concluded that the purpose of the flight was to conduct spy activities, not the weather monitoring in Beijing. These officials said that this balloon mixed ready -made and specialized equipment is a creative attempt for monitoring in China. The Wall Street Journal report also said that Chinese officials have stated that if US investigators will publicize the balloon reports to the public, Beijing will be forced to respond to a strong response, which may cause high -level exchanges between the two countries to derail.

In response to the purpose of the court's establishment and the first batch of information, some of the initiatives were interviewed.

On June 28, the "CitizensCourt" issued an announcement through Twitter. The announcement pointed out that the court aims to popularize the common sense of modern civilization and encourage civic society to participate in the form of case trials, thereby promoting the peaceful transformation of autocratic society towards civic society. Cases tried by the Citizen Court will show social justice, not to preach hatred; intended to build, not fighting.

The announcement also pointed out that the CCP authorities want to suppress the persecution of citizens, and the government and employees supported by taxpayers have failed to fulfill their obligations to protect citizens; the judicial organs are abducted by the CCP and cannot perform their judicial functions independently. Infringements and malfeasances implement trials.

** Sponsors: Maintaining citizen rights to prevent the CCP from persecution **

Li Dabin, one of the sponsor of the "Citizen Court" and a human rights lawyer in the United States, told this station: "Now for citizens, they are only unilaterally judged by the regime. Space. So, we consider making our own voice from the perspective of citizens and advocate our rights. "

Wu Shaoping, a human rights lawyer who participated in the establishment of the "Citizen Court", said that such an independent court can incorporate the crimes of the CCP authorities into trials and reveal it. A civic court can prevent the CCP from persecution of human rights. "

Guo Baosheng, a person in the United States, also believes that the establishment of this citizen's court is very meaningful: "It can further pressure the human rights of China and promote the change of China's human rights. Exile lawyers can continue to engage in the human rights movement overseas."

** Respect the facts to show justice ** ** Citizen court pursuing more credibility **

In 2020, the "Independence People's Court" in London, England has been investigated by the CCP's strong criminals such as Falun Gong practitioners, and ruled that "the CCP committed anti -human crime [] [](https://www.soundofhope.org/term/145142)"Xing; in 2021, another independent court also made a final judgment to determine that the Chinese government's riots for Uighurs constituted racial extinction and anti -human crimes. The results of these rulings caused a strong response in the international community.

Wu Shaoping said that the reason why the independent court has credibility is multiple reasons: First, the case is fair and public during the trial of the case itself to ensure the legitimate procedure rights of all parties and promote the case to obtain a more objective and fair result, thereby being recognized by the society; At the same time, there must be professionals to participate in the quality of the case trial.

In response to the newly established "Citizen Court", Wu Shaoping said: "The" Citizen Court "has no private interest, it is for human rights and humanity, and for the establishment of civil society. Because it is based on justice, we believe that this kind of trial can also be possible. Get more public recognition. "

Li Dabin emphasized that the "Citizen Court" is a court supported and composed of citizens. Trial cases must respect the facts and show justice, not for political struggle. Considering the principle of fairness, they even planned to establish a defense mechanism when the defendant was absent.

Wu Shaoping also pointed out that although the Citizen Court does not have the binding power of legal enforcement, it can also play a great role: "In the future, it will be a evidence of the CCP's infringement of human rights for the international court or the United Nations human rights agencies to investigate the laws that they should bear in the international community. Responsibility, if it can achieve and achieve this purpose, it is equivalent to the CCP to have certain execution. "

> "Announcement of the Citizen Court"> >> Citizen courts were initiated by a group of overseas exile lawyers, which aims to popularize modern civilization and encourage civic society to participate in the way of trials of cases. Civil courts tried the case to show social righteousness without preaching hatred; intended to build, not in the struggle. > ...

Wu Shaoping told this station that although China also has a so -called jury system, it is completely different from international universal procedures: "The Chinese juror system is directly selected by the official, and the trial of the case is also selected by them to participate. But they do not play any practical role, and they really determine the facts of the case and the case of the case are judges. "

Wu Shaoping said that the international universal jury system is an independent composition, and the jurors are generated by citizens, and the lawyers of the two prosecutors are also selected by the CCP of the jurors. All citizens are obliged to register as jurors. They want to determine whether the parties are charged with crimes, and specific sentencing and judgment are determined by professional judges.

** The first batch of "Citizen Court" to promote three cases **

The "Citizen Court" announcement lists three cases currently being promoted, including the case of He Fangmei and Li Xin, Wang Quanzhang and Li Wenzu, and Li Lebin's shooting Xu Chunhe.

Among them, He Fangmei is the initiator of the "Vaccine Baby Home" rights protection group. For many years, she and her husband Li Xin have been petitioning their rights for the eldest daughter who disabled for the vaccine. In October 2020, He Fangmei was sentenced to a psychiatric hospital for protesting in front of the Hui County Government of Henan Province and was sent to a psychiatric hospital. In March 2022, He Familia opened the trial in the first instance, but he was not sentenced to the time of his detaining; her husband Li Xin was sentenced to 5 years in prison and is still serving in prison in Jiaozuo Prison.

The victims of the "709 major arrest" Wang Quanzhang and his wife Li Wenzu have been continuously suppressed by the authorities in the past two months, and the family has been forced to move 13 times. At present, Wang Quanzhang and Li Wenzu have been besieged by unidentified personnel for more than two weeks, and their rented houses still insist on staying behind after being broken and power -off, causing attention at home and abroad.

In addition, Li Lebin's shooting Xu Chun's case was a shooting case in May 2015 in the waiting room of the Qing'an Railway Station in Heilongjiang Province. At that time, Li Lebin, a police officer of Xu Chunhe and the police station on duty, had a conflict, and Li Lebin shot and killed him. Because Xu Chunhe had a petition experience, public opinion widely questioned whether Xu Chunhe was killed by police interception.

The "Citizen Court" is currently collecting relevant evidence of collecting the above three cases from the public, and called for the CCP organizational secretary and members of the CCP -related CCP -related CPC to the case, as well as government officials to stop suppressing the persecution of citizens, fulfilling the function of protecting citizens' rights and interests, and negatively Execute the instructions to infringe human rights.

Guo Baosheng, a person who travels to the United States, said: "Because the previous calls of the international community were generally general, (condemnation) the Chinese government was over. They now set up a court to go to each case and specific person in charge. It is pointed out in detail that the grass -roots officials who serve the CCP are also a deterrent. "Guo Baosheng hopes that the" Citizen Court "will be associated with the international community's legal community in the future and further expand to have a greater influence.

[![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-29T15-57-00-04-00/000001.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/8-06292023155710.html/@@images/image)The Chinese online clothing brand SHEIN, which is popular in the European and American fashion market, officially submitted an IPO listing application to the New York Stock Exchange. According to Reuters, clothing retailers with a market value of up to $ 60 billion are being reviewed by US regulatory agencies for alleged allegations such as forced laborers. Hitchin has the largest overseas listing IPO since the listing of Didi in the United States in 20021. According to previous reports, Higin tried to set up outlets in Europe and Mexico, and established a local supply chain to decentralize excessive dependence on Chinese factories. Nevertheless, most of Higin's supply is still from China, because Chinese factories can deliver in just 10 days to meet Western consumers' pursuit of fashion. This is the fast supply chain operation that allows Higin to defeat international brands such as ZARA and H & M. However, because of the tight relations between the United States and China, Hipin was also affected by some. What this clothing company is widely criticized is plagiarizing other designer works. In addition, Xiyin is also criticized by environmentalists to encourage over -consumption and may use products that are forced to manufacture in Xinjiang. Responsible editor: Rao Yiming

Surovin was called the "Doom General" by the Russian media because of his ruthlessness in the war. He was an experienced general of Russia in the war of Chechen and Syria and was awarded by Russian President Putin.

"Moscow Times" quoted two sources closely related to the Russian Ministry of Defense on the 28th, saying that according to a source who did not disclose his name, the reason for Surovin was detained that he chose to stand to Wagner during the rebellion during the rebellion. The group leader Yofgen Nihigo is appointed.

According to the Moscow Times, the Russian military blogger Vladimir Romanov also reported on the 28th that the news of Surovol was detained. In addition, the Think Tank "Institute of War" headquarters in Washington Special Economic Zone reported that another Russian source claimed that Surovijin's military "subsidiary" was "accused of participating in the rebellion."

The newspaper pointed out that the Russian Ministry of National Defense has not published any comments on the detained reports of Surovijin.

The Institute of War reported on the 28th that a well -known military blog website in Russia claimed that after the Wagner forces tried to enter Moscow and arrested senior military leaders in the country, the Russian military command was carrying out "large -scale cleaning operations."

The Institute of War reported that the military analysis channel "Rybar", the military analysis channel of the Kylimlin on the social platform Telegram, pointed out that the Russian Ministry of Defense is "testing" for loyalty because some people in the Russian military command are suppressed by the rebellion and their actions of the Wagner rebellion and their actions. It shows obvious "excellent indecision" and their "support" of this private mercenary.

"Rybar" pointed out that the rebellion of the Wagner forces "has become an excuse for large -scale cleaning against the Russian armed forces."

The Institute of War pointed out, "If the Russian authorities do have detained Surovin, the Kremlin may use Surovijin and its subordinates as sinful sheep to publicly explain why the Russian military and internal security agencies in Russia have poor response to the rebellion. And provide reasons for thoroughly cleaning the Russian military leadership. "

"The Institute of War cannot confirm any speculation about changes in the command of the headquarters, but it is clear that the armed rebellion continues to have a significant impact in the information field."

#### Peskov: "A lot of speculation"

Reuters quoted three U.S. officials on the 28th as saying that it is well known that Surovijin sympathized with the rebellion of Wagner, but it is unclear whether he actively supports the rebellion.

Surovijin has always supported Pricigen, but the Western intelligence department is not sure whether he helped the rebellion in any way. According to Reuters, after the rebellion, Surovijin publicly urged the Wagner armed personnel to return to the base last Saturday.

The New York Times also reported that Surovijin had learned that Pryigon was planning a rebellion, and the Russian authorities were investigating whether he was Perigen's co -conspiracy.

These mercenaries have reportedly come to a place within 200 kilometers from Moscow.

According to the Russian News Agency, the Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said on the 28th, "There are many speculations and rumors around these events."

He said, "I think this is one of them" and refute the report of the New York Times.

Peskov added that the Russian army and the people "support President Putin during the uprising."

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko confirmed on Tuesday that Parigen, the leader of the Wagner Group, has arrived in the country as one of the contents reached by its mediation, and this agreement barely prevented the Wagner mercenary facing Moscow. Joining. Lukashenko said Wagner's armed personnel have obtained an abandoned military base that can "place tents and think about what to do next."

####  Putin was weakened

German Prime Minister Schultz said on the 28th that the failure of the failure weakened Putin's power, but it is unclear whether this will make the Kremlin more likely to withdraw from Ukraine.

During an interview with the German Broadcasting Corporation (ARD), Schultz said, "I really believe that he was weakened because these facts indicate that the current authoritarian power structure has cracks, and he is not like he has always claimed that he has always claimed So firmly in power. "

Schultz pointed out that he did not want to participate in how long he would stay in Putin, and said that the purpose of Western to support Ukraine was to help him defend himself, rather than the change in Russia's regime.

Schultz said, "The Wagner Force is a very radical military unit around the world, and its role in Russia for the Ukrainian war is also very specific."

Author of this article, Sarahcook, senior adviser to China Issues of the Freedom of the International Human Rights Organization,)It is said that Chinese diplomats have always published articles in media in various target countries to affect local public opinion. Alternatively, China has invited foreign journalists and scholars to visit China, hoping that they can speak for the Chinese government or enterprise. There are signs that China has found these key characters or institutions through local public relations companies to carry out its overseas proposal plans. In some cases, bribes, pressure and corruption are essential parts of it.

The META's supervision committee of Facebook parent company Meta asked for a half -year of Facebook for Cambodian Prime Minister Honor, saying that he violated Facebook for banning violence threats. Hun Sen showed that he would stop using Facebook and switched to use instant communication to communicate with the public.

Reuters reported that Hun Sen, who has led Cambodia for nearly 40 years, was accused of using Facebook to intimidate political opponents and obstructing criticism of him. The Hunson government denied these charges.

The Meta's independent supervision committee accepted a case in March this March this year, saying that Hunson violated Facebook's rules on violence and incitement. Some netizens reported a video that appeared in January. Hun Sen said in the video that those who accused the Cambodian People's Party who were led by the Cambodian People's Party in 2022 should file a legal lawsuit, otherwise they will face the assault of political party supporters.

The committee pointed out that Meta did not withdraw this video to make a mistake, and asked to delete that video from Facebook. In a statement, Meta said that the committee will respond to the suspension of the suspension of Hunson's account after review.

Hunson's Facebook account has about 14 million followers, and the number is not far from the population of approximately 16.5 million in Cambodia.

Hun Sen posted on Telegram on Wednesday (28th), "This is better than Facebook ... From now on, I will only publish information on the Telegram channel, including live broadcast."

However, he also said that he would continue to use social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram and was establishing a Tiktok account. Government spokesman said that the Prime Minister switched to Telegram purely because the platform was easier to use and could contact more people.

Zoharian, Speaker of the House of Representatives of Malaysia, revealed that he never thought he would become the speaker of Congress. He said that according to his previous career plan, he hoped that one day would become a state minister in one state.

Zohari Adu is a member of the Parliament of the Qianjiandian District of the People's Justice Party, a member of the former Ge Lun District, and the leader of the Opposition Party of the Geeper State Parliament. On December 19 last year, he was elected as the Speaker of the House of Congress for 147 votes. His opponent is Lasi, a former Glass City Congress, a member of the National Alliance. Lasi received 74 votes at the time. This voting is regarded as the comparison of the unity government led by Prime Minister Anhua and the opposition State League's strength in Congress.

In an exclusive interview issued on Thursday (June 29) on the Internet media "Malay Post": "No (I don't expect to be a speaker), I want to be a minister of the state. In fact, I am in this (Last year's election) I met Anwar before nomination. "

He told Anhua at the time: "I don't intend to run for Congress. I have completed the work in the (Congress) Parliament. I lost twice and won three times, so I want to be a minister. I tell him directly. "Okay." So I didn't participate in the election last year. "

Zohari said that this is why the Chairman of the Gillian Youth League, Doufick, replaced him and ran for the election of the Parliament of Shuangxi. Daofik was the son of Zohari. Last year, he won in the Pentagon with a majority of votes with a majority of votes in Pentagon.

Zohari revealed: "However, the Prime Minister (after the Anwar election) called me. He said that Congress needed me and he ordered me to return to Kuala Lumpur."

Zohari said that he quickly adapted to the work of the Speaker. This was because he had served as a parliamentarian who had been about 15 years before, and before the election from 2013 to 2022, he served as the party whip of the Parliament of the Justice Party. This made him very familiar with The rules of discussion and the operation mode of the House of Commons.

The Six State Council that Malaysia's upcoming election will be disbanded on July 1. Malaysian scholars believe that the voting date of this election may fall on August 5 or August 12. This is because the voters had a good mood in July, and most of the Muslims who went to Maca's pilgrimage had returned to China.

The Date of Muslims went to Melta's pilgrimage every year from December 8th to 12th, this year from June 27th to July 1st. Because the number of scholars traveling to Mecca every year, many Muslims go to Macca's pilgrimage within about a month before and after the above date.

According to the election law, the state parliament must be held within 60 days after the dissolution of the state parliament. Jilandan is the first state of the dissolution of the State Council in the six states. If the Grandan Dan State Council will be calculated on June 22, if the six states will vote on the same day, the state election must be voted at the latest before August 21.

The Samililan State Council will dissolve on Friday (July 1) and is the last state of the dissolution of the State Council in the six states. According to the convention, the Election Committee will meet in the National State Council to decide the nomination day and voting day within one week after the dissolution of the State State Council.

In November 2021, Malacca State Election, March last March election, and the national election in November last year, the voting days of Malaysia's last three elections have been dissolved for more than 40 days after the parliament. If the Danzhou Council will be calculated on June 22, it may be a vote day on August 5 or 12. If the 14 -day campaign period is calculated, the nomination date may be July 22 or 29.

Mohammed Daofi, a senior lecturer at the School of Political and Administrative Research at the University of Malaya, told the Xingzhou Daily that he believed that the six state elections were most likely to vote on August 5. This was because in addition to the above calculation, it was also happy that the voters had just received the salary of July in July. "The people's mood will definitely affect the voting behavior. In addition, most Muslims have completed the pilgrimage and returned to China."

Huang Jinfa, a political scholar of Malaysia Shuangwei University, told the Xingzhou Daily that August 5 or 12 may be voting days. He said that in order to avoid being accused of deliberately letting pilgrims miss the election, the government may choose to vote on August 12, because most of the Muslims who went to the pilgrimage at that time had returned to China.

He said: "But (voting date) may also be on August 5, because the election committee generally wants to reserve a two -week buffer period. To avoid the re -election that a candidate's sudden death and re -arranging, it can meet the constitution '' ' The provisions of the election 'within 60 days after the parliament disbanded.

People familiar with the matter revealed that one of the most common artificial sweeteners in the world, Asba Sweet, may be listed as potential carcinogens by the international cancer research institution under the World Health Organization.

Popular drinks such as Diet Coke and Zero Sugarsnapple, as well as snacks such as Extra chewing gum, all contain Aspartame.

Reuters quoted sources that international cancer research institutions may list Asba sweetly on July 14 as potential carcinogens.

This decision by the International Cancer Research Institution was finally determined after holding an external expert meeting a few days ago. External expert meetings aim to evaluate whether certain substances have potential harm based on the evidence that have been published.

However, some of the past decisions of the International Cancer Research Institution have faced criticism, saying that it has caused unnecessary panic. The international cancer research institution has attributed the work and edible red meat to the "potential carcinogenic" category, and the use of mobile phones is also listed in "potential carcinogen".

The decision of the International Cancer Research Institution does not consider the intake that may cause cancer. Joint WHO and Food and Food AndagriduRETURE ORGanization ’s Expert Committee on FoodadDDITITIVES (JECFA) of the Foods of Food and Agriculture Organizations of the WHO (JECFA) will measure the appropriate safety intake. JECFA is also reviewing the use of Asba this year, and it will also announce the conclusion on July 14.

A spokesman for the International Cancer Research Institute said the conclusions of the International Cancer Research Institutions and JECFA were kept secret before July.

He said that the role of the two institutions is "complementary." The conclusion of the International Cancer Research Agency is "an important step in understanding the nature of cancer", and JECFA "conducts risk assessment to determine the probability of carcinogenesis such as carcinogenic cancer under specific conditions and contact levels."

Russian parliamentarian revealed that the leader of the mercenary group Wagner, Porigen, was told that Wagner could not continue to fight in Ukraine because he refused to sign the contract and handed Wagner's control to the Ministry of Defense.

According to Reuters, the Russian National Duma National Defense Commission Chairman Caltapolov went to Cultural on Thursday (June 29) that the fuse of the Wagner's mutiny was that Perigo did not agree that the Ministry of Defense requested his regiment to sign a contract.

He said: "A few days before the army changed, the Ministry of National Defense stated that all formations that performed combat missions must sign a contract with the Ministry of National Defense. Everyone began to execute this decision ... Except Perigo Ren."

Porig launched a mutiny last Friday (23rd), but a day later, he agreed to the end of the White Ros President Lukashenko.

Porigen said on June 11 that Wagner's mercenaries will not sign any contract with the Defense Ministers Shogu, saying that the other party does not have the ability to manage military units.

Caltapolov said that after Porigen refused to sign the contract, he was told that Wagner could not continue to fight in Ukraine, and therefore did not receive national funding. He also pointed out that Porigon had committed the crime of betrayal because of "too high ambitions", money, and "excitement".

A Japanese technology company cooperated with a university in Tokyo to develop a network application. As long as the "shoveling officer" uploaded a cat's photo, the artificial intelligence system could know whether the cat was in pain.

Agence France -Presse reported that Japanese application developer Carelogy cooperated with the School of Biological Resources Sciences of the University of Japan to collect 6,000 cats to study their ears, noses, beards and eyelids.

Developers subsequently used the small differences between healthy cats and cats that suffered from pain due to difficulty discovery.

After the developers, enter this information into the artificial intelligence detection system, and then use about 600,000 photos uploaded by the user to further improve the detection skills, and finally develop the "cat painful detector" network application.

The person in charge of CareLogy Tosaki Takina told AFP that the accuracy rate of this application is more than 90%today. "We hope to help cat owners more easily judge whether pets need to see veterinarians at home."

Some Japanese veterinarians are already using this application. Qi Gang reminded that "the artificial intelligence system needs to be more accurate in order to be used as a standardized tool."

This network application launched last month, so far there are about 43,000 users. Most users come from Japan and some from Europe and South America.
