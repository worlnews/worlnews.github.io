Microsoft Microsoft disclosed on Tuesday evening that Chinese hackers invaded the US government email account and tried to collect American intelligence. The New York Times reported that people familiar with the matter said that the attack was targeted, and hackers were targeted at specific accounts, rather than large -scale invasion. Adam Hodg, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said that the confidential network has not yet been affected and the evaluation of the amount of information obtained is still ongoing.

Microsoft said that a total of 25 organizations including the US government were attacked by hackers. This gang uses a fake authentication tool to access personal email accounts. Microsoft also said that hackers have invaded some accounts at least a month before being discovered. The complexity of the attack and its targeted indication shows that this hacker gang is either affiliated with the Beijing intelligence department or working for it.

Charlie Bell, executive vice president of Microsoft, wrote on social media, "According to our evaluation, opponents are mainly engaged in spy activities, such as entering the email system to collect intelligence."

Microsoft did not disclose the names and institutions invaded by hackers. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department stated that it has been investigated, and immediately takes action to ensure the security of its computer system.

On December 8, 2008, before the publication of Charter 08, the CCP authorities arrested Liu Xiaobo into prison, and one year later, he sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting the crime of subverting the state power". This judgment shocked many people. "Charter 08" is very gentle, and there are more than 300 people in the first batch of signed, but only Liu Xiaobo was convicted in prison, and his sentence was 11 years. At that time, I speculated that most of them were the CCP authorities who wanted to exile Liu Xiaobo overseas.

In 2008, Professor Hao Jian of the Beijing Film Academy made a video interview with Liu Xiaobo. This is Liu Xiaobo's last video interview during his lifetime, which is very precious. In this interview, Liu Xiaobo mentioned that during the period of 1996-1999, he had the opportunity to exempt from labor camp and leave China to the West. Liu Xiaobo said: "In 1998, Clinton visited, and the Chinese government asked me (Liu Xiaobo) to talk to the United States in the name of medical treatment. To be honest, if you really sentence me for more than ten years, like Wang Danwei Jingsheng, I am, me Maybe you will consider it. To be honest, this three years have passed, and there is one and a half years left. How can I survive. "

I wanted to come to the authorities to see Liu Xiaobo's interview. This is why the authorities have sentenced Liu Xiaobo for 11 years. Because the purpose of the authorities is to exile Liu Xiaobo overseas. The authorities believe that if only three or five years are sentenced, Liu Xiaobo will insist on the jail; if he is sentenced to more than ten years, Liu Xiaobo will consider whether it is an exile as an overseas exile like Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng.

But the authorities made a wrong abacus. Because of this moment. In 1998, Liu Xiaobo, if he was sentenced to more than ten years in prison, will mostly agree to accept exile; but in 2008, Liu Xiaobo, even if he was sentenced to seriously sentence, would rather sit and wear it at the bottom without accepting exile.

From 1998 to 2008, Liu Xiaobo's thoughts and realms had an amazing improvement.

On January 13, 2000, Liu Xiaobo wrote in the letter to Liao Yiwu: "... Compared with the characters in other Communist darkrs, we can't call the real tough guy. For so many years of great traged There is still no moral giant, similar to Harveil. In order to have the right to selfishness, there must be a moral giant to sacrifice selflessly. The will. History is not necessarily inevitable. The appearance of a martyr will completely change the soul of a nation and enhance the spiritual quality of people. Gandhi is accidental, and Harvey is accidental. The improvement of people is done by these accidents. You cannot expect the collective conscience of the public, and can only rely on great personal conscience to condense the cowardly public. In particular, our nation also requires moral giants. Infinite, a symbol can evoke too much moral resources. "

In 2002, Liu Xiaobo wrote a long article "The Poverty of the Chinese Folk Opposition -Sixty -33rd Anniversary". The article said that the loss of freedom of Aung San Sui would rather sit in the bottom of the prison and never exile. The development of faction itself and the support of the international community provide sufficient morality and organizational resources. Liu Xiaobo is regrettable that in China, under the extreme horror of the June 4th slaughter, a large number of representative characters of folk morality can escape or be forced to exile. History originally gave some people to become such symbolic characters. The opportunity, but for this kind of reason, they failed to become such a character, which caused China to fail to produce enough to consolidate the people like Sanahanov, Harvel, Wavina, Mickey Nik and Aung Shan Suji to condense the people A moral consensus opposition leader. Liu Xiaobo firmly believes that China needs such a model of morality. This means that as early as 2000, Liu Xiaobo had made up his mind. If destiny puts the opportunity to become a model or put it on him, he must try his best to take it.

We can speculate that the authorities sentenced Liu Xiaobo for 11 years at the beginning, and the purpose was to force Liu Xiaobo to accept exile overseas. We can also speculate that the authorities must reveal their intention to Liu Xiaobo more than once. It was just rejected by Liu Xiaobo. Later, the authorities gave up this intention. The authorities were afraid of Liu Xiaobo sitting through the bottom and walking out of the prison alive, becoming Angshan Suji in China, so they took extremely vicious means, which caused Liu Xiaobo to be cancer. When he was released from prison, he died in prison.

Liu Xiaobo failed to become a Chinese Sukhan Suji in China. Liu Xiaobo's death made him a great martyr. Compared with Sanhanov, Harville, and Aung Shan Suji, Liu Xiaobo set us a eternal model of eternal morality in his own way.

In this regard, Wang Wenbin responded that Fukushima's nuclear pollution water is still uncertain whether it can be dealt with.

He said: "If some people think that Fukushima nuclear pollution water can be consumed and swimming, we recommend that the Japanese side use the nuclear pollution water to make good use of them for drinking or swimming instead of being row into the sea and worrying about the international community."

Regarding the strong response of the Chinese side this time, Chinese netizens have supported it and agreed that "why do you not keep it by himself since it is a good thing?"

When the 71 -year -old fisherman Ono Haruki removed his fishing at Komigou in Shinachi, it was already bright. Ono is the third -generation fisherman and has been in Shinachi for half a century. It was only 55 kilometers north of Fukushima First Nuclear Power Station. In 2011, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world occurred there.

### Tragging fisheries

The radiation released during the disaster during the reactor caused the fisheries in the area to be completely stagnant. It was not until 12 years later that the price of fish slowly recovered. Ono believes that Tokyo Electric Power Corporation will be "unbearable" that the plans of polluting water into the sea again. He was worried, "We are afraid we will return to the origin again."

An employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. raised the water sample in front of the camera. These water is treated, filtered and diluted. Dongdian and the government claim that it is safe now. However, it contains trace. Although this radioactive homogenin is considered relatively harmless, fishermen are worried that the water will be discharged into the sea again to destroy their business again.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-12T04-52-51-00-00/000187231_piclink.jpg)The US Supreme Court made a major judgment at a time, as if throwing a bomb from the bunker, causing a masterpiece of gunfire in all directions. It is often necessary to let the bullets fly for a while to see which ones hit the targets, which are missed, which are wrong, and even put the guns in the sky. After the "Student's Fair Admission Organization Organization for Harvard Cases", the scene where the bullets were fluttered. As soon as the sentence was sentenced, large and small media reported immediately, saying that "the court has overturned equal rights measures." All kinds of comments are flying, and those who support the judgment cheer and defeat the discrimination fairly. A few hours later, President Biden said on TV that "this court is abnormal."

After a few days of bullets, people can calm down, carefully read what the judgment is written, which policies have been denyed, and which new policies have created space -the judgment of the Supreme Court is often not only negative. The old policy is denied, but the problems in reality still exist and must be replaced by new policies. The "Judgment" of this case plus the approval and opposition from several judges, as long as 237 pages. It is worth noting that, unlike the previously Supreme Court's judgment of Affirmative measures, the "Judgment" written by the chief judges of Johnroberts does not mention "equal rights measures", but it is said that Harvard's "racial conscious admission policy" The equal protection clause that violates the 14th amendment of the Constitution is because it treats candidates according to race identity. The "Judgment" did not clearly overthrow the previous judgments that supported equal rights. Instead, the Supreme Court has never allowed schools to treat candidates according to racial identity.

In the statement, the content of the NATO Summit ’s communiqué involved in China ignored the basic facts and was full of" Cold War Thinking "and" ideological prejudice ".

According to China, as a regional military group, NATO, in the case of continuous deterioration of the current international security situation, not only did not reflect on its own responsibilities, but blindly accused other countries and continuously stain outfinger affairs. The statement also stated that China resolutely opposed NATO's "East Asia Pacific" and emphasized that "any behavior that harms the legitimate rights and interests of China will be resolutely fighting back."

According to many media analysis, the NATO announcement 15 times mentioned that China can be regarded as the tough position that the organization has always adopted to China.

Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou, China. Low cost is the main advantage of Foxconn's participation in the cooperation of the international industrial chain.

** Apple iPhone supplier, Foxconn, a subsidiary of Taiwan Business Hon Hai Technology Group, has withdrawn from a 19.5 billion US dollars of investment projects in cooperation with Indian petroleum leader Vedanta. The project was originally planned to build in India in India. One chip manufacturer. Less than a year ago, the two companies announced their plans to invest in the chip factory in Gujarat, Gujarat, the Prime Minister of India. Some analysts said that this is a setback to India's development of the science and technology industry. **

However, an Indian government minister said that this will not have any impact on the push plan of the country's chip manufacturing. Hon Hai's headquarters is located in Taiwan. The company issued a statement saying that both parties realized that the project was not progressing quickly. The company also added: "We cannot successfully overcome some challenging gaps, as well as external problems that have nothing to do with the project."

Foxconn told the BBC on Tuesday that the decision to withdraw the capital was reached under the "mutual agreement" with Wida. After Hon Hai withdrew, Weidata had completely owned the joint venture. In addition, the company also said that it will continue to support the Indian government's "Madein India" ambition. Weida, headquartered in New Delhi, said that they have "cooperated with other partners to establish India's first (chip) foundry".

### Indian Semiconductor Development In the event of frustration?

However, Paultriolo, a global consultant company, told BBC: "Foxconn's sudden exit of Foxconn was a considerable blow to India's semiconductor development." He explained that "the obvious reason for this withdrawal is the lack of clear technical partners and the development track of joint venture. Both parties lack the rich experience in developing and managing large -scale semiconductor manufacturing business."

However, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Rajeevchandrasekhar, said that Foxconn's decision has no impact on India's semiconductor manufacturing goal. Chandrasecar also added that Foxconn and Willda are the "important investors" of the country, and they will promote their strategy separately in India.

The Indian government has been formulating a strategy to support the chip manufacturing industry. Last year, India established a $ 10 billion fund to attract more investors to invest in the field, looking forward to reducing India's dependence on foreign chip manufacturers. The flagship plan launched by Modi in 2014, "Made in India", is to help the country transform into a global manufacturing center that can match with China.

In recent years, several other companies have announced their plans to establish semiconductor factories in India.

India has been formulating strategies to support the chip manufacturing industry. In 2022, India established a $ 10 billion fund to attract more investors to invest in the field and look forward to reducing India's dependence on foreign chip manufacturers.

Last month, Microntechnology, a US memory chip giant, said it would invest $ 825 million to establish a semiconductor assembly and testing plant in India. Micron said that the construction of the factory in Gujarat will begin this year. It is expected that the project will directly create as many as 5,000 tasks and indirectly bring another 15,000 employment opportunities to the region.

End of podcastIntel former executive executive Vinod Dham is now a member of the Indian Semiconductor Mission Consultation Committee. He accepted an interview with the US media Businessstoday this year that India still faces some important challenges before becoming a key role. He said that, for example, to build a successful wafer factory, electricity cannot be faulty, because some plants for manufacturing high -end chips need to supply power without failure, and to avoid the risk of natural disasters, especially earthquakes.

However, Dam analyzed that in India, the infrastructure has not yet fully developed, and the customs clearance sometimes takes a few days or even a few weeks. Therefore, India must apply to the airport of the key components that are exported by India, or the customs set up in manufacturing facilities, assembly,, assembly, and Next to the cluster of testing and packaging facilities. In addition, Dam also emphasized that the factory area where the semiconductor factory and the back -end (assembly, testing and packaging) facilities are located should be protected by law, and it is necessary to prevent strikes and consider "unnecessary vacation regulations" to ensure that the Indian chip factories are competing for competition in competition. The fierce global semiconductor industry is competitive: "A advanced chip factory may take five years to enter comprehensive production. Not only does it require comprehensive financing to complete the work on time, but also the labor force must work all year round to ensure the chip factory factory to ensure the chip factory factory Can be put into operation as soon as possible. "

Analyst Srishti Khemka published a research report in the US Independent Think Tank "Council On ForeignRelations" stating that although huge investment in semiconductor manufacturing, lack of electricity, water, and mobility The bureaucratic bureaucracy has made India unable to become a semiconductor power on the basis of existing. She explained that although India has a strong talent pool and political will, it is not easy to create a feasible semiconductor ecosystem, and today's chip power has spent decades to develop to mature, and India is managing the "Indian manufacturing" plan. And providing difficulties in promoting the basic resources required for the semiconductor system, so that he is not optimistic about the efforts of Delhi's expansion of semiconductor development: "If there is no solid policy framework to fully solve all these problems, India cannot achieve the mission of a global semiconductor power. "

She said that water and energy are the other two key resources of semiconductor production, and both of the existing resources in India are insufficient. The Modi government has made some progress in improving groundwater management, but it is unclear whether these measures can be and how fast they can succeed.

Dham believes that although India currently has tens of thousands of design engineers cooperated with the world's top semiconductor companies, in terms of component physics required by the chip designed by these design engineers, and in terms of process and technical knowledge, India has almost no talents in India.

# Goldman Sachs: The second Indian economy in 2075? Experts

Author: None (Language: zh)

Publisher: None

Time: 2023-07-12T12:10:00Z

Description: Goldman Sachs recently issued a prediction that India is expected to become the world's second largest economy in 2075. The country's economic growth is expected to reach 5.9%this year. However, some experts believe that more than ten years ago, the world had made too optimistic predictions on India, but it was not fully realized.

[ ![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T12-10-00Z/57918401_303.png)](https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/66201124/57918401)(Voice of Germany Chinese) Investment Bank Goldman Sachs published an article on its website on July 6, predicting that in 2075, [India](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马斯克莫迪相谈甚欢-特斯拉将尽快在印度建厂/a-65988335)It will become the second largest economy in the world, second only to China, and tied in front of the United States, the euro area and Japan.

###  Demographic Dividend

The main reason for the prediction of Goldman Sachs is, [Indian population](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/人口超越中国的印度能获得人口红利吗/a-65471911)Continuous growth, huge labor potential. Santanusengupta, an economicist at the investment bank, said: "In the next 20 years, India's raising ratio (that is, the ratio between the non -labor age and the working age population) is the lowest in the world One of the regions. "He said that India should seize this opportunity to strengthen the production capacity of manufacturing, continue to serve the growth of the service industry, and the growth of infrastructure.

### Economic Digitalization and Aadhaar identity system

Goldman Sachs specially said that India has achieved a flying over economic digitalization, the so -called Aadhaar biometric identity system. This system includes 1.4 billion people in the country. Through this system, public services can make public services easier and targeted, and also help small and micro enterprises to obtain loans, thereby promoting growth. According to the "Washington Post" columnist and CNN host Fareedzakaria in April, the system now covers 99.9%of Indian adults. Using this figure, you can open a bank account or transfer within a few minutes. The system is operated by public institutions.

![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T12-10-00Z/64916040_401.png)Aadhaar biometric identity system has also triggered a debate on personal privacy and data protection

### Low labor participation rate, especially women

The analysis of Goldman Sachs also pointed out that India's risks are that it cannot effectively increase the proportion of labor participation. According to analysis, the proportion of labor in India has continued to decline over the past 15 years. Especially women. Zakalia's article also pointed out that in the past 20 years, Indian women's employment ratio has decreased from 30%to 23%.

Another opportunity facing India is the green economy. The country announced zero emissions in 2070, and half of the energy from 2030 came from non -fossil raw materials.

### The Chinese economy is five times the Indian

However, the German Economic Weekly published a guest article from Harvard Kennedy College Graham Allison on July 11, and believed that the praise to India was too early.

He pointed out that although India's economic growth rate in the first quarter of this year reached 6.1%and China was 4.5%, it should be cautious about overnight forecasts. He quoted Zacalia's article, saying that around 2006, India's growth was even more than 9%. At that time, the world was optimistic about the Indian economy, and even the Indian Minister of Trade predicted that the country's economy would surpass China soon. However, this is not exactly the case.

Today, the Indian economy is ranked fifth, behind the United States, China, Japan, and Germany. China's GDP is five times that of India.

![](ConvertedIMGs/dwzh/2023-07-12T12-10-00Z/57105844_401.png)It is said that the ratio of Indian women's participation in the employment market has decreased from 30%to 23%in the past 20 years

### China technology and production efficiency are higher than India

Professor Ellison's article pointed out that in addition, China is still leading India in science and technology. Of the top 20 technology companies in the world's top 20, four are Chinese companies, and no Indian companies are on the list. In terms of artificial intelligence, China is also the only country that can compete with the United States.

In addition, Professor Ellison believes that China's labor efficiency is higher than India. Goldman Sachs also pointed out that the huge population of India is obviously an opportunity, but how the challenge is to effectively use these labor. This means providing skill training for them while creating employment.

### Obstacles: Surname system, complex ethnic and religious relationships: Create employment from bottom to top

Professor Ellison quoted the comments from former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to India's development, saying that Lee Kuan Yew has been looking forward to [India](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美财长访问印度推动伙伴合作-减少经济依赖/a-63729145)Powerful ability [compete with China](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/拜登和莫迪瞄準中俄-稱美印是親密夥伴/a-66009193)Essence However, Li Guangyao later discovered that due to the requirements of India's surnames, bureaucracy, and elite classes, they were unwilling to face the requirements of complicated ethnic and religious groups, so it was difficult to meet the due economic efficiency. Zakalia's article also said that the Muslim groups in India accounted for one -seventh of the country's population, but continued to be persecuted.

However, Zakalia also has confidence in India. He believes that India is able to popularize smartphones and the Internet. At the same time, with the AADhaar identity recognition system, it can help hundreds of millions of small and micro enterprises to obtain loans, thereby hiring two more employees, which can increase tens of millions of employment opportunities. This way from the bottom up is completely different from that of China from top to bottom-for example, 100 new factories to increase tens of thousands of jobs-to increase tens of thousands of jobs-.

Risk.

This article written by Alexander Görlach pointed out that [now European countries re -position their policy of China -that is, the position of free trade has been higher than politics in the past 30 years](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧盟19国呼吁减少制药工业对中国的依赖/a-65501791)This kind of behavior further shows that "the global decision -making world order may be about to end."

The comments said: "Since Ukraine's illegal attack, the world has seen the NATO countries unexpectedly united. In the Pacific, all partners in the United States have alliance with Washington and promised to invest more funds in military. So as to ensure the safety of their people. All countries are worried that Chinese leaders Xi Jinping wants to verify his "power of power is righteous" on their territory. The first thing that is the democratic island country that has never belonged to the People's Republic of China. "

With the lessons of the Russian and Ukraine War, countries around the world are more cautious about China. However, if the Taiwan Strait really broke out, can the previous sanctions on Russia applied to China? The article takes Germany as an example, quoting the report data from the Kirl World Institute of Economics (IFW): "China and Taiwan occupy a dominant position in the import of 221 products in Germany, and most of the import shares exceed 80%. Therefore, the Taiwan Strait of the Taiwan Strait Conflicts will be a double disaster for German trade. "

The comment wrote, "even if the sources of alternative supply of rare earth cannot be found in the short term, German and European politicians are still trying to" decide "or" risk ", so as not to be blackmailed by China in an emergency." However, the author also cited China. In the past, economic sanctions on Australia, threats to Sweden and Lithuania, and "restricted Korean order" issued by China after purchasing new weapons technology in South Korea as an example, reminding European countries, especially exporting countries, and Germany must "be the reality as soon as possible in reality as soon as possible Geopolitics is prepared for psychological preparation. " The article states: "The Chinese government has demonstrated how it treats countries that dislikes dislikes." And calling on its tough stance to China, it must also consider its risks.

West Vedes will (WDR) reporter Felixwessel from the NATO Summit at the NATO Summit's "Why should we follow Lithuania" article written that Lithuania, who is next to Russia and Belarus, has always been alert Before Ukraine was invaded, the Lithuanians had warned us on Russia. When we were still busy laid a pipeline for Beixi No. 2, they were trying to get rid of the dependence on Moscow. As early as 2014, Cremi, that is, Crimi, that is, Climi, that is, Climi, that is, Cremi In the year of the occupation of Asia, Lithuania opened a liquefied gas pier. This is far from "German efficiency" far from catching up. "

Nevertheless, the author said: "The good news is that we can learn something from Lithuania. That is: do not commit a similar mistake to Russia in response to China."

The article refers to the risk of conflict between the Taiwan Strait: "If the Chinese army really attacks Taiwan, what will happen? Taking our car manufacturer as an example, their 40%of their sales come from the Chinese market. How will our economy cope with this consequence ? Politicians have been talking about the "de -risk" to China, [Daniel Cologne’s German Institute of Economics (IW) recently studied the opposite conclusion of some raw materials, basic chemicals and electronic components -not seeing diverse diverse seeing diverse Signs](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/智库-德国在某些领域严重依赖于中国产品/a-65986796)Essence Lithuania Foreign Minister Langzbris described the scene in his eyes: this is like we are building the next Beixi No. 2. "

"[Lithuania not only relys on China as much as we, but even reducing dependence.](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/分析立陶宛为何逆行挑战中国/a-60107283)Since Taiwan has established a representative office in Lithuania in the name of "Taiwan", Lithuania has faced political pressure and economic punishment from China. However, in the face of this non -democratic economic power, Lithuania with a population of only 2.8 million has not shrunk, and this trick finally works.

** Experts: countries have clear consensus on China's threats **

Very Senior Researcher Thomas Xinjin of the Atlantic Council of the American Think Tank(Thomas Cynkin)Tell this station, "From the perspective of China, they will worry that European countries have expressed their increasing interest in participating in Asian security issues. China is more inclined to exclude them."

Xin Jin also pointed out that there are differences between China hope that NATO and the Asia -Pacific allies. At present, the improvement of this cooperation is obviously not what China is welcome, and China is also afraid of being surrounded by neighboring countries.

Weng Luzhong pointed out that it was China's aggressive attitude in diplomacy and military, which led to soberness and unity in various countries. "The world's response to China is not completely misunderstanding, but the attitude expressed by China is worried about the world. Not to mention the high degree of competition, the stronger the Chinese side shows, the more worrying everyone will be."

** Kishida Wenxiong: European and Indo -Pacific regions are inseparable from security **Lisa ∙ Kattis(Lisacurtis)It is believed that this shows that the security situation of Europe and Indo -Pacific is increasingly related: "Russia's invasion of Ukraine awaken European countries and realize that it is necessary to maintain a deterrent in the Indo -Pacific region."

At the same time, Japan is also worried about the joint cruise of the Chinese and Russian troops. She said: "This kind of cooperation between China and Russia prompts Japan to seek more cooperation with India -Pacific countries. This also allows us to see the connection between European security and Indo -Pacific security again. This also tells China that the close relationship with Russia is a price. of."

** South Korea strengthens cooperation with NATO military information and network security **

South Korean President Yin Xiyue said when he arrived at the summit on Tuesday that he hoped to strengthen cooperation with NATO in the field of military information and network security. He also said: "In the future, I believe that the security of cross -Atlantic and Indo -Pacific regions is an indispensable part of global security. This is why we need to work closely with partners in India -Pacific regions including South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. s reason."

NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg said: "We attach importance to your partnership, because security is not regional, but global. What happened in the Indo -Pacific region is important to Europe, and what happened in Europe is also right. The Indo -Pacific area is important. "

Yin Xiyue has been promoting South Korea and Europe and other American allies to strengthen security cooperation to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile threats and respond to tensions with China. South Korea set up a representative office in NATO last November.

During this NATO summit, Yin Xiyue held bilateral talks with many Eurasian leaders and signed a "individual targeted partnership plan" with NATO to strengthen bilateral cooperation in 11 fields such as nuclear diffusion and network security. Essence

Although the NATO Summit ’s communiqué expresses its willingness to unite and respond to China's threat, Weng Luzhong believes that at present, its symbolic significance is greater than substantial significance. "How to implement it must be followed. For example, whether NATO has to set up an office in Japan; whether these countries are willing to have a closer connection with Japan, South Korea, and even Australia and India on security issues. The power will be higher. "

Weng Luzhong predicts that Beijing will adopt consistently differentiation methods for NATO allies, Japan and South Korea and other countries in the future, so it is important to maintain unity in these countries.

Curtis also believes that there are different opinions in NATO's internal focus on the new focus of China and India. "But it can be foreseeable that China will continue to become part of NATO discussion. Considering Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as long as China and Russia continue to enhance the connection This will make people even more doubt about the purpose of China. "

# Climate change affects more than half of the world's color change color changes

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 12th) The latest research on the release pointed out that in the past 20 years, the colors of the earth's marine area have changed. The closer to the tropical areas, the color of the marine color has become greener. Researchers said this shows the impact of climate change on the world marine ecology.

![](Images/rficn/2023-07-13T-11-32-08-00-00/000000.png)Scientists said that more than half of the world's ocean detected color changes, and this scope was larger than the global land area.

The study was published in the scientific journal "Nature". Research authors believe that this is the result of changes in the ecosystem, especially small plankton. They are the center of the Marine Food Network and play a key role in stabilizing the atmosphere.

B.B.Cael, the first author of the paper and the British National Oceanography Center, told AFP: "The reason why we care about these colors is because the color reflects the state of the ecosystem, so the color changes are changed. It means changes in the ecosystem. "

Observing the color of the ocean from space can outline the situation in the upper water area.

If the ocean is dark blue, it means that there are very few creatures in the water; if the seawater is green, there may be more biological activities, especially the floating plants that can be used for photosynthesis. They contain chlorophyll like plants.

These floating plants produce a large amount of oxygen, which is an important part of the global carbon cycle and the basis of the Marine Food Network.

Although researchers said that more research is needed to find out what these colors change may mean, but climate change is likely to be the reason.

The ingrained discrimination helps to help the elderly in the illness, and eventually the patient suffers.

According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), a study report on the American Nine -State State 9 countries shows that whether it is from the absolute value or the local African -American or non -indigenous women, the pregnancy and maternal mortality rate of African -American women is "high. It's amazing. "

This study uses data from Brazil, Colombia, Costa, Cuba, Panama, Sulin, Qiaolida and the Republic of Tobago, the United States and Uruguay.

The report also pointed out that "structural racism and gender discrimination are obvious in the health differences between pregnancy and mothers, and it is true in different income levels, countries and regions."

This problem is particularly obvious in the United States. African -American women die within 6 weeks during or after childbirth, which is three times that of white women.

In Sulin in South America, the chance of dying in the process of childbirth in African -American women is 2.5 times that of white women, and Brazil and Colombia are 1.6 times.

The high mortality rate of African pregnant women in the Americas is often blamed on "individuals failed to seek timely factors such as treatment, bad lifestyle or genetic constitution." The systemic and accumulated racist hazards in the field of health.

Natalia Kanem, executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, said: "The disaster of racism still plagues African -American women in the Americas, and many of them are descendants of slavery victims."

She went on to say: "During the childbirth, African -American and girls were extremely common when they encountered improper diagnosis and treatment. Their demand was not valued, and the family was destroyed due to unnecessary death of the maternal maternal."

The responsibility of difficulties in exchanges is all in the United States who "regardless of China's concern and man -made obstacles." Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning once asked the United States to "show sincerity."

One of the obstacles to the difficulty of military dialogue between the two countries may be the US sanctions against the Chinese Minister of Defense Li Shangfu.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T02-23-13-08-00/12kundera-master1050.jpg)Milan Kundera died on Tuesday at the age of 94. The Communist Party's abandoned child captured his suffocating ridiculous life in the novel with a sharp and sexuality of his motherland Czechoslovakians in paradise, making him a world -renowned literary star.

A spokesman for Kundela's publisher in France, the Galimar Publishing House, confirmed the death of Kundela, saying that he died after "long -term illness".

A series of best -selling books in Kundela began in "Joking". This book was published during the "Prague Spring" in 1967. As a result, it was well received. A few months later, the army led by the Soviet Union crushed the Czechoslovak "humanization of humanization. Socialism "experiments, and this work in Kundera was also banned in revenge. In the year, he settled in Paris and completed the last novel, "Celebrations meaningless" (2015).

"Celebration is meaningless" is his first new novel since 2000, but with his most popular novel "The Light of Life in Unbearable Life" (once translated as "The Light in Life in Life" -The Note) Compared with, at best, the response can only be said.

"Unbearable Light" was successfully published after publishing in 1984, and has been translated as more than 20 languages for many years. In 1988, the novel was adapted into a movie, causing wider attention. Daniel Dai Lewis played one of the protagonists Thomas. Thomas is a Czech surgeon who criticizes the Communist Party's leadership and eventually wipes the windows for a living.

But for Thomas, rubbing the window is a good job. He is an out -of -the -box Playboy, always happy to meet new women, including boring housewives. However, these sex, as well as Thomas himself and the other three main characters -his wife, a charming painter and the lover of the painter, all have greater purpose.

When "New York Times Book Review" included the novel on the list of best books in 1984, "The real work of this writer is to find an image for his country's catastrophic history in his life."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T02-23-13-08-00/12Kundera-lightness-jumbo.jpg)The 1984 novel of Kundera has been translated into at least twenty languages and is reprinted multiple times.

"He uses these four protagonists relentlessly, and puts each pair of characters on the opposite side to describe a world that has been exhausted. People can't find the way to express humanity at all."

Kundela is worried that the Czech culture may be wiped out by Stalinism -just like the dishonest leader was erased from the official photos -this is the core of the "Laughing Book". The book published the English version in 1979 Essence

In 1980, John Updick wrote in the "Book Review" that the book "talented, unique, and directly invited us to enter with pure and witty brushes; however, it is also strange. "Outside the door."

In 1983, in an interview with "Paris Review", Kundela said: "My ambition of my life is to combine the most serious problems with the lightest form. The truth of the drama (including the drama that happened on our bed, the drama performed on the historical stage), and their terrible triviality. We experience the lightness of life that cannot be affordable. "

He admits that his title is easy to exchange. "Each of my novels can be named" The Light of Life in Unbearable Life "," Handle "or" Funny Love "," he said. "They reflect a small number of themes, these themes have troubled me and defined me. Unfortunately, I also limit me. Except for these themes, I have nothing to say or write."

Although "Laughing Books" and "The Light of Life Can't withstand" are written in Czech language, they are created in the bright sun in France. In 1975, Kundera no longer hoped to gain political and creative freedom in China and settled in France.

His immigration decision highlighted the choice of Czech intellectuals at that time. Thousands of people left. Drama writer Watslav Harville was one of the people who stayed against the resistance. He had served many times, one of which was nearly three years. He came over to help lead the velvet revolution that was successful in 1989, and then served as President Czechoslovakia. After Slovakia decided to be independent, he served as President of the Czech Republic.

With this great change, for the first time, the first time in Kundera's book was legalized in his motherland. But there are few people who need these books and few people sympathize with him. It is estimated that only 10,000 copies of "The Light of Unbearable Life" were sold in the country.

Many Czechs believed that Kundera abandoned his compatriots and chose a relaxed way out.

Kundela's first novel "Joy "'s bumpy history shows that he tries to promote the troubles facing the reform from the inside.

After the "Spring of Prague", the book was blamed and was considered cynical, pornography, and anti -socialism. If readers could accept the thinking of the examiner in some way, they would understand what they meant.

The main narrative of "Joy" Ludwick was a college student in Prague in the 1950s, and he was suspected of party members for personalism. "What you laughs makes people feel that you only know what you laugh," they said to him. Then, a blindly obedient girlfriend wrote a letter to him and praised the "health spirit" in the summer training class she was sent to. The young Ludwk felt that she was missing her, and she was full of joy. He was dissatisfied with this and made a terrible mistake:

"So I bought a postcard," he said. "Then (to make her feel painful, shocked, and confused):‘ Optimism is the opium of the people!The spirit of health is stupid!Long live Trotsky!’”

Then there was a trial. Because of his jokes, Ludwick was kicked out of the Communist Party and was sentenced to digging coal in a military punishment unit.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T02-23-13-08-00/oakImage-1689169322999-jumbo.jpg)Kundera's "Joking" was published in 1967, received praise, and was later banned.

Kundera did not suffer that fate, but when the Communist Party seized the regime in 1948, he was twice expelled from the party he had supported since the age of 18.

He was first expelled from the party in 1950, just because he said something irrelevant, which inspired the central plot of "Joy". However, he was allowed to continue his studies; in 1952, he graduated from the Prague Academy of Fine Arts and was subsequently appointed as a world literary lecturer in the school.Milan Kundera was born in Buluo on April 1, 1929, which is the current Czech Republic. His mother is Mirada Yenoscova, and his father is Ludvik Kundela.

Young Kundela grew up in a country occupied by the Germans from 1939 to 1945. He was one of the people who accepted communism by millions after the war.

He said that when he realized that the bad things in the name of socialism were not betrayal of the revolution, but when the revolution was inherent from the beginning, it was too late.

At the end of Communism in 1989, Kundera had lived in France with his wife Verah Helagova for 14 years. At first he was a teacher at the University of Renne and later went to Paris. Czechoslovakia canceled his citizenship in 1979, and two years later, he became French citizen. The Czech Republic restored his motherland in 2019. The information about his survivors has not been announced.

French and Czech -borne writers Milan Kundela, who are world -renowned in "Unbearable in Life", died in Paris on the afternoon of July 11 at the age of 94. Milan Kundera is an exile writer. He perfectly mastered the "art of novels". He is also a poet, playwright and proseist. In addition to "Unbearable Light in Life", his high -profile works also include "Living elsewhere", "Jungs", "Laughing", "Slow", "identity", "ignorance", "Immortal" and so on Essence

**1**

Milan Kundera was born on April 1, 1929 in a middle -class family in Czechoslovarblino. His father was a pianist. Affected by his father, Kundela learned music since he was a child, and later turned to writing. In the 1960s, he experienced slow and painful disillusionment like his peers. Stalinism and extreme paranoia gradually crushed the vitality of the country. After many years, Kundela described "with infinitely with infinite humor with infinite ones. pessimistic".

Kundera was a member of the Communist Party of Czechospower. He was expelled from the party in 1950. This incident inspired him to create the first novel, "Jacquet". In this novel, a young handsome and smart boy wrote a postcard to a female classmate, which wrote: "Optimism is the opium of the people!The healthy atmosphere is full of stupid odors!Long live Trotsky!"The boy was a party member, and as a result, he was expelled from the party. In 1952, Kundera became a lecturer in World Literature in Prague Film Academy. With the publication of a series of poetry and drama, his literary reputation continues to improve, including the praise of the communist hero Urilus Vacci, published in 1955(Julius Fucik)The Poetry Collection "Last May"(May)Essence However, Kundela later excluded his early works, saying that he "tried many different directions -looking for my voice, my style and myself." It wasn't until the birth of the novel "Me, Sad God" that he understood the style he wanted to pursue. "I, Sad God" is a distorted version of "Love Saint Sanchano", showing the characteristics of the bitter music of Kundera's later works.

In 1956, Kundera was once again accepted by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. In 1970, he was fired again. In 1975, Kunderla exiled to France. In 1979, after the Czechoslovak's socialist republic published the novel "Laughs and Forgotten Records" in Kundela, he recovered his nationality. In 1981, Kundera became French citizens.

It was during the exile that Kundera's talent was blooming. He created a series of wonderful and mysterious novels. These novels are unique and are also related to James James and Franz Kaff. The work of the card is inherent. In 1984, the publishing of "Unbearable in Life" confirmed the status of the literary superstar in Kundera. This novel is based on the Brages of 1968 as the background, telling the struggle between two couples with politics and infidelity, and discussed the contradiction between freedom and responsibility.

"Immortal" is the last novel created by Czech -language, and his first novel with France as a background. This novel is full of philosophy and published in 1988. After that, Kunderla wrote three short stories "Slow", "identity" and "ignorance" in French. These works are filled with nostalgia and explore the possibility of going home.

Kundela's work is deeply provoked. American novelist Olgacarlisle commented on Kundela: "He used universal attractive insights that Western readers noticed Eastern Europe. He called for truth and inner freedom, and he could not recognize the truth without such freedom. He realized that in the process of seeking truth, we must be prepared to face death. These themes have made him praise. " Irish novelist Johnbanville pointed out: "Kundera's novels are as practical as they first published." British novelist Ianmcewan commented on Kundera's "Laughs and Forgotten Records": "People not only feel the profound fun of novel creation, but also amazed by inspiring the pain of their creation." "Sunday Times" said that "ignorance" is "the best novel created by the best novelist in the world."

Kundedra was published at the age of 85 and published the novel "Celebrations Neckless". This novel was a "ending" of Kundera's career to some extent. After the emergence of the work, it caused the differences in literary critics. Some critics praised them for its simplicity and elegance and humor, while others believed that the work marked the end of the writer's "a series of small cleverness".

Kundera has won the Jerusalem Awards, which awarded works that explore human freedom. He also won the Austrian National European Literature Award, the Held Literature Award, the Czech National Literature Award, and the Czech Franz Kafka Literature Award. Kundera has been nominated by the Nobel Prize in Literature many times, but has never won the award.

For a long time in exile in foreign countries, Kundela has never complained about his destiny. He said in an interview: "I don't have a dream of return ... I took my Prague; I took away Prague's smell, taste, language, scenery and culture." In 2019, 44 years after exile, Kundera re -obtained Czech citizenship.

**2**

Why is Kundela's work charm? Not only because of its politics. Kundela's works have a witty experimental style, rebellion, unparalleled irony and philosophical reflection, that is, Kundela has mastered the "art of novels", and his work has strong aesthetic value.

Italian literary critic AlessandropiPiPiperno pointed out that Kundera "is difficult to fall in love with a view. This makes Kundela a surprisingly outdated writer. Today, everyone has themselves to anything. The point of view ... Kundera is cautious about a strong point of view. I guess that this stems from his struggle against totalitarianism. This is a true obsession that restricts all his creations. "

Another Italian critic Emilio Fabiotorsello pointed out that Kundera's works are full of small themes. "Everything is no longer important: gestures, language, lies, jokes, missing, lost love, death. For Kundera, everything is insignificant: I personally, the life of the ordinary but unimportant characters in his writing; but the same The insignificant is a big person like Stalin and Khrushchev. Kundela made people realize that they were as light as hairy, and suddenly someone noticed that they dropped from the high ceiling of the ballroom. This is a crowded Scenes -crowded people cannot leave traces in daily life or history. "Some writers are "born" and they start writing when they are very young; some writers are inspired by society. Their creation is reactions to society. Their creative inspiration comes from dissatisfaction and indignation of society. Essence

When Jordan Elgrabuli asked what kind of writer Kundera was, Kundela said that he must not belong to the second type of writer, although he seemed to be a person who started writing to protest something. "I belong to the first type of writer, but not exactly. I mean, for me, this art temptation was very scattered at first. I painted it for a while. Then I taught movies and literature for a while. I explored in art and tried to find my own position. Finally, at the age of 30, I began to concentrate on writing prose. Just then, at that time, at that time, I think I found myself. As far as the necessity of responding to society, this is not my impulse, nor is it the urge to choose literature. Let me say: This is not a writing to oppose or protest The problem is that the objective reality I saw was so fascinating and mysterious, so that I was suddenly attracted by prose, and I left everything behind. However, even when I started writing prose, , I still continue to create with my early aesthetic ambitions. "

** 3 **

Among the many works, "Unbearable Light in Life" is a representative work of Kundela. This novel has been widely read and has become part of the world's classic literary works. In this work, Kundela said: "This novel is not the author's confession, but a survey of human life in the world that is becoming a trap."

When French writer Christiansalmon asked Kundera how to understand the "trap" here, Kunderla explained: "We have always knew that life is a trap. We were born without requirements and were locked and were locked. In a body that we have never chosen, it is destined to die. On the other hand, the vast one once provided the possibility for constant escape. A soldier can escape the army and start another life in the neighbor. Sudden Century, the world is closing to us. The decisive incident of the world's traps is undoubtedly a war in 1914, known as (the first time in history) World War. Europe, and it is not the whole of Europe. But the adjective of the "World" expresses fear more, because since then, everything on the earth will no longer be just local issues, all disasters involve the entire world. Therefore, we, we, we The fate is more and more determined by the situation that no one can escape, and these factors make us more and more similar. "

Some people classify "Unbearable in Life" into the category of psychological novels, and Kundela does not recognize such a classification. He said: "My novels are not psychological novels. More precisely, they are not aesthetic categories that are usually called psychological novels. Let us speak more accurate: All novels in each era pay attention to the mystery of themselves. As long as You create an imagination existence, a character, you will naturally ask such a problem: What is yourself? How can you grasp yourself? This is one of the basic issues based on this novel. If you want, Through different answers to this question, you can distinguish the different tendencies in the history of novels, even different times. The first batch of European storytelles do not even know this psychological method. Things. Despite this, behind these interesting stories, we can still see a certain belief: through action, people can get out of the daily universe of everyone; through action, people can distinguish themselves from others and become individuals. But Ding also said: 'In any behavior, the first intention of the perpetrator is to reveal their image.' Therefore, from the beginning, the action is regarded as the self -portrait of the actor ... the contradiction of action is the novel of the novel. One of the great discoveries. But if ourselves cannot be grasped by action, where do we and how do we grasp it? Therefore, in the process of pursuing ourselves, we are forced to give up the visible action world, and instead look at the invisible inner heart Life."

Kundela believes that there is no inner monologue in "Unbearable in Life". He said: "Joyce sets a microphone in Bloom's head. Thank you in the heart, and we have more understanding of ourselves. However, I can't use that microphone myself."

Those who are familiar with Chinese history, know that Zhao Kuangyin Chen Qiaobing has changed its "cup of wine to release the military power", and also knows that Deng Xiaoping's "14th National Congress" of the Communist Party of China "Zhang Paper to release the military power", now witnessed Russian President Putin's "telephone release of military power".

On June 27, Moscow time (the same below), Belarusian President Lukashenko met with the head of the strong department, revealing that Perigo's more details were calmed down. Although there was no public content, the amount of information was sufficient. It's really a great person, not only helping Putin, but also satisfying the curiosity of the world.

** Lukashenko: Sober and decisive practice low -key **

** 1. Putin calls at 10:10 on June 24. ** He made a television speech nationwide at 10 o'clock, qualitatively Perigo was the "armed rebellion". According to the "Russian Channel" TV station "Moscow Kremlin Putin" report, Putin's speech was recorded rather than live broadcast, and it began recording at 9:55. Observing the desk behind Putin's speech video, the recording location was his daily office, showing that after the recording of the TV speech, the technical team quickly called Lukashenko as soon as he exited the office. Of course, it is not completely talked about and notified, including the needs of urgent help, but it is not possible to let go of the face of the president of the great country and the "leading brother". Putin is very accurate to find a middleman. After the Belarusian election in August 2020, the storm was up riots. To put it bluntly, acquaintances are good. In the crisis, the true feelings, the two became brothers for changing their lives.

** 2. "Putin has made a cruel decision." ** Lukashenko has always felt Putin's contradiction mentality keenly. On the one hand, it has been determined to suppress it at the expense when necessary, and on the other hand, he is worried about the outbreak of the civil war. The core subtext of his national television speech is to clearly select the Minister of Defense of the National Defense and Chief of Staff Glasimov, which will not only meet the requirements of Porigen's appointment of the two, but also instructed the two to lead the armed forces to suppress Pu Pu Pu Pu Pu Pu Pu Pu. The soldiers launched by Ligo.

** 3. Deputy Minister of the Russian Ministry of Defense Evkolov and the Federal Security Bureau Director Boltnikov attended the negotiations. ** So far, many mainstream media in the world have ignored this very valuable information. This shows that Lukashenko is the leader of both sides and proposes a compromise compromise plan. It is a participant in negotiating, but it is not the only person and not a decision maker. Putin responded positively, not only authorized Lukashenko to call for contact with Porigo, but also authorized the heads of the Ministry of Defense and the Federal Security Bureau to directly participate in the negotiations on behalf of him. Lukashenko confirmed: No one else other than these two people participated in the talks; Yev Kurov "played an important role in the organization of the talks", Lukashenko's phone was called first, and then handed it to Pu to Pu Pu. Ligor Renfu answered in his hands; the negotiation was finally called Boltnikov to reach an agreement by Porigor. The agreement reached in this way is to be implemented (for example, Pryigon is worried about the attacker when the Wagner soldiers retreat, and Boltnikov promises to attack "will not happen"). of.

** 4. Pricigen is in a "semi -crazy" state. ** Lukashenko's description is very accurate and objective. Bachmut's "grinding meat war" for half a year, Russia killed his eyes and died for a lifetime, and his psychology was completely distorted. He had just been collected, cut, and withdrew his military rights. Of course, he was hostile to the Russian Ministry of Defense. Lukashenko is a human essence, and cleverly takes the responsibility for Porigen to shirk the mutiny, saying that the commanders of the Wagner are "very angry" and "greatly affected Perigen himself." Official influence and incitement, seeing too much death on the battlefield. In fact, the biggest interest of the withdrawal of military rights is Perigo Ren, and he is the first responsible person in the mutiny.

** 5. Lupu's first phone call "Scolding for half an hour". ** Lukashenko described, "We talked for 30 minutes with swear words, and the amount of swear words was 10 times more than normal." Porigo "apologized" to Lukashenko, and judged from Lukashenko's response to apologize for the mutiny, not to apologize for swear words. There is a stomach and anger in Porigen. You need to vent to those familiar and trust. You need to greet Shoshigo and Gracorph with swear words. This is normal, men, and wild. The state of the meat war. Lukashenko also scolded swear words, and at the same time, he stated that "I can understand" as a soothing and adapt to a specific, sensitive and emotional interactive atmosphere in order to talk.

** 6. The second or third call Lukashenko "I have seen that he (Pleigo Ren) is ready to give up." ** The key judgment of Lukashenko will definitely give feedback to Putin as soon as possible. On June 24th, he and Porigen had a total of 7 calls. Obviously, the subsequent 4-5 calls followed only how to accept the specific negotiations, how to arrange the commander and participants of the commander and participants. Porigon "swear" to Lukashenko, and the bleeding incident of killing civilians "will not happen", indicating that it is not completely crazy. His contradictions are concentrated on the Russian Ministry of Defense, not the motherland and the people.

** 7. Pryigo has denied any Russian soldiers on the way from the Rougusk wild camping to Rostov on the Rosteov on the Don River. ** Lukashenko only mentioned this sentence to avoid whether Purigo was acknowledged to kill the Russian soldiers on the way to Moscow, that is, shot down the Russian helicopter, which essentially faded Pritigen's crime of mutiny. On the way to Moscow, Porigo acknowledged that he had shot down the military helicopter. Russian and Western media reported that the Wagner Group shot down three or even 6 Russian helicopters. When Putin met with Ping rebellion on June 27, he proposed to silently sorrow to the sacrifice pilot for 1 minute, but the specific number and death soldiers were still a mystery.

** 8. Putin reported "Strangely, the situation is better than ever at the front". ** It shows that the counterattack progress began on June 4th, which was better than Putin's expectations, which means that the probability of "anti -counterattack" of the Russian organization "anti -counterattack" increased. Ukraine President Zelei has shirge the responsibility of uncomfortable counterattacks. On July 6, it claimed that NATO national aid weapons were too slow, so the Russian army had enough time to have enough time to Brace and defense, and did not provide F-16 fighters and long-range missiles. The author has been analyzed. Even if NATO provides fighters and long -range missiles, it cannot change the war. Instead, it is easy to upgrade to direct military conflict in the United States and Russia.

** 9. Russia "is our (common) motherland." ** Lukashenko does not clearly define a cultural, or psychological, or political "motherland", and it is more likely to have both. At least it shows that after the riots in the 2020 election, he fully accepted the integration of Russia and white, and the two countries were at least the Confederation. On the phone, he did not conceal his position to Porigen, and he had already mobilized a brigade. If Wagner soldiers entered Moscow or had civilian bleeding, the brigade would defend Moscow. Once the subtext is the war, he firmly participates in the war and chose Putin. After calm, Pricigo knew that he had no retreat, and he must be defeated by cruel suppression.** 11. "If Russia collapses, we will be buried under the ruins, and we will die." ** This is a very sober and concise logic. It understands it. It can also understand why China and other BRICS countries maintain neutrality in the Russian and Ukraine War. Essence The global head of state is about 200. Like the provincial college entrance examination champion, after entering Tsinghua University of Peking University, he can soon be divided into three, six or nine. Some of the heads of state are mediocre, virtual, or virtue, or unsatisfactory, or virtue without all. Some small nations have strong ability, and the influence on the surrounding and worlds is far beyond national strength. For example, two Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Li Xianlong's father and son; North Korea Kim Jong Un is smart and capable, but unfortunately the national strength is too weak to play in China and the United States; Lukashenko is the latest one. In the past, I was running a dragon in international occasions, and there was no chance to show their fists.

** 12. "Belarus will help Wagner for a while." ** Lukashenko said that the commander of Wagner has trained the Belarusian army with practical experience and skills. According to Polish intelligence, about 8,000 Wagner soldiers settled in Belarus and worried about Poland's security and had added troops on the Baibai border. The numbers should be exaggerated. Please be easy to send God. In fact, the Wagner Group stays, and Belarus is more dangerous.

The first hidden danger was all Belarusi president after threatening Lukashenko. The total number of Belarusian troops is about 80,000. Wagner Group expands to about 40,000 as expected in its territory. The combat power tactics are even more fierce, and sooner or later become the country of middle school. Lukashenko and Putin and Pleigo are more than 20 years old friends. There is no crisis of survival, but if he wants his younger son to be President Taiping and Belarus Taiping 20 years later, it will be as soon as possible after the signing of the Russian and Ukraine Agreement Agreement. Send Perigon and all soldiers with Wagner Group out of the country. Lukashenko is very old and has not been tied forever with Russia. The younger son Nicholas to Peking University instead of studying at the University of Moscow is evidence. Whether it is to safeguard family interests or national interests, China is going up, and Russia is going down, it is common sense.

The second hidden danger is to control the self -reliance after controlling the tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus. If the Wagner Group in the future will engage in a coup in Belarus or support the agent to be the president, once the tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus are seized, the United States and Russia are unbeaten, as the Russian war in Ukraine is now in Ukraine. Therefore, after the signing of the Russian and Ukraine Agreement Agreement, Belarus's strategic pressure on NATO was alleviated. The Russian tactical nuclear weapons should be evacuated. It signed a common defense military treaty with Russia. The nuclear protection umbrella was safe enough. The United States and NATO did not dare to act lightly.

** Soldiers calm down: I don’t want to fight without anti -anti -Putin **

** 1. The two sides did not tear their faces. ** Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng launched the Xi'an Incident. "Soldiers" Chiang Kai -shek anti -Japanese, still supported Chiang as the highest commander. Porigen launched a similar "soldiers", and he was as loyal to the highest commander. He just wanted to force Pujing to withdraw the Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff. He thought he was more loyal to Putin than these two "grass bags". This is obviously not a coup, and it is unintentional to overthrow Putin. Putin did not name Prigo in the national TV speech, leaving room for reconciliation.

** 2. Pricigo did not openly anti -Putin. ** After Putin delivered a TV speech at 10 o'clock on June 24, Pricigen responded through audio. Putin called him a traitor "is a big mistake", "No one will surrender at the request of the president", "We don't want to want to do it This country continues to live in corruption and lies. " Some media interpretations are the first public anti -Putin for Pleigo. The author didn't take it for granted. Pricigen went on to say, "We are patriots." The intention is more to justify his own behavior. It is described by a political terms familiar to the Chinese people, which is "Qingjun side", which is good for Putin.

According to official statistics from China, about 1,200 branches "closed the door". In addition, a questionnaire survey by the People's Bank of China showed that the overall loan demand index fell 16.2 percentage points from the previous season. Analysts believe that the main reason behind this is that China's economy has continued to decline and financing demand has decreased.

The report quoted the saying in the industry, "In recent years, as major banks have pushed online banking and APPs, some outlets are closed and transferred to it." Earlier, there were media statistics that in 2022, about 2,400 various banks outlets were closed.

Chinese financial scholar He Jiangbing pointed out that Alipay and WeChat payment began to use it more than ten years ago, which is not the fundamental reason. First of all, bank profitability decreases, reduction of people with shrinking outlets can also reduce expenditure. The root cause is that the economy continues to decline.

"Mainland China is mainly based on indirect financing, that is, financing through bank agencies. All economies in the country depend on bank financing. The overall economy will also lead to the decline in the profit value of banks. , Simply withdrew the outlets. In this context, it speeds up. "He Jiangbing said.

According to the results of the National Bank of China Council ’s questionnaires, the overall loan demand index was 62.2%, a decrease of 16.2 percentage points from the previous quarter.

** The difficulty of the Chinese economy is increasingly increasing **

Mr. Tian in Wuhan told this station that the so -called "desperately saving money and dare not spend money" has the premise that there must be money. Affected by the environment, it is difficult to operate in small business, and it can only be maintained. The days of ordinary people are becoming more and more sad, and "the old people" appeared in the house of relatives and friends around him. "They are at home, playing the computer every day, and do nothing. I have seen a child in this area. It is almost 30 years old. His father died at home and didn't know when he died."

Mr. Tian recalled that he was also the security of the community 3 years ago. Some residents did not see anyone for 15 days. The leaders arranged for him to go upstairs to check. Old youths can continue to sleep at home. The epidemic has passed, and he said that the life around him has not improved much.

** "Big Water Manflies" stimulates the economy.

The downward pressure on the Chinese economy is not small. Many financial media have discussed that the Chinese travel is in March of this year and the first reduction in the year. After the release of about RMB 600 billion, when is the next reduction?

The Chinese President Yi Gang recently published the article "The Autonomous, Effectiveness, Effectiveness and Economic Stability of Monetary Policy" in the “Economic Research" of the Institute of Economic Research of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, emphasizing that insisting on not engaged in "big water" Currency ... In the future, China's potential economic growth is expected to remain in a reasonable range, and conditions are as good as possible to maintain normal monetary policy.

However, in May this year, the Chinese Traveling issued the "China Monetary Policy Implementation Report in the first quarter of 2023" but deleted "not engaged in large water".

"Now it should be injected in finance, not in the monetary policy. No matter how water policy is put in water policy, it is not just a liquidity trap, but a liquidity black hole. No matter how much water is cast, it is useless. How can there be a hole in a hole? "He Jiangbing said.

"Time does not wait for people, there is a golden window period in the economic recovery. Once you miss it, you may pay greater policy costs." Zhao Jian, the founding dean of the Xijing Research Institute, recently pointed out that because the modern economy is irreversible to a certain extent, it is irreversible to a certain extent. The bankruptcy company cannot start to die, and those who have been unemployed for too long cannot return to the workplace immediately. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the economy in a reasonable growth rate. "Create a loose, free, and happy economic and social environment for recovery, and stimulate the endogenous creativity and spending power of the public." Zhao Jian said that other policies are likely to be cure for the standard.

### Hong Kong immigration tide superimposed to retreat school struggling parents and schools in the "cold winter"

After the 2019 "Removal Central" movement, Hong Kong continued to appear in Hong Kong

** The summer vacation is approaching, and Hong Kong has entered the peak immigration season. **

Single mother DODO grasped the last two weeks to pack up. At the end of the month, he would bring his 15 -year -old son to immigrate to the UK and let him advance to high school in London.

"After preparing for almost two years, I finally went to the way, and I was relieved before the son's rise." She said to BBC in Chinese.

This is much earlier than the original plan. She originally planned to send him to overseas university after graduating from her son's middle school, but the "Counterfeit" movement and the National Security Law landed in Hong Kong to change everything. "I used to let him broaden his horizons, and never thought about politics at all. Now the situation is forcing me to take him away as soon as possible."

DODO engaged in the event planning was a reporter in foreign media and is quite sensitive to political risks. She said that her immigration "dead line" was before her son's high school, because the Education Bureau announced in 2021 that the "Citizen and Social Development Division (Commission)" replaced the "General Education Department". At least once in mainland China during the fourth and sixth years of China.

"I was forced to exchange by the government to the mainland, but will the students enter and exit the mainland will be detained? My son has criticized the government on social media, will it happen on the mainland? Although it is only a two -day and one night trip, I am very worried about his personal life. Freedom and security. "

Another immigrant Hong Kong mother Mandy, considers the competitiveness of children under the "new era".

"Foreign capital has been withdrawn or reduced scale, and Hong Kong can be comprehensively sinicized after ten years. More and more state -owned enterprises will become places dominated by Mandarin and mainlanders. But my son has always been in English schools. There is no advantage in development in Hong Kong. "

She is engaged in marketing, her husband works in the banking industry. Last week, he took his 9 -year -old and 11 -year -old son to move his house to Bridbane, Australia. "Relative to the peak period, there are fewer people walking this summer, but there are not much less. In my circle, everyone is silently performing the immigration plan."

Since Beijing issued the National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2020, hundreds of thousands have left the city. The BBC "Ourworld" continued to track several Hong Kong people who stayed and moved to overseas to record how the changes in political and social atmosphere affected their lives.

Among them, 27,000 people were lost from September 2021 to September 2022.

In contrast, from September 2018 to September 2019 before the anti -repair campaign, the number of primary and secondary school students was reduced by 2,429. In other words, the number of losses increased by more than 10 times in 3 years, and the loss rate also expanded from 0.35%to 3.99%.

The tide of withdrawals has also spread to kindergarten. As of the past year of September 2022, at least 6,500 kindergarten students will no longer be promoted in Hong Kong. (K2) Steel (K3) dropped out, and the loss rate was as high as 9.69%.

In response, the Education Bureau responded that parents have always had the right to choose to study for their children. Students' flow, including transfer, move to the Mainland, and overseas education, is also "normal."

### Which schools are the most affected?

Some people in the educational community said that the direct -funded schools, which are popular with middle -class families, are most affected by the most affected tide of dropping out of school

An English middle school principal, an unknown English middle school, pointed out to the BBC that the government was unwilling to recognize the number of immigration tide caused the number of students to decrease sharply. "Data can speak. If it is only naturally flowing and the normal state, why is there no such obvious loss rate before 2019?"

The principal said that about 800 students of the school have been lower than 4%, but after 2019, it has increased to high single digits and even two -digit number.

"Most of the previously dropped out of school was high school students in the fourth and middle schools. They went to study in foreign countries, but in the past two or three years, there were more junior high schools. Almost all of them were immigrants and went to Britain, Canada or Australia."

After the Hong Kong National Security Law takes effect, every April 15th, follow the mainland to host the "National National Security Day" event

Mandy, a Hong Kong mother who lives in Australia, has previously attended Direct English Primary School in two sons. One of them is a shower elementary school in traditional famous universities. She said that she struggled for a long time before immigration. "For so many years, I have spent time and resources to send them to the school. I hope they will win the starting line.

However, she still made her heart, and she believed that the "Sinicization" of Direct Schools was not serious, but it is estimated that she would "escape" in two or three years. "I don't oppose national education. The problem is the intensity and content of execution. Now it is forcibly instilling and controlling ideas. In the long run, it will limit children's vision, creativity and expression ability."

At the end of the month, DODO, who immigrated to the UK, also said that after the National Security Law took effect, he saw his son's textbook revision. The duties of being dismissed even referred to Hong Kong's "colonies" in the UK.

"Even my son asked me, why can you even change the historical facts? Is there any" Sino -British Joint Statement "? When education becomes brainwashing, you will ask yourself, do you want to shake the red flag and wear a red scarf in the future? I have to take him away. "

Hong Kong Kindergarten has also been impacted by the tide of withdrawal, and there have been closure waves.

In addition to the traditional middle -class campus, grass -roots campuses are also affected by dropping school.

The pseudonym Ms. Lin's kindergarten principal manages a school located in Tianshui Wai District, New Territories. She said that the school has nearly 420 studies, and in 2021, there are insufficient students, and only about 370 people remain.

"For 30 years, we have always been full of life. We have never heard of retreating for immigration, but suddenly a dozen people in the past two or three years, almost all of them are immigrants." She said to BBC in Chinese.

She said that many withdrawal immigrants are families in the district, but there are also many public housing families with grassroots roots, and many of them are visa to Britain with a BNO visa. "Most people dropped out of school halfway and walked very anxiously. When they got a batch of visas, some parents even left Hong Kong to send a letter to drop out of school."

A month ago, Xiaoyi, who had immigrated to the UK a month ago, was to let the 3 -year -old child drop out of school halfway. She said that her son was studying in Kindergarten Children's Class (K1) in the New Territories, and the staff of the School Affairs Office when he applied for dropping out. "He helped me handle the files mechanically, and did not ask the reason for dropping out. I feel that they have been accustomed to the tide of immigration."

She said that she was political cold and was not considered to be sent to China Movement and National Security Law, but she and her husband both engaged in the service industry, namely beauty consultants and hairdressers. The government's governance was annoyed. In March last year, he was determined to immigrate and set off for more than a year.

"Coincidentally, the threshold for immigrants in the UK, take the opportunity to take it. In addition, the Hong Kong education system will definitely strengthen Mandarin education in the future. It may sacrifice English hours, but always English is the international language. Going to foreign countries will be better for the development of the son. , His world will be bigger. "

After 2019, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people immigrants, the Hong Kong government also acknowledged the talent gap.

The Hong Kong Education Bureau responded to local media inquiries that according to the number of population figures, it is expected that the continuous decline in the school -age population in the future is not transitional but structural.

When the Chief Executive Li Jiachao responded to the tide of retirement, he said that the population of Hong Kong's population was generally generally. It is believed that "the worst situation has passed". Even if there is a loss, the number is "not so big before." He also said that the government was trying to encourage fertility to make "richer population."

However, the Ming Pao quoted Lin Cuiling, vice chairman of the Education Federation, said that the situation of immigrants from kindergarten immigrants will continue in the next few years. Even if the decline is narrowed, it is not optimistic about the overall source of students. More than 10 kindergartens in Hong Kong will be suspended in the summer vacation.

President Lin, who operated kindergartens in the Kindergarten in Tianshui, revealed that there are schools in the industry for 20 % off and 10 % off from teachers, while her schools have reduced their costs on hardware.

"In the past, buying toys and textbooks was very boldly available for children. Now we have to take care of it, or buy raw materials and come back to self -made. The school door locks. In the past, please ask the master to repair without saying a word. Some exterior walls collide and break. If it is purely affecting the appearance and no danger, it will be simply not done. "

Under the tide of dropping out, many schools face huge financial pressure

The principal of the English Middle School, who is unwilling to name, described the BBC in Chinese that withdrawal of drop -out tide to direct capital, the annual tuition income was sharply reduced, and the government's funding provided by the student's head also decreased immediately.He said that from the perspective of the school's figures, this year's withdrawal rate was reduced from the double -digit number of the previous two years to the number of high units.

"The tide of immigration is related to the political environment. If the political rotation is stable, we are indeed over the peak and the future is more optimistic, but if the political environment becomes worse and the West has increased its efforts to absorb Hong Kong people, it is difficult ","

Recently, the Hong Kong Government previewed Article 23 of the Basic Law to further increase the crimes of national security. In terms of education, through the "Patriotic Education Law", the implementation target for the first time covers the "Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots". The Hong Kong -made member members have successively advocated "de -English" or asked students to go to the Greater Bay Area in the mainland cities for half a year.

On the other side, the Canadian government has revised the "lifeboat plan" of Hong Kong immigrants. From August 15th this year, the academic qualifications of "StreamB" will be canceled. As long as you work in the local area for one year, you can apply for permanent residence. Some commented that the policy is more loose than Britain's conditions, or it may arouse a new round of immigration.

The above -mentioned principals of English middle schools who do not want to be named admitted that these of them sweated in the education community. "Every time Western countries relax immigration conditions, they shake Hong Kong society and education. I don't know how many schools can survive this cold winter."

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T06-03-26-08-00/16mag-chips-master1050.jpg)In October last year, the Bureau of Industry andSecurity (BIS) released a document equivalent to a declaration of war on the economic war against China. This 139 -page document is full of tedious bureaucratic terms and detailed technologies. detail. Such a heavyweight action becomes more eye -catching because its source is relatively unknown. The size of BIS is one of the 13 bureaus of the US Department of Commerce. It is also the smallest federal department: the budget of 2022 is slightly higher than 140 million US dollars, which is about one -eighth of a Patriot air defense missile. The bureau hired about 350 agents and officials, and they jointly monitoring trillions of dollars in transactions in various parts of the world.

During the most intense period of the Cold War, the export control of the Soviet camp was the strictest. As an important hub for Western defense, BIS handled up to 100,000 export licenses each year. During the relatively peaceful and stable period of the 1990s, BIS lost some reasons for existence, and also lost some personnel and funds. The number of licenses was reduced to about 10,000 per year. Today, this number has reached 40,000, and it is still increasing. BIS is more busy than ever, it has a huge blacklist of trade -that is, the entity list (currently 662 pages, and it is still increasing), many previously existed multilateral export control agreements, and continuing to Russia and China in China and China action. "We spend 100%of the sanctions against Russia, the other 100%time is spent in China, and 100%of the time is spent on other things." Borman said.

In recent years, semiconductor chips have become the core of BIS work. The chip is the lifeblood of the modern economy, and it is also the brain of all electronic devices and systems from iPhone to vomiting drivers, from data centers to credit cards. A new car may have more than 1,000 chips, each chip manages different aspects of vehicle operations. Semiconductor is also [quantum calculation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/science/ibm-quantum-computing.html)And artificial intelligence, etc. It is expected to completely change the driving force behind life in the next century. For example, it is reported that [Openai's training for ChatGPT is performed on 10,000 currently the most advanced chip](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/sensors/chatgpt-runs-10k-nvidia-training-gpus-potential-thousands-more)Essence

The U.S. government announced its intention through export control on October 7th [the ability to weaken Chinese production or even purchase the highest -end chip](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20221008/biden-chip-technology/)Essence The logic of this measure is very simple: advanced chips and its drive supercomputers and artificial intelligence systems can be used to produce new weapons and monitoring equipment. However, it has a wide range of influence and great significance. [The goal is far limited to many security countries in China](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-strategy-waging-microchip-tech-war)Essence "The key here is to understand the artificial intelligence industry that the United States wants to influence China," said Gregory C. Allen, director of the Washington Strategy and International Research Center Wadvani Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Center. "Semiconductor is a means to achieve this goal."

Although the control measures on October 7 are implemented in the low -key form of updating the export rules, it is essentially to eradicate China's entire advanced technology ecosystem. "The new policy reflected on October 7 is that we will not only allow China to make any technological progress, but we will also actively reverse their current technical level," Allen said. Evercoreisi's senior semiconductor analyst C. J. Musk said: "If you told me these rules five years ago, I will tell you that this is a war act -we must be in a state of war."

If these control measures are successful, it may affect the progress of the Chinese generation; if it fails, it may produce amazing adaptable results, and the future that the United States is trying to avoid the future will happen faster. This result may affect the future of Sino -US competition and the future of global order. "Since 2022, there will be two dates that will be remembered by history," Ellen said. "The first is February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine; the second is October 7."

** Although the design of semiconductors is very complicated, it is also very simple in a sense: a large number of circuits are carved on tiny silicon wafers. The switch called the transistor controls the circuit. When the circuit is turned on, it is 1; 0 when the circuit is disconnected. The first batch of chips was invented at the end of the 1950s and contained only a small amount of transistors. Today, the main semiconductor in new smartphones has 100 to 20 billion transistors. Each transistor is only virus size, and is carved in the silicon structure like layer cakes.

The famous Moore's Law describes the speed of progress over the past 60 years, and the law pointed out that the number of transistor on the chip has doubled by about every two years. "Chip war"(ChipWar)Chris Miller, the author of the book, the author of Tavz University Fleche College, often pointed out that if the aircraft's improvement speed is the same as the chip, their current flight speed will be several times the speed of light. There is no technology in the history of human civilization that is comparable to the amazing improvement of computing power.

The semiconductor manufacturing plant -wafer factories -are the most expensive factories in the world, which are the most complicated manufacturing ever. Its production scale cannot be achieved by any other equipment. At the same time, a wider range of chip industry is an interdependent network. The highly professional region and companies are all over the world. The extremely long and complex supply chain realizes the possibility of this feat. In other words, this is the world. Products. "It is difficult to imagine that if there is no most smart person in the world to work together, how can they achieve this ability?" The impact of such regulations.advertise

The latest version of the machine can make a structure as small as 10 nanometers; in contrast, the diameter of human red blood cells is about 7,000 nanometers. It uses a laser to generate a plasma 40 times higher than the surface of the solar surface, which makes a very ultraviolet light that is invisible to see it. It is refracted to the silicon chip through a series of reflectors. The laser comes from a German company, with a total of 45,7329 components; a complete EUV photoresist with more than 100,000 components with similar complexity.

EUV is only part of the entire process: a cutting -edge wafer fab may include more than 500 machines and 1,000 steps. However, EUV alone is almost a miraculous human achievement, and it can work with unimaginable scale and accuracy. "I really believe that our machine is the most complicated thing made by human beings," said Ben Shaop, the current vice president of Asmore's technology. Today, after Twinscan's first trial operation for more than ten years, no other company can reproduce Astai's achievements.

By squeezing the natural bottleneck of the industry, the goal of Biden's government is to prevent China from entering the future of chip technology. Its influence will far exceed China's military progress, and will also threaten China's economic growth and scientific leadership. "We said that China should not make progress in some key technical areas," said Emily Kilkres, a senior researcher at the New American Security Center and former US trading official. "These areas are exactly the driving force for future economic growth and development." Today, scientific progress is usually achieved by simulation and analysis of large amounts of data, not through repeated tests. Simulation is used to discover the future of new life -saving drugs, the future of simulated climate change, the behavior of exploring galaxies, and the physics of the hypersonic missile and nuclear explosion.

Jack Tanggara, the founding director of the University of Tennessee's Innovation Computing Laboratory, told me: "People with the best supercomputers can engage in the best scientific research." Tangkara runs a [TOP500] named [TOP500](https://www.top500.org/)Projects, the fastest supercomputers in the world every two years. As of June this year, China has 134 seats and the United States has 150. But this does not reflect the full picture: Around 2020, the number of computers submitted in China has fallen sharply, which is to be hoped to avoid unnecessary attention from Tang Gara. Rumors about the new super computer leaked in the scientific papers and research announcements, causing observer to speculate the real state of competition -and the size of China's leading advantage. "This is amazing, because China's computers have not been on the list in 2001," Tang Gara said. "Now they have grown to the point where they dominate."

However, behind China is a key weakness: almost all chips that provide motivation for China's most advanced projects and institutions are inseparable from American technology. "The entire industry can only operate only when the United States is involved," Miller said. "In every facilities close to cutting -edge technology, there are American tools, American design software, and American intellectual property rights." Although the Chinese government has been working hard for decades and invested in "independent innovation" It has tens of billions of dollars, but this problem is still serious. In 2020, Chinese domestic chip manufacturers only provided 15.9%of the country's total demand. Just in April this year, the cost of imported semiconductors in China exceeded imported oil.

** The United States fully controlled the global semiconductor market. ** In 2019, it was when [Trump administration will bring the main telecommunications manufacturer Huawei](https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20190516/huawei-ban-trump/)Late on the entity list. Although on the surface, listing Huawei in the entity list is a punishment for its violations -Huawei has been found to sell sanctions to Iran -but strategic interests immediately became obvious. Because the US semiconductor, software and other necessities cannot be obtained, Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, can only survive. "Sanctions against Huawei immediately kicked off," said Matt Siger, a researcher at the Chinese Science and Technology Ecosystem of the Carnegie International Peace Foundation. "The chips used by Chinese technology giants are made in the United States, or contain a large number of American components."

For a long time, export control law has been regarded as a long -lost mysterious area, and it is unlikely to be applied in the practice of US national projection. But after Huawei, the United States found its dominant position in the semiconductor supply chain was a powerful leverage that has not yet been used. Three companies in the United States dominate the chip design software market, which is used to configure billions of transistors for new chips. The market for advanced chip manufacturing tools is also concentrated. Only a few companies can effectively monopolize important machines or processes, and these companies are almost all American companies or companies that rely on American components. Each step of the supply chain runs through the United States, the United States Treaty Allies or Taiwan, and all these countries are operating in the US -led ecosystem. "We discovered by accident," Saine said. "Before we really know how to use these weapons, we started using them."

In May 2020, the Trump administration further tightened the policy. This time, Huawei was subject to "foreign direct product rules". This is a clause that was considered obscure in export control law. Under this terms, foreign products produced in American technology or software are all controlled by the United States. This is a comprehensive practice of external law: even if a piece of goods are manufactured and transported overseas in the United States, they have never entered the United States. The final finished product does not include native American parts or technology, but it can still be regarded as American products.

For Huawei, the implementation of this clause means that the company's sources of semiconductors are basically cut off. "This rule allows all semiconductors in the world to be subject to US law, because all chip foundries around the world have at least used American equipment to a certain extent." The husband said. "Even if there is only one American device in your foundry, and there are 100 other non -American devices, but the wafers on the entire production line are stained with the United States."

According to the data of the market analysis company Canalys, Huawei was [the world's largest smartphone seller] in 2020 [the world's largest smartphone seller](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smartphone-market-declines-q2-2020), Occupying 18%of the market share, even more than Apple and Samsung. In 2021, Huawei's revenue fell by nearly one -third, and it was maintained by selling a smartphone brand. By 2022, Huawei's global market share has fallen to 2%.These regulations have an unprecedented impact on the semiconductor supply chain. Not only can China not be able to import the most advanced chips, but also cannot obtain the input required by independent research and development of advanced semiconductors and supercomputers, and even the US native components, technology and software that can be used to produce semiconductor manufacturing equipment. These devices have allowed China to allow China to allow China to allow China Eventually built its own wafer factories and created its own chip. "This is the strategy of 'one pot'," said former BIS official Wolf. Some regulations are new initiatives, such as any "American", including enterprises, individuals, and green card holders and permanent residents -will be limited. After October 7, Americans are no longer allowed to engage in any activities that support advanced semiconductors in China, whether it is to repair the equipment of Chinese wafers, provide suggestions, or even authorize to deliver products to China semiconductor manufacturing products.

The decision to take a unilateral action is a diplomatic gambling. Although the United States has controlled many key bottlenecks on the global supply chain of the semiconductor, other countries, especially Taiwan, Japan, and the Netherlands -, also dominate the same key departments during the manufacturing process. If these countries continue to sell products to China as before, the control measures on October 7 are basically equivalent to the same. However, at the end of January, the Bayeng government reached an agreement with Japan and the Netherlands, which will have a semiconductor or semiconductor manufacturing equipment [Implementing similar management and control](https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230129/netherlands-japan-china-chips/)Essence

Taiwan signed an agreement when the control measures were announced in the past few months. The island is a chip manufacturing giant: semiconductor output accounts for two -thirds of the world's annual, 90%are the most advanced semiconductors. Most of Taiwan's semiconductor output comes from [TSMC, a company](https://cn.nytimes.com/technology/20221207/tsmc-chips-factory-phoenix/)It is the highest market value in Asia and the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturer. A TSMC company has accounted for one -third of the global chip foundry manufacturing market. (In contrast, the global oil market share controlled by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is about 40%.)

For the United States, Taiwan, which plays a core role in global chip manufacturing, is indispensable. If the wafer fab is occupied by China or shut down during the invasion, it will bring catastrophic consequences to the global economy. The life door held by Taiwan in the chip industry is sometimes called the "Silicon Shield". This is the island's most powerful deterrent against China's attacks, and it is also the ultimate guarantee for the help of the United States when it was invaded by China.

But the partnership between the United States and Taiwan is not equal. Although the level of chip manufacturing in Taiwan is unparalleled, it is calculated by revenue, and its global market share is less than 10%. Most sales (40%in 2022) flow to American companies that export chips to Taiwan, which is very similar to the way American clothing designers have made profits by selling product sales overseas. In terms of strategic, the US policy maker regards US dependence on Taiwan as an unacceptable risk. They have been pushing TSMC to build more wafer factories in the United States, which is part of the broader strategy of more semiconductor manufacturing near the United States coast.

Because of worrying about annoying this most powerful allies and the largest weapon supply country, Taiwan has no choice but only to obey; but as the United States continues to take measures to weaken the island's dominant position, Taiwan is making its situation more at stake. In the worst case, Taiwan's leading advantage on the chip may only lead to more damage: some American commentators and the war clamor have submitted their ideas that if China invades Taiwan, the United States should destroy TSMC's wafer fabal factory to prevent the TSMC's wafer fab to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC in case the United States should be destroyed to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC to prevent the TSMC in case the United States should be destroyed to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC to prevent the TSMC's wafer factory to prevent the TSMC to prevent the TSMC in case the United States should be destroyed. It fell into the hands of China.

** One of the difficulties to try to control semiconductor global circulation ** is that semiconductors are very small, light weight, and high value. "Smuggers like such goods," Allen said. However, China needs a large number of chips to drive large data centers and facilities equipped with cutting -edge computers, which makes purchases very difficult. "That's a large building that cannot be moved," Miller said. "It is very conducive to the exploration of American intelligence agencies." The composition of the semiconductor market has also made obstacles for everyone trying to avoid control: the number of companies that have the ability to produce cutting -edge chips are extremely limited, and there are not many buyers with chip purchase records in these companies.

However, there are also vulnerabilities in the system that performs control, which has attracted the temptation of Chinese enterprises. In March this year, the Chinese Enterprise Inspur Group, which is active in the field of cloud computing and server manufacturing, was included in the entity list. But [According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/loophole-allows-u-s-tech-exports-to-banned-chinese-firms-b4800164)At least one subsidiary of the company has not been included in the list, and American companies sell their products to them.

The route of chip circulation in China is also more roundabout. Last month, Reuters reported [Shenzhen high -end chip black market prosperity](https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-chinas-underground-market-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-2023-06-19/)In the case, many retailers claim that they can supply A100 chips, which is a powerful chip manufactured by the Nvidia. The US government's ability to detect and prevent this physical transaction is limited: BIS has only three law enforcement officers in China. But the existence of the black market is actually the early result of the effect of controlling control. Retailers interviewed by Reuters claim that these chips can only be supplied in small batches, which may be the inventory that is shipped to China before it takes into effect. "This highlights that control measures are playing a role," a industry executive who asked for anonymous to evaluate the US policy told me anonymous. "If the chip can flow freely, they will not do so."

The battle for chip control can be regarded as a test of norms. In the West, compliance responsibilities will be mainly on private companies. "Industry is our main line of defense," said BIS Export Management Assistant Minister Asia Rodzman KFLE. "Our government agencies will introduce clear, concise and effective regulations as possible, but the responsibilities of obeying and practicing these regulations lies in the industry." In order to ensure the effectiveness of control measures, the American industry must take at least 800 from 800 in the short term in the short term. Measures are cut with some of the profitable Chinese markets. American companies will have sufficient reasons to test on the legitimate margins, and Chinese companies also have sufficient motivation to drill the system vacancy to provide American companies with the information required for the sales.

For China, technology independent battle may bring unprecedented challenges. China's successful characteristics -solid political will, continuous funds, and the whole society mobilization around key goals -may become its fatal weakness. In the past few years, when the efforts of developing the domestic semiconductor industry have become more urgent, at least six chip projects spent billions of dollars have failed, and a large number of executives were investigated for suspected corruption. At the same time, countless enterprises have poured into the semiconductor industry, and some of them are almost completely chip laymen, just to get the government appropriations that can be obtained.But if you want to overcome such challenges, it is likely to be China. Although the export control on October 7, although the foreseeable future has a major blow to China's advanced chip manufacturing capabilities, it may finally stimulate its long -term growth. When Chinese companies can expose advanced Western chips and suppliers, domestic manufacturers cannot find any business. Now, Chinese companies do not unite to achieve innovation, and the end is to destroy together. "We eliminated the options," Kilkres said. "In the past, they could choose between national toughness and business development. Now this choice will no longer exist." If China is used for chip imports of 400 billion US dollars each year, a large part of it is used in China. In the end, you will get the way to catch up.

Huawei's case may be inspired again. Under the double blow of US sanctions and China's strict epidemic prevention and control, Huawei's profit in 2022 decreased sharply by 70%compared with the previous year. However, we can still see signs of life: Although the profit has fallen sharply, its revenue has increased slightly, and Huawei's Hongmeng operating system developed after being prohibited from using the Android system has more than 330 million installed capacity, most of which in China. Huawei is still one of the largest companies in the world. Last year's R & D budget was US $ 24 billion, and the scale of R & D team exceeded 100,000.

The emphasis on innovation is imperative. Without US chips and technology, Huawei was forced to redesign and manufacture all flagship products to ensure that these products do not include American parts. The company is driving the development of the entire domestic supply chain with its own power, and dispatched its own engineers to help training and enhance the level of Chinese suppliers. Huawei was reluctant to cooperate with these suppliers to choose foreign suppliers. Recent Bit. If Huawei can succeed, it may break through US sanctions, which is stronger and tough than ever.

** These control measures ** Do not curb China once and for all. Even in the ideal circumstances, they are just a delay tactics, aiming to provide the United States and its allies with space to expand key technologies. The problem is how much BIS can win for the West. "In this industry, one blow is not equal to success," said the assistant minister responsible for export law enforcement Matt Axelrod. "Our goal is to stop how much."

I met with Aksmann and Rockdler, who was in charge of export management in the office of the Ministry of Commerce, and could overlook the oval lawn in the center of Washington Special Economic Zone. It only takes a few minutes to finish almost the entire BIS headquarters. Even if these regulations do not require dripping without leakage, I still doubt that it is unfair to let the Industry and Security Bureau's power to fight the entire Chinese government. What is the victory of BIS? How can its movement catch the opponent? How could BIS pay attention to chips like China and invest so much money for this? For China, the future of chips is about the National Games.

After a brief silence, Razman Kendere made a reply softly. "This may also be related to our survival," she said.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T06-17-44-00-00/000187240_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

Dang Tristein Harris(Tristan Harris)When I realized that he wanted to warn the danger brought by the world media, he created the Humanities and Technology Center(Center for Humane Technology)Essence That was 2018, Harris was Google(Google)A designer originally wanted to study the addictive digital tools. At this time, the impact of "application" culture on our brain was afraid. Therefore, through his non -profit organization and "Social Dohaies"(The Social Dilemma)Waiting for documentary, he urged policy makers to pay attention.

Five years have passed, and it is obvious that policy makers have not heard. Although social media companies have promoted their improvement of supervision, their control is still relaxed. At the same time, just like Jonathan Heite(Jonathan Haidt)Scholars point out that with the rise of social networks, the mental health of young people has deteriorated sharply.

Last month, Harris and his colleague Aza Laskin(If you head)At the Institute of Speed in Aspen(Aspen Ideas Institute)I gave a speech on artificial intelligence, which may be the clearest and most shuddering explanation of artificial intelligence.

They believe that the threat brought by artificial intelligence is the extension of social media danger. Specifically, Harris quoted the metaphor of science fiction movies, "You can regard social media as the first real contact between humans and artificial intelligence." When artificial intelligence is used for management, "humans are lost" Essence

Now, "the second contact" is happening, because large machine learning models like ChatGPT not only manage content, but also create content. Harris believes that the reason why this stage is so terrible is because the diffusion speed of artificial intelligence tools is faster than before, and it is "learning" from the data how to get even artificial intelligence researchers. "Sudden" skill. As FT magazines were widely reported in April, the machine has recently completed some things without being taught. Google executive Jeff Dien(Jeffdean)Observed that although there are dozens of examples of emergence, there are almost no convincing explanations about why these capabilities appear. "

Insiders are increasingly difficult to track what happened, let alone outside people. A senior executive of a large artificial intelligence group recently told me that the problem is that there is no single code system for artificial intelligence programming so that the regulatory agency can check it, because the machine continues to learn and re -learn, and does not stay without leaving. trace.

What is worrying is that self -learning may also cause artificial intelligence to do unpredictable things, that is, the so -called "hallucinations", either because of data failure or people who have not been noticed in artificial intelligence commands, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, or other other people, either others are other Some factors we have not yet understood. For example, Harris and Laskin mentioned that researchers who trained the artificial intelligence platform to find less toxic pharmaceutical compounds found that a small change in the instructions caused them to find 40,000 toxic molecules, including VX neurotoxic agents.

There is also a more direct risk that makes another former Google researcher Jeffrey Sington(Geoffrey Hinton)Waiting for well -known science and technology people are worried: open source artificial intelligence tools make it easy for anyone to publish errors, and this information disguised as an impressive fact. As Harris lamented, "We should all pay attention to the military reserve competition in the field of artificial intelligence. I'm not sure if democracy can continue to exist."

Harris and Laskin have denied that they want to prohibit artificial intelligence; Laskin himself is also using it to promote the communication between humans and animals. But they do want reasonable restrictions on their development. These measures include suspending any more advanced open source artificial intelligence programs until the safety guardrail is constructed; strict control of chips for driving machine learning models (no chips will not happen); establish appropriate legal frameworks to allow enterprises The intelligent system is responsible when there is a failure; and the public awareness movement is carried out around the wrong information before the election in 2024.

Other artificial intelligence researchers who have talked to me recently seem to agree with this view. Shortly after Harris and Laskin's speech at Aspen, Google executive James Manica(JamesManyika)Published a speech and cooperated with policy makers. Microsoft, four major companies that develop artificial intelligence systems -Microsoft(Microsoft)The leaders of Google, Openai and Anthropic also met with the White House to discuss control issues.

However, the similarities between artificial intelligence and social media show that it is difficult for the government to challenge large technology companies, and it is also difficult to expect companies to conduct self -supervision while competing for market share. At present, politicians believe that the United States is fighting with China, and the difficulty of implementing the control of the American technology industry has doubled.

I eagerly hope that the artificial intelligence movement of Harris and Laskin can be successful, but it can only be achieved under the pressure of serious political will and strong voters' change. This is a task involving all of us. After messed up on social media, let us hope that we can do better in artificial intelligence. There is no time to waste.

![](Images/rficn/2023-07-13T06-32-07-00-00/000000.png)NATO headed by the United States is increasingly vigilant about China's gradually growing forces, so it is trying to strengthen cooperation with democratic countries in the Asian Pacific region.

NATO is holding a summit at the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, and has attended the second consecutive year in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korean leaders.

NATO has previously planned to open a liaison office in Tokyo to promote cooperation with Japan. However, France's shots were blocked, insisting that NATO should focus on protecting the responsibility of the European Atlantic region.

Emmanuelmacron said after the summit: "No matter what others say, geographical problems cannot be changed ... The Indo -Pacific region does not belong to the North Atlantic, so we must not make people feel that NATO seems to be establishing legitimacy in other regions and geographically establish it geographically A sense of existence. "

Some allies of diplomats disagree with Mark Hong's opposition.

Steten Berg met the Japanese Prime Minister Kishita, and insisted that the opening of a liaison office in Japan is still a "discussion" issue. He said that NATO wants to deepen cooperation with Japan in the fields of Internet and marine security.

Steten Berg said that NATO and the Asia -Pacific partner conference conveyed a message to the outside world: "Security is not just regional, but global, so we must really unite."

He pointed out: "China has invested heavily on new military capabilities, which proves this ... We expect that China will load 1,500 nuclear warheads on the missile by 2035. (Member State) territory. "

Steten Berg also said: "NATO did not become a global military alliance, but was aware that this area was facing global challenges. China's rise is one of them."

The United States regards China as the main global competitors, and has long been promoting the European allies within NATO to adopt a tougher stance on China.

The leader of NATO member states issued a statement yesterday to express concerns about Russia and China's "deepening strategic partnership", and called on the Chinese government to use its own influence to persuade Russia to stop the Ukraine war.

According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, Li Qiang listened to Alibaba Cloud, Douyin, Pinduoduo and other companies at this symposium on "Promoting the Healthy and Sustainable Development of Platform Economy Standards and Sustainable Development." "SME linkage innovation" and "expanding new employment based on the platform", "dare to work hard on the international stage to drive more Chinese manufacturing and Chinese services to go abroad."

According to reports, Li Qiang also emphasized that Chinese governments at all levels will strive to create a fair and competitive market environment, so that the platform economy supervision system is more sound, transparent, expected, and normalized to reduce the cost of corporate compliance operations.

Bloomberg reported that China's official positions on private companies have continued to change, making some analysts believe that China's huge Internet industry is not suitable for investment.

According to Reuters, Zhou Hao, executive of China Securities Corporation Guotai Junan, said that Wednesday's meeting was a "positive signal" and said that the health and prudent development of the platform economy were very important for investors' long -term valuation. According to the report, among companies participating in Wednesday, some of the Chinese companies listed in the United States rose before the market, and Alibaba Group's holding rose 2.2%, and Pinduer rose 2.7%.

According to the analysis of multiple media, Chinese regulators have repeatedly criticized the technology giants that have failed to protect the privacy and monopoly markets of the client, and punished illegal punishment, causing the total market value of the Chinese platform to evaporate more than 1.1 trillion dollars.

According to Bloomberg, China's official recently convened private enterprises to increase investment to boost the shrinking manufacturing, exports and consumer expenditures. In order to boost the real estate market, the Beijing government has also urged banks to provide developers with loans. In addition, Chinese President Xi Jinping recently called for expansion of economic opening up and focusing on strengthening trade and investment.

Reuters pointed out that although the Chinese authorities have recently released signals of loosening and suppression, some fund managers expect strict supervision and economic weakness to continue, so they will continue to avoid investing in China's platform industry.

Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng held a rare talks with the US Assistant National Defense Minister Latna in charge of Indo -Pacific Security on Wednesday (July 12) in the Pentagon.

Reuters reported that the Pentagon said in a brief statement that Xie Feng and Latna discussed the national defense relations between the two countries and "a series of international and regional security issues."

Pentagon spokesman Manas said that the meeting lasted about 90 minutes, during which Latna also emphasized that the Ministry of Defense is committed to maintaining the smooth channels of "military" communication between the United States and China.

The Chinese Embassy in the United States issued a press release saying that the Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng should meet with the United States Assistant National Defense Minister Latner.

Xie Feng said that a healthy and stable Sino -US relationship is in line with the common interests of the two countries. The three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win -win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping are the correct ways to get along with China and the United States in the new period. Xie Feng states his position on the relationship between the two countries and two armies, asking the United States to adopt action to eliminate obstacles and control differences. In accordance with the principles of the three joint communiqués of China and the United States, they will carefully deal with important sensitive issues such as Taiwan, and they will do with China to promote the relationship between the two countries and the two armies. Gradually return to the right track.

The two sides also exchanged views on issues that were concerned.

Sun Yun, a senior researcher at Stimsoncenter, Sun Yun, a senior researcher at Stimsoncenter, and the director of China Project and co -director of the East Asian Project, pointed out that Xie Feng and Latna were unusual, and the Chinese ambassador did not often meet with senior US defense officials. "This shows that China is at least responding to the concerns of the United States, but actual progress still takes time and negotiation."

Recently, the United States has successively visited China to try to promote high -level dialogue between the two sides. Following the US Secretary of State [Visit China in June](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/china/story20230618-1405448)After that, the Minister of Finance [Yellen also visited Beijing earlier this month](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/china/story20230706-1411378), Climate Special Envoy [Cry will also arrive in China next week](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/china/story20230712-1412983)Essence

However, China has previously refused to arrange for the Sino -US defense ministers in Singapore in June [Shangri -La dialogue](https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/xiang-ge-li-la-dui-hua)During the meeting, military communication between the two sides fell into stagnation. The Chinese side urged the United States to immediately revoke the sanctions against China Defense Director Li Shangfu, and adopted practical actions to clear the obstacles for dialogue communication.

Sun Yun pointed out that unless Washington resolves the sanctions on Li Shangfu, it is unlikely that Beijing to accept a ministerial meeting with the US Defense Minister Austin. She said that the meeting between Li Shangfu and Austin "is not necessarily a prerequisite for restoring the Minister of Defense in the two countries, but according to the agreement, this is reasonable."

Sun Guoxiang said that since the second season, China's economic data is not as good as market expectations. He has not reported good news: "Since the second season, the youth unemployment rate in mainland China has exceeded 20%, which is very serious. Dolochrome involves the slowdown in the economic development of mainland China in the next stage. If young employment is very difficult, it will exacerbate the phenomenon of "four non -youths' without falling in love, no marriage, no children, and not buying a house."

Sun Guoxiang analyzed that, compared with other data, China's total industry and corporate profits also decreased by 20%year -on -year. The reason why the profit cannot be created may be that foreign capital withdraws, or there is no way to provide cheap labor and land costs.

China Customs General Administration also pointed out that in the first half of the year, China imported and exported to the first major trading partner of 3.08 trillion yuan, an annual increase of 5.4 %, accounting for 15.3 % of the total import and export value; %, Accounting for 13.7 %; the import and export of countries along the “Belt and Road” increased by 9.8 %, an overall growth rate of 7.7 percentage points, accounting for 34.3 %, an increase of 2.4 percentage points year -on -year; The import and export of member states increased by 1.5 %. In addition, China's imports and exports to the United States were 2.25 trillion yuan, a decrease of 8.4 %, accounting for 11.2 %. In terms of cross -strait trade, the total value of bilateral imports and exports in the first half of the year was US $ 123.63 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 24.4 %, and the decline continued to narrow 1.1 percentage points from the previous May.

** Scholars: Structural changes in Chinese trading partners **

Liu Mengjun, director of the Institute of Mainland Research of the China Institute of Economics in Taiwan, accepted an interview with Radio Asia in Liberty. China ’s import and export territory has a structural transformation, and it has moved towards more diverse and decentralized characteristics. In the past, China and traditional trading partners, such as the United States or other advanced countries, have reduced the proportion of bilateral trade due to the US -China trade war, the increase in tariffs on the United States, and the US export control of the United States. However, China's total value of import and export of ASEAN, the "Belt and Road" and RCEP countries has increased significantly.

For example, Liu Mengjun made: "Electric vehicles exported to Russia and become an important market. For example, electric carrier car, lithium batteries, solar cells, exports have increased, replacing the old three in the new three, reflecting the world's way to go to a net zero carbon volume the trend of."

Liu Mengjun mentioned that electric vehicles have a lot to do with the overseas layout of their charging components. China has a lot of subsidies in this aspect of policies and has become an important export competitive energy. Beginning in April, China became the largest exporter in the field of electric vehicles.

Liu Mengjun said: "Because like Germany, Japan or Europe, withdrawing from the Russian market, it just happened to be in China. In addition, RCEP started at the beginning of last year (2022). Combined with the US -China trade war and scientific and technological warfare, foreign capital included Taiwanese businessmen and even land. Enterprises will move some production capacity to ASEAN and the "Belt and Road" country. The so -called supply chain relocation, or the trade that contains investment will also drive overseas exports, so ASEAN has become an important import and export country in China. "

Lu Daliang pointed out that China's foreign trade situation in the second half of the year has both pressure and confidence. It is mainly because the inflation of the developed economy is still at a high level. The geopolitical conflict continues, and the short -term external demand has insufficient power. The steady growth of China's foreign trade is still facing greater pressure.

North Korea announced on Thursday (July 13) that it had successfully tested the new intercontinental ballistic missile "Mars Cannon-18", and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un guided the test shooting.

South Korea's United Staff Headquarters said on Wednesday (12th) that North Korea was at 10 am on the same day, to the east sea near Pyongyang [a long -range ballistic missile](https://www.zaobao.com/news/world/story20230712-1413310)Essence The missile flight time is about 74 minutes, and 71 minutes of March 24, 2022, set the longest record in North Korean history.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T07-11-39-00-00/000187145_piclink.jpg)Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.

Every time, there will be news that "moving the United States" in the morning TV show in the United States, but it will surprise most Europeans with a sip of tea.

For example, "Good Morning America"(Good Morning America)A broadcast of a news about "fashionable gifts for colleagues baby": donate your limited paid holiday to pregnant colleagues, so that she can accompany the newborn some time to come back to work. A woman said she was grateful to go back to work with her baby for 12 weeks, thanks to the holidays donated by colleagues. Another TV station broadcast a news, talking about medical staff to donate paid vacation to colleagues with leukemia during the epidemic.

These are not isolated events. American Employer Association(American Society of Employers)A survey shows that about a quarter of the US employers have a "paid vacation donation plan". For example, a university provides an opportunity for his employees to donate his accumulated holidays to ... those colleagues who are seriously ill or have been seriously injured, but have been used up during the holidays. "

Everyone donated holidays because the American vacation system was too embarrassed. The United States does not have national legal paid maternity leave or paid leave. There are many alternatives in rich countries, and it is not too much. Organization(OECD)In the country, mothers enjoy paid maternity leave for nearly 19 weeks. In the UK, I took a rest for a year when I gave birth to a child, and most of my time was paid.

Whenever I hear that Europeans are worried about the economic strength of the European continent, I think of a strong contrast like the above. Isn't it that GDP is not important, but should all countries really use this indicator to measure their progress and compare each other?

This is not a new problem. From decades ago, people have been advocating that GDP is not enough to measure the prosperity or living standard of a country, but the efforts that try to formulate a set of better standards often cannot achieve strong results. The difficulty is that once you start thinking about which factors are important, it is difficult to determine when to stop. The "Better Life" index of Organization Organization(BetterLife index)Contains 11 different indicators. British National Bureau of Statistics(Office for National Statistics)Not far behind, the "national happiness" it prepares(national wellbeing)The index contains 44 indicators, from sports participation to trust in the government. Without paying attention, the "instrument panel" in front of you is already daunting: Although it contains a lot of very interesting information, it is difficult to help you judge the status of a country as a whole, let alone take a country and another A country compares.

It is best to measure the method. In my opinion, life expectancy is the most important supplementary indicator of the state of a country. This is a reliable and quantitative indicator based on mortality, and almost nothing else is more important than life and death. It is also affected by other factors that people are very concerned about, such as the treatment of women and children, food quality, medical care, education, pollution, employment and crime. Some people may say that "health expectations life"(healthylife expectancy)——In the expected number of people who can live in a healthy physical condition -it will be better, but the existing data is too subjective to support the persuasive comparison of the situation of various countries.

Of course, policy makers have begun to pay attention to the expected life. However, if politicians are as persistent as GDP and eager to compare their GDP with other countries, what will the world look like? Measured according to the expected life span, the United States is not an envy of other wealthy countries. Although the US economy is growing, the life expectancy of Americans is far behind the people of other wealthy countries. In 1980, the expected life of the United States was roughly the same as Italy and France, which was higher than Britain and Germany. By the 1990s, it had fallen to the last names of these countries, and now, some countries per capita GDP are far lower than that of the United States in the expected life expectancy. Talking about when China ’s GDP (or) will surpass the United States, but China’ s expected life span has quietly surpassed the United States.

It's not that GDP is not important. It represents the size of the pie, which helps to determine how much influence a country can play in the world and what life can provide for their people. Therefore, it is not unexpected that per capita GDP is often roughly related to the expected life span, but there are many exceptions. From this we can learn some lessons. The expected life rankings of some countries are higher than their economic strength rankings, such as Spain, Italy, and Japan. This is because the diet of these countries is healthier. The United States, which allows guns, eats a lot of processed foods, and social security, is far lower than its economic strength ranking.

Caring for health and hoping to affect policy makers or public people often try to emphasize the impact of health on the economy. McKinsey(McKinsey)A study declared: "Poor health status has a GDP that loses 15%of global losses each year." Another report said: "The current health status of people in the community in England 'is not good, causing nearly 30 billion pounds to the country each year. Lost, because people are often unable to work and die prematurely because they are too poor. "But this is completely reversed. GDP is not the purpose of we want to be healthy and longevity. On the contrary, we want GDP to be healthy and longevity.

There is nothing wrong with a benign competition between the country. However, on the issue of economic growth, we should not reverse our purpose and means.

The Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Agency, Nareshkin, has already discussed how to deal with the Ukrainian issue with Bernes, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Reuters quoted the Tas Society reported that Naresh Gold announced on Wednesday (July 12) the news of the phone call with Bernson. The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported on June 30 that Bernus called Nareshkin and guaranteed that the latter did not guarantee that the United States did not change in [June 24 Wagna soldiers on June 24](https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/world/story20230624-1407349)Play any role.

Narrashkin confirmed on Wednesday that Bernes did mention [Catches](https://www.zaobao.com/keywords/e-luo-si-bing-bian)However, he emphasized that in the process of calling for about an hour, most of the time was "considering and discussing how to deal with the Ukrainian issue."

The US -China Intelligence Bureau did not comment immediately.

Since the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, Nayleshkin has been communicating with Bernus, but US -Russian relations have fallen into a trough.

Ukraine claims that other countries should not be negotiated on behalf of Ukraine, and this position is also supported by the United States, emphasizing that if Ukraine is not present, there is no need to discuss the Ukrainian issue.

Nareshkin told Tas Society that war negotiations will become possible at a moment. "It will be possible sooner or later. This is a natural truth, because any conflict, including armed conflicts, will end with negotiations, but the conditions for negotiations still need to be mature."

President of Ukraine and peaceful negotiating representatives Podoliak told Reuters that people like Nareshkin have no influence on how the war ended. Russia is losing this war. Such people negotiate. "These Russian elites are completely lacking in their understanding of the incident, so there is nothing to talk about with them."

After the NATO summit, President Biden gave a speech on NATO at the University of Vernis, Lithuania.

** At the just -concluded NATO Summit, the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea (that is, "IP4", and the four countries in Indo -Pacific region were once again invited to attend, strengthening the cooperative relationship with NATO. About 31 member states in NATO issued a bulletin, which has issued the most strong condemnation to China so far. Beijing responded an angry response. **

In the two -day summit held in the Caluki capital of Lithuania, NATO leaders issued a tough statement, saying that China challenged NATO's interests, security and values with its "open ambitions and mandatory policies". And attack China's partnership with Russia.

"China uses a wide range of political, economic and military tools to increase its global involvement and projection power, while maintaining its own strategy, intent and military construction," NATO leaders said in the bulletin.

NATO's statement is based on the "strategic concept" released by the organization last year, which marks the first to mention China in NATO and point out the risks brought by its ambitions and policies.

Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of international relations at Bucknenelluniversity of Bucknellun (Bucknenelluniversity), pointed out that the NATO summit was held in the Capital capital of Lithuania. This has become a "urgent pioneer in European anti -China". ","

Professor Zhu Zhiqun believes that NATO has the intention to expand to the Asia -Pacific region and will further participate in the United States' containment of China, and the US -China relations and China -EU relations will also be more tense.

US President Biden and Ukrainian President Zeleki.

NATO leaders also condemned Sino -Russian relations, saying that China is "deepening strategic partnerships" with Russia and uses its economic strength to "make strategic dependence and enhance its influence."

NATO Secretary -General Jensstoltenberg said at a press conference on Tuesday: "China is increasingly challenging the rules -based international order, rejecting to condemn Russia's war on Ukraine, threatened Taiwan, and carried out a big big. Significant military construction. "

NATO leaders urged China to play a "constructive" role and condemned Russia for "constructive" and condemned Russia for "the war against Ukraine."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded at a press conference on July 12 that "Sino -Russian relations are based on the principles of not alliance, not confrontation, or targeting third parties. Establishing a paradigm of relations with great powers, which is essentially different from the NATO countries '"small circle' and camp confrontation."

Since the invasion of Ukraine in Russia, China has so far rejected condemnation of Russia's position and economically supports Russia. Chinese officials have accused NATO from the culprit of Russia and Ukraine's conflict, which is consistent with Russia.

It is worth noting that the day after the publication of the NATO Summit ’s public bulletin, a spokesman for the Kremlin Palace told the outside world: Putin’ s trip to China has “put on the agenda”, and the specific visit date will be announced after the final determination.

"Now it is definitely a good time to maintain high -speed development of bilateral relations in Russia," said the spokesman.

### Asia Pacific?

Japanese Prime Minister Kishita Nada and President Byden

NATO is promoting cooperation with the four Asia -Pacific countries, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. These four countries are firm supporters of Ukraine, and they all vowed to continue to provide assistance to Kiev.

The leaders of these four countries attended the NATO summit. They are worried that the tension caused by the relationship with China and North Korea will further intensify.

NATO hopes to set up a liaison office in Tokyo, Japan. If it is successful, this will be the first contact place in the Asia -Pacific region. But due to the strong opposition of France, the plan was frustrated.

France also criticized the relationship between China and Russia at this summit, but French President Macron said at a press conference after the summit that it is a good thing for NATO to establish partnership with countries in other regions. The security issues in Africa and the Middle East should not exceed geographical factors.

Macron emphasized that the "Indo -Pacific Region" is not the North Atlantic, and NATO should not try to expand geographically, and give people the impression of establishing recognition and geographical existence in other regions.

For example, South Korea, the partnership plan signed with NATO covers 11 areas. According to the plan, the two sides will hold advanced political and military conference routinely; strengthen national defense forces, and dig out opportunities for cooperation in the area of interoperability.

South Korea will also establish a negotiation mechanism with NATO to strengthen anti -terrorism forces and participate in NATO's counter -terrorism exercises; both parties will also strengthen online defense cooperation.

Professor Zhu Zhiqun pointed out that NATO lacks self -reflection and has not learned lessons from the Russian and Ukraine War. That is, when NATO expansion must consider the safety interests of all parties. Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not right, NATO East Expansion threatens Russia one of the main reasons, but NATO is unwilling to admit it.

He believes that for China, the four Asia -Pacific countries will participate in the NATO Summit, and China's security environment will continue to deteriorate. "NATO has the responsibility to explain the reasons for its eastward expansion and how to promote the security of the Asia -Pacific region, rather than a countermeasure."

Tesla founder Musk announced the establishment of artificial intelligence (AI) company XAI, and stated that the goal of the new company was "understanding the true nature of the universe" and answering the biggest question in life.

Comprehensive Agence France -Presse and American Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC) reported that the startup team of XAI includes researchers from the ChatGPT parent company OPENAI, Google DeepMind, Tesla, and the University of Toronto. Dr. Danhendrycks, the person in charge of Safety, had previously issued an open letter to a global leader to warn AI's threat to human survival than big abortion and nuclear war.

Musk has also repeatedly stated that AI is dangerous, saying that this technology is too fast to "summon the demon". He claimed that because of the reckless progress of Google's AI, he founded OpenAI in 2015. After leaving in 2018, he also publicly stated that he was uncomfortable with the profit -oriented management model and the company's development of OpenAI CEO Altman.

In an April interview with Fox News, Musk revealed that he would set up his own AI technology company, and shared the relevant details of the launch of the AI tool "TRUTHGPT" program.

The British "Financial Times" reported the news of start -up company XAI in April. At the same time, it was disclosed that Musk had obtained thousands of GPU processors from Nvidia to support large -scale language models that could be needed.

According to reports, Musk registered with XAI in Nevada, the United States in March this year. He had previously changed Twitter names to "XCORP." In some financial documents, but on the website of XAI, the company indicated as an independent enterprise. However, it will still "work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla and other companies to achieve our mission."

The author of this article is a scientific commentator

The deep sea has become invisible to the danger of the western barren. The final period for the United Nations to formulate the international waters' deep -sea mining regulations was deadlocked last Sunday, and all parties failed to reach an agreement.

This leads to a state without legal constraints. Green lights are turned on to apply for mining permits for various countries, which may trigger an unwise underwater exploration heat to find minerals related to green energy transformation. It is worth thinking about whether it is proper to plunder one of the least one of the areas on the earth. After all, this move may have an irreversible impact on marine habitats. Dipping off the surface of the sea bed may also interfere with carbon locked on the bottom of the sea for thousands of years, causing unknown consequences to the unknown climate.

The bottom of the ocean is vast, cold, and no light. The pressure is likely to be more than 1,000 times of land. Since the 1960s, its mining prospects have been quietly stunned. An attractive place is Crarine-Cleper(Clarion-Clipperton Zone)It is located in the Equator Pacific, with an area of at least 4.5 million square kilometers.

This deep -sea plain is more than 4 kilometers underwater, and the "multi -metal tuberculosis" full of potatoes is covered with potatoes.(polymetallic nodules)These tuberculosis contain manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt, which can be used for charging batteries of electric vehicles. Multi -metal tuberculosis is centered on microbes such as shells and teeth, and gradually accumulates after millions of years.

There are also surfaces rich in metal underwater peaks in this area; sulfide mines are deposited around the hot deep -sea spray mouth. Haishan shells are rich in precious metals such as platinum and molybdenum; sulfide ore contains copper, gold and silver. These are metals urgently needed in the fields of electronics, buildings and transportation.

However, these minerals are buried in the infrastructure of the marine infrastructure. This infrastructure has gathered for tens of millions of years, and is raw most unknown deep -sea creatures. It is known that biology includes sponges, sea cucumbers, octopus, and aliens. This is a strange single -cell creature of tennis. Circles and crustacean animals live in the soft seabed silt.

Deep sea mining will cause damage to these creatures and their habitats. Collecting multi -metal tuberculosis requires digging to the top layer of the bottom of the sea; separate the tuberculosis from the mud; use a pipe to pull the tuberculosis to the ship stopped on the sea; then send the residue to the sea.

Exite University(Exeter University)Ecologist Kelston Thompson(Kirsten Thompson)For green and peaceful organization(Greenpeace)After writing a report about the deep -sea mining, he questioned whether these minerals were really important as some people said whether some people said, and opposing an environment that we didn't know. "The blockbuster may occur permanently, and once it is lost, it can no longer be restored," she said to me. One disadvantage is that microorganisms may lose medical prospects; a Salinosporamide molecules taken from the ocean are testing to treat brain cancer.

The tuberculosis has not stopped. In June 2021, Xiaoguo Naulu informed the International Underwater Administration Bureau(ISA)Its intended to start deep -sea mining; the country's application triggered a two -year countdown. Today, the countdown is over; the International Underwater Administration will meet the next steps this month to discuss the next steps.

Norway, China and India are in favor of deep -sea mining; India has begun to study what methods can be adopted in the Indian Ocean. The rich tuberculosis of this sea area is expected to promote the self -sufficiency of nickel and cobalt. France and the United Kingdom have exploration permits, which are allowed by the International Underwater Administration, but the two countries currently do not support commercial deep -sea mining, and other European countries also hold the same position.

Supporters believe that collecting minerals from the bottom can break China's control of key raw materials in China and Russia; and deep -sea mining can replace land mining, which has a series of problems, such as abusing forests, using children's workers, and forcing communities to migrate. But do not naive that once the deep -sea mining is started, terrestrial mining will stop. The problem of social injustice will not exist at the bottom of the ocean: given that the international sea bed is a common heritage of human beings, it is not clear how to share plunder. One more realistic problem is that any industry needs customers, but like BMW(BMW), Volvo(Volvo)Samsung(Samsung)Waiting for companies to promise not to allow minerals collected in this way into their supply chain.

In the long run, a more wise approach is to try to break the global dependence on rare substances, rather than letting this dependence continue. Studying the new battery technology is generating in return; Tesla(Tesla)Ackless battery has been used. The call for strengthening recycling and utilization is increasing. Considering unknown risks and uncertain interests, deep -sea mining may be proven to be a concept of incomparable.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T09-03-52-08-00/19NUTRITION-MYTHS-master1050.jpg)Soy milk increases the risk of breast cancer. Fat -free foods healthier than high -fat foods. Vegetarian and vegetarians lack protein. Some wrong nutrition concepts seem to be lingering in American culture, just like a unpleasant song always lingering in your mind.

Therefore, in order to clarify the facts, we asked 10 top American nutrition experts a simple question: What are the nutrition misunderstandings you most hope to eliminate? Why? They said that.

** Misunderstanding 1: Fresh fruits and vegetables are always healthier than canned, frozen or dehydrated fruits and vegetables. **

Although people have always thought that "the fresh one is the best", [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1559827614522942)It is found that frozen, canned and dehydrated vegetables are as nutritious as fresh fruits and vegetables.

Sarah Blach, a professor of public health policies at the School of Public Health, Harvard University, who is about to leave, said: "They can save money and ensure that there are always fruits and vegetables at home in their homes. Simple method. "It should be noted that Blacic said that some canned, frozen and dehydrated fruits and vegetables contain harmful ingredients such as sugar, saturated fat and sodium, so be sure to read nutrition labels and choose to control these ingredients to the minimum limit. The product.

** Misunderstanding 2: All fats are not good. **

[Research published in the late 1940s found](https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article/63/2/139/772615)There is a correlation between high -fat diet and high cholesterol level, so experts infer that if the total fat content in the diet is reduced, the risk of heart disease will be reduced. By the 1980s, doctors, federal health experts, food industries and news media all reported that low -fat diet is good for everyone, although there is no conclusive evidence that this can prevent problems such as heart disease or overweight and obesity.

The Medical Assistant Professor of the Human Nutrition Center of the University of California, the Human Nutrition Center of Los Angeles Victoria Sulandi, said that the slander of fat leads to many people with food manufacturing refined carbohydrates (such as white flour and add sugar) to replace the fat in fat Caliba.(Remember Snackwell?)"This approach not only does not keep the country slim, but the proportion of overweight and obesity has increased significantly," she said.

In fact, Su Lanpty also said that not all fats are harmful. Although some types of fat, including saturated fat and trans fats, will increase the risk of heart disease or stroke, but healthy fat -such as monounsaturated fats (exist in olive oil and other vegetable oils, avocados and avocados, and avocado and avocado and avocado Some nuts and seeds) and polyunsaturated fats (exist in sunflowers and other vegetable oils, walnuts, fish and linen seeds) -actually help to reduce risk. Good fat also helps to provide energy, produce important hormones, support cell function, and help absorb certain nutrients.

If you see a product marked with "zero fat", don't think of it for granted that it is healthy, Sura Pudi said. On the contrary, priority choice products with simple ingredients and not adding sugar.

** Misunderstanding 3: "Calculating is greater than consumption" is the most important factor in long -term weight gain. **

Indeed, if you consume more calories than burning calories, you may gain weight. If your burning calories are more calorie, you may lose weight -at least in the short term.

However, research does not indicate that eating more will lead to continuous weight gain, which will lead to overweight or obesity. Darish Mozhafarian, a professor of nutrition and medical at the University of Friedman University, said, "On the contrary, the types of food we eat may be a long -term driving factor that leads to these situations." Super processed foods -such as refined starch snacks, grains, biscuits, energy sticks, baked foods, soda and candy -particularly harmful to healthy weight, because they will be quickly digested, making the blood full of glucose, fructose and amino acids in the blood, These substances are converted into fat by the liver. On the contrary, what needs to be needed for healthy weight is not so much computing, it is better to give priority to the healthy diet -the quality is higher than the quantity.

** Misunderstanding 4: Patients with type II diabetes should not eat fruits. **

This misunderstanding stems from mixing fruit juice and fruits. The juice has high sugar content and low fiber content, which will increase blood sugar levels.

However, studies have found that patients with diabetes should not eat fruits. For example, [some studies indicate](https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001)The risk of eating a complete fruit daily with a complete fruit is low_ —— especially blueberries, grapes and apples. [There are also some studies to indicate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31238615/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20fruit%20consumption%20of,0.59%2D0.78\)%2C%20respectively.)If you already have II diabetes, eating complete fruits can help control blood sugar.

It is time to break this misunderstanding. Linda Schii, the director of the medical institution of San Francisco Caesar Medical Institution, the director of cooking medicine and lifestyle, said that everyone -including patients with type II diabetes -can all from fruits, vitamins, vitamins, vitamins, vitamins, and vitamins It benefits from healthy nutrients such as minerals and antioxidants.

** Misunderstanding 5: Plant milk is healthier than milk. **

People think [plant milk](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/style/plant-milk.html)For example, milk made of oats, almonds, rice and marijuana seeds is more nutritious than milk. "This is wrong," said the professor of sustainable food system at Arizona State University, and former Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Catherine Mirigan, the Ministry of Agriculture. Take protein, for example: Generally, a cup of milk (about 236 ml) contains about eight grams of protein, and almond milk usually contains about one or two grams of protein. Each cup of oat milk usually contains about two or three grams of protein. Mirigan said that although the nutritional content of plant -based drinks may be different, many plant -based drinks contain more adding ingredients than milk, such as sodium and adding sugar. These ingredients may not be conducive to physical health.

** Misunderstanding 6: White potatoes are not good for the body. **

Tudou is often criticized in the nutritional world, because their blood glucose index is very high, which means that they contain fast digestive carbohydrates and may cause blood sugar to rise. However, John Hopkins's livable future central food community and public health project official Dafenni Aldma Johnson said potatoes are actually good for health. They are rich in vitamin C, potassium, fiber and other nutrients, especially when they do not peel and eat. Their prices are also very cheap, and they are sold throughout the year in food stores, which are very easy to buy. Barbecue, baking, boiling, and air fried are more healthy preparation methods.advertise

Over the years, experts have told new parents that the best way to prevent children from having food allergies is to avoid feeding them with common allergic foods such as peanuts or eggs in the first few years after their birth. But now, allergic experts say, [It is best to try to spend production products as soon as possible](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/well/eat/feed-your-kids-peanuts-early-and-often-new-guidelines-urge.html)Essence

If your baby does not have severe eczema or known food allergies, you can start introducing peanut products when you are preparing to accept supplementary food 4 to 6 months (such as diluted peanut butter, peanut puffs or peanut powder, but do not give the whole peanut To. Dr. Lugu Gulpta, a faculty professor at Fanberg Medical College, Director of Food Allergies and Asthma Research Center in Northwest China, said that the mix of peanut butter without granules with water, breast milk, or formula milk is fed to the child. three times. If your baby has severe eczema, please consult a pediatrician or a specialist at allergies to learn if you start using flower production products in about 4 months. "In the first year of the baby's birth, it is also important to prevent food allergies to prevent food allergies," Gaputa said.

** Misunderstanding 8: The protein in plants is incomplete. **

"‘ What do you rely on to get protein? ’Is the most often asked by vegetarians," said Christopher Gardner, a nutritionist and a professor at Stanford University. He said, "People mistakenly believe that there are no certain amino acids in plants," these amino acids are also called part of protein. But in fact, all plant foods contain all 20 amino acids, including all nine essential amino acids, Gedner said; the difference is that the proportion of these amino acids is not as ideal as the proportion of amino acids in animal foods. Therefore, in order to get a sufficient combination, you only need to eat a variety of plant foods in the day, such as beans, grains and nuts, and ingest enough total protein. Fortunately, most Americans ingest the protein daily. "This is easier than most people think," Caldner said.

** Misunderstanding Nine: Eating soy food will increase the risk of breast cancer. **

It is found in animal research that high -dose plant estrogen isoflavones in soybeans can stimulate the growth of breast tumor cells. "However, this relationship has not been confirmed in human research," said Dr. Hu Bingchang, a professor and director of the Department of Nutrition of Harvard Chen Zengxi Public Health. So far, science has not yet indicated that the soybean intake is related to the risk of human breast cancer. On the contrary, consumption of soybean foods and drinks -such as tofu, tempeh, edamame, miso and soy milk -may even have a protective effect on the risk of breast cancer and increase the survival rate of the disease. "Soy foods are also rich in beneficial nutrients related to the risk of heart disease, such as high -quality protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals," said Hu Bingchang. The research is clear: you can rest assured that the soybean food is included in the diet.

** Misunderstanding Ten: Basic nutritional advice is always changing -and a lot of change. **

Dr. Marine Nest, a honorary professor of nutrition, food research and public health at New York University, said that this is not the case. "In the 1950s, the first dietary suggestion to prevent obesity, II diabetes, heart disease, etc. requires balanced heat and minimize foods of high saturated fat, high salt and high sugar. The current American dietary guide also has the same requirements." Yes, science is constantly developing, but the basic diet guidance is still the same. Just as the author's simple theme of Michael Polish refined: "Don't eat too much food, don't have too many plants." Nest said that this proposal was valid 70 years ago, and it is still valid today. This allows you to have sufficient room when choosing food you love to eat.

UN Secretary -General Gutres believes that Russian President Putin is guaranteed to ensure the continued operation of the Black Sea Grain Export Initiative and the further implementation of the further implementation of the Memorandum of understanding of the Russian.

UN Secretary -General spokesman Diyrik issued a statement on Wednesday (July 12) announced the above news. The statement pointed out that Gutres has always attached great importance to ensuring that Russia and Ukraine's food and fertilizers can continue to enter the global market and promote global food security. The comprehensive implementation of the Black Sea Food initiative signed in 2022 is essential to ensure that the smooth, efficient, and large -scale entering the global market of Russia and Udnnn.

In 2022, after the United Nations mediation, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey jointly signed the "Black Sea Grace Export Initiative" to allow safe maritime humanitarian corridors to export grains, other foods and ammonia including three major ports in Ukraine, including three major ports in Ukraine. Chemical fertilizer. Russia also signed a memorandum of understanding at the same time with the United Nations, demanding that Russia's food and fertilizer can also enter the international market.

The implementation of the initiative has been for nearly a year, and it has been extended three times, and it will now expire again next Monday (17th).

In the statement, Diaryk emphasized that the goal of Gutres' letter on Tuesday (11) was "eliminating the obstacles faced by Russian Agricultural Bank of Agricultural Bank in financial transactions. This is a major concern expressed by Russia. At the same time, Ukraine's food is allowed to continue exporting through the Black Sea. "

Russia has repeatedly stated that the agreement on the normalization of Russian food and fertilizer exports has not been fulfilled so far, so there is no reason to continue to extend the Black Sea initiative.

Reuters reported that a key requirement for Moscow is to reinterpret Russia's Rosselkhozbank to the Global Bank Finance and Telecommunications Association (SWIFT). After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, the European Union cut off the connection between the bank and SWIFT in June 2022. EU spokesman said in May this year that the EU does not consider restoring connections.

However, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday that the European Union is considering connecting a subsidiary of the Russian Agricultural Bank to SWIFT, which is specially used for food and fertilizer transactions. The European Commission has not responded.

In the statement, Diaryk said that Gutres's primary concern is still the vulnerable people around the world. Once the Black Sea initiative cannot continue to be fulfilled, the prices of global grain and fertilizer may rise again, which will bring the greatest loss to the vulnerable people around the world.

Gutres will continue to contact all related parties on this issue and expressed his willingness to further contact Russia for his proposal.

Hugh Edwardz on the "10th News" program

** Recently reported that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) anchor involved in improper behavior was recognized as the host of the flagship program, Huwedwards, the host of the flagship show. The BBC is starting to investigate Edwardz's behavior. **

After many consecutive reports and speculation of the outside world and major media, Edwardz's wife Vickyfling issued a statement on behalf of her husband, confirming that Edwardz was the host involved, and said that he was because he was because Serious mental health problems are hospitalized.

The statement stated: "Given the recent report on the" BBC host ", I issued this statement on behalf of my husband Hugh Edwardz. After five days of experience for our family, I did this mainly for his Think of mental health and protect our children. "

"Xiezheng encountered serious mental health problems. Just as detailed records, he has been treated in recent years due to severe depression."

"The incident in the past few days has severely intensified the problem. He experienced another serious disease. He is currently being hospitalized and will still stay here for a period of foreseeable periods."

She said that after his health improved, he would respond to his reports.

Earlier, The Sun claimed that Edwardz paid a young man in exchange for explicit pictures.

Tim Davie, President of BBC, said that all employees said: "This is a reminder. In the past few days, personal life has been shown under the public's vision. family."

### Related allegations start and end

Last Friday (July 7), the "Sun" published a report saying that an unknown BBC anchor was accused of paying thousands of pounds to a 20 -year -old young man for many years in exchange for explicit photos.

The young man's mother expressed her concerns about these payment behaviors in the interview and worried that the money was addicted to supporting her child.

In the next few days, the "Sun" has published more allegations and reports one after another. The BBC also reports to related events like other institutions.

Edwardz's wife confirmed that her husband was a recent report.

On Sunday, the BBC acknowledged that the report of follow -up of these allegations in the "Sun" has received a complaint related to the initial allegations of the newspaper, and a suspension of a male employee had been suspended at the time.

The next day, a representative of a young man involved in the incident said that the report of the Sun is "nonsense" and denied any criminal acts.

Soon after, the "Sun" and BBC reported other different allegations about the same anchor, including sending "intimidation" information to a 20 -year -old young man, and visiting another person during the blockade of the new crown epidemic. And send inappropriate information to a BBC employee.

On Wednesday, a series of progress was announced in 10 minutes. First, the London Police Department stated that there was no evidence of criminal behavior after investigation, and then the BBC said that the internal investigation of related companies will continue.

Hugh Edwardz, as the value of the BBC anchor involved, was confirmed in a statement issued by his wife.

Image adding text,

Edwardz is one of the most well -known news anchors in the UK.

### "No crime"

Edwardz's wife expressed in a statement issued by the Social Agency (PA) that he hoped to confirm his identity and end the outside world's speculation about other unrelated BBC anchors.

Freins said that her husband was "told for the first time to make allegations to him last Thursday."

In a statement, she called on people to respect the privacy of their families, and at the same time pointed out that there was a public record that Edwardz had mental health problems in the past.

A few minutes before the family statement was issued, the British police issued another separate statement, saying that after discussions with the BBC management, there have been recent evaluations of relevant allegations.

"Actaries of the Specialist Crime Command of the London Police Department have completed the evaluation and concluded that there was no information that there was a criminal criminal act."

"When making this decision, they have discussed with many parties, including the BBC, the complaints involved, and the families of the complaints involved. These are carried out by another police department."

The statement also pointed out that the agent has "learned more about the media reporting more allegations of the same person", but there was no "any specific details or information about these allegations ... so no police actions are currently adopted."

The BBC has previously suspended the company's internal investigation at the request of the police. Now that the Police evaluation is completed, the BBC will continue its "factual investigation".

A BBC spokesman said: "We will continue the work in this area, and at the same time ensure that the facts are comprehensively evaluated in accordance with legitimate procedures, and keep in mind our care responsibility for all relevant personnel."

BBC President Tim David said in an email to employees: "This is still a very complicated situation."

He pointed out that the statement issued by the Edward's family was "a reminder, and his personal life was shown in the public view in the past few days." At the same time, he also said: "The core of all these is human and their families."

"There is no doubt that after a few days of testing, it is difficult for many people. I want to guarantee you that what we are currently concerned about is the responsibility of all relevant personnel."

### Why did you not disclose your identity before?

Unlike the United States, Britain does not have a comprehensive "First Amendment" to protect freedom of speech, so most news reports are bound by privacy and defamation regulations.

The British Supreme Court made an important ruling last year, covering those who are under investigation by law enforcement agencies -which means that they will be protected by the Privacy Law before being officially prosecuted for crime and sent to court.

Edwardz has never been officially investigated by the police.

At the same time, the British defamation law protects personal reputation from huge damage caused by lies.The newspaper was defended based on the testimony of Depp's ex -wife Amber Heard, and Depp eventually defeated in London's defamation case.

It seemed to highlight the differences in the British and American legal environment. Depp later won almost the same lawsuit in the United States, forcing Hed to reach a reconciliation.

Therefore, the reason why this time has not disclosed Edwardz's identity is to consider the high risk that may cause privacy or slander lawsuits -or even the combination of the two.

The young people involved denied the initial allegations and further increased the threshold for disclosure of the anchor identity.

### What may happen next?

Hugh Edersz's wife said that when his situation allowed, he responded to his reports.

The BBC said that the police have now ruled out the crime and the company's investigation will continue.

But the question of BBC still exists -about the company's previous understanding of allegations, when to understand, and responding to it.

The "Sun" has stated that it will cooperate with the BBC and stated that they will not have to further report the allegations of Edwardz.

The president of BBC said: "This is still a very complicated situation."

### Hugh Edwardz?

Hugh Edwardz is one of the most well -known broadcast hosts in the UK.

He joined the BBC as an intern in 1984. In the 1990s, he became the chief political reporter of the British Parliament in BBC, and gradually became the main host in the news channel in the following years.

In recent years, he has also become a representative of the BBC election.

The most important moment in his studio may be in September last year, when he announced the news of the death of the Queen Elizabeth II for the BBC.

On the morning, he learned that the Queen's health situation was rumored to go to work in advance, and began to report from 2 pm. Until wearing a black tie on the night of the night, he announced the news of the Queen's death to the whole country.

After that, he presided over the funeral report of the Queen of England, and his colleagues and his colleagues won the Tric of the British Television and Broadcasting Club (TRIC) awarded last month.

As the most senior news anchor of BBC, he is often chosen as a news host of British historic moment, reflecting that he has been highly evaluated and trusted by the audience within the company.

In 2021, Edwardz revealed in an interview that due to the requirements of the job, he may not have been the BBC chief news anchor for too long.

"Reporting evening news every night in 20 years may be exhausted," he said. "I want to make the audience change some changes."

In the same year, he revealed that he had suffered from depression in a documentary in Welsh, and he had "bed in bed" in the struggle with mental health.

Recently, on Wednesday before the exposure, he reported on Edinburgh that Scotland was preparing to welcome the news of King Charles, which was the last time he appeared in the BBC.

### BBC's scandal crisis in recent years

This is the latest scandal after BBC's series of major crises. In recent years, this company has faced doubts in many incidents, including false accusations of Sir Cliffrichard in 2018 to handle the false allegations of Sir Cliffrichard, Jimmysavile, a child of childhood. Understanding the relevant situation in BBC, and how to obtain controversial interviews by Princess Diana in the 1990s, etc.

Outside Britain, the BBC mainly obtains funds through advertising. However, in the UK, the BBC is operated with a public -funded television license fee -this is the cost of mandatory levies to every family with TV.

The BBC provides TV content to the family, including news, sports events live broadcasts, film and television dramas and current affairs programs. It is broadcast on dozens of places and radio stations across the country. In addition, there are streaming media platforms, news and sports websites, as well as mobile phone applications for weather forecasting.

The BBC's public funding model in the UK has made BBC and their employees rationally examined. At the same time, this has also triggered criticism of licensing fees, content output, and BBC's dominant position in the British media.

###  BBC How to report BBC?

In this type of incident, the way BBC news reporters treat BBC like reporting any other institutions.

As reported to any other institution, the BBC News Department must seek response from the BBC management or BBC affairs department and contacted the BBC news office to obtain an official statement.

In some cases, the BBC press conference is looking for high -level managers to conduct an interview with unplanted planning -this is called "Doorsteps" in the news industry.

Sometimes, they also get an interview with Mr. David in the disputes of Gary Lineker (Nicassa).

At this time, they will know that their accountability and effectiveness of their bosses will be examined inside and outside the BBC.

Propaganda and enrollment, several of them will also set up a stall at the Entry Expo, allowing students to register for interviews on the spot with the scientific transcripts, setting off a wave of waves. This boom was 685 in 2017 and 858 in 2018, while the first year of school broke through a thousand people in 2019. At that time, 1,021 Taiwanese students went to Hong Kong to study university. Even if Hong Kong broke out in 2014, the idea of going to Hong Kong did not dispel the students to Hong Kong at that time. Tanya and Chen Wei'an were two students who set off after that. Tanya recalled, "When I was young, I wanted to leave Taiwan to take a look at other places. In addition, I am determined to be in the business school. The international environment of Hong Kong is full of ideal places." Under the support of scholarships, Tanya enrolled in 2016 A school business school, at that time, the umbrella was about to be two years and the conflict between Mong Kok was 4 months. Although she knew the politics of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, she still drew a line for herself: "When Hong Kong does not have Google and Facebook, I will leave." Chen Wei'an, who graduated from the Normal University, accepted Hong Kong at the same time in 2018 at the same time. The Law Department of the Chinese University and the Law Department of Taiwan University once hesitated. "I was very impressed. One day in the middle of the night, I talked to a high school classmate and I was super anxious. I studied the topics I wanted to do, such as Gender Research, Hong Kong Basic Law, and China's united front intention is… but I don't know if there is still academic freedom in Hong Kong before graduating from college? "In the end, the reason he decided to start is," If Hong Kong will one day "like that", while Hong Kong or Hong Kong, I think Take a look at her. "However, before the first semester of going to Hong Kong and the backblocking movement, Chen Wei'an decided to return to the National Taiwan University for studying (Chen You completed the registration of the National Taiwan University and handled a suspension). "I don't seem to find my life I want in Hong Kong. I have tried to find some friends who care about politics, but I think it is too desperate. I can't stand it. The sense of powerlessness is terrifying and I will suffocate."

Finally, he decided not to stay in Hong Kong and choose to return to Taiwan. (Photography / Huang Shize) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T10-00-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/baodaozheshijian/mrpt-07122023093345.html/02chen.jpg)In the past three years, the huge changes in Hong Kong have made many students like Chen Wei'an no longer stay in Hong Kong and choose to return to Taiwan -the most intense in the second half of 2019 in Hong Kong, a total of about 170 people (108 academic year No. 108 The number of students who returned to Taiwan in the first semester of the second semester and the first semester of the 109 school year). After the end of the movement and the slowing of the COVID-19 epidemic, Taiwanese students went to Hong Kong to study abroad, and they were no longer ascending of the year. Ye Jiaxing, who has long served as a business school of the Chinese University of Hong Kong for a long time, accepted an interview with the "Reporter" who has participated in the enrollment activities of Taiwan. About 50 to 60 Taiwanese students, "However, the number of applicants has fallen in recent years. Looking back, I want to ask the total number of Taiwanese students who have been studying in Hong Kong in the past three years. However, since 2018, the Hong Kong government has stopped issuing or updating the visa of the Taiwan delegation in Hong Kong on the grounds that the Hong Kong government refused to sign the "one Chinese commitment letter". The number of students going to Hong Kong. The "Reporter" has therefore learned about the changes in the number of students in Taiwan in Hong Kong in Hong Kong through investigating statistics in the overseas Chinese community in Hong Kong and Macao.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T10-00-00-04-00/000004.png)"Reporter" further contacts the Normal University with a large number of people in Hong Kong and 8 female middle school high schools in the Normal University. Most schools feel that the issues are sensitive, or colleagues who are not familiar with related businesses in the school are unwilling to interview. However, a public high school counselor who was unwilling to be named in the north said that before 2019, about 10 students in the school went to Hong Kong to advance to school each year, and in the past three years, they fell to 2 to 3 people per year. A public high school counseling director in the south also pointed out to us that about 1 to 3 students went to Hong Kong to study each year. In the past 3 years, no one went to Hong Kong for school. **** ** The steering of Hong Kong admissions resources, policies and public opinion atmosphere **Ye Jiaxing believes that there may be three reasons for the decline in the number of students in Hong Kong and Taiwan: first of all, due to the impact of the epidemic, the number of overseas study abroad is generally reduced; second, the admissions committee found that some Taiwanese students received scholarships, but they only returned after only one year as Gapyear. Taiwan, so the school has reduced the investment in resources; in the end, in recent years, in cooperation with policies, Hong Kong universities have improved their admission places for the country's "Belt and Road" policy cooperation countries. Taiwan enrolls, but now I often go to Central Asia, Singapore and other countries. "In fact, although Hong Kong universities still have advantages in international rankings, Hong Kong is moving towards China's austerity remarks step by step. Lin Zonghong, a researcher at the Institute of Social Sciences and Director of the Contemporary China Research Center of Tsinghua University, pointed out that Chinese scholars in Hong Kong have long accounted for one -third, but the focus is not the amount of scholars, but the qualitative of scholars. He went to Hong Kong to study for a PhD from 2005 to 2008. As Hong Kong was a heavy town in China, the professors were all generations of liberals or June 4th. Scholars who stay in Hong Kong now, whether they criticize Hong Kong or China, will be more cautious. "Previously, you scolded the June 4th, or that the Communist Party of China had not committed the law, but now it is illegal, so this gap is very large." In March of this year, Hong Kong City University invited several high school principals and directors of Taiwan to participate in the uninvited meeting. , Explain the admission method, and share the wonderful study abroad life by the school. During the dinner, a teacher mentioned that the social movement significantly affected the willingness of students to go to Hong Kong. The admissions team responded that "the campus is the campus, and the current Hong Kong is very calm." In May, Guo Qi, the president of the City University of Hong Kong, also continued to publicize the "separation of politics and religion separation. "The enrollment slogan hopes not to affect students' willingness to go to Hong Kong.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T10-00-00-04-00/000007.png)The "separation of politics and religion" is usually used to refer to the division of power involving the government and religious institutions. In recent years, it has become the enrollment slogan of the city university in Hong Kong, emphasizing "politics to politics, education and education." However, the school did not specifically explain how politics and education should be truly separated under the National Security Law.

What new challenges will the students going to Hong Kong in 2023? Daniel, who plans to study abroad overseas, focuses on the ranking and English teaching environment of Hong Kong schools, and tuition fees compared to European and American universities. In August 2019, he went to Hong Kong to study business school. However, the occurrence of the movement of the campaign has allowed the teachers and family members to persuade him one after another, so that he once considered staying at the National Taiwan University: "It mainly considers his personal safety, and the picture of throwing gasoline bombs and smoke bombs on the news occurs in every corner of Hong Kong. . "Until I learned from the senior sister of Hong Kong, I learned," If you are afraid, don't go out in the dormitory to avoid the demonstration area. "After confirming that Hong Kong is still" safe ", Daniel turned back to persuade my family:" Anyway The political situation in Hong Kong should not affect his studies. "Henry, who went to Hong Kong to study in Hong Kong in the same year as Daniel, was decided to go to Hong Kong after accidentally obtaining scholarships. At the time of August, he didn't worry too much about the motion of the delivery in the carrier: "From the perspective of the Taiwanese, demonstration is not a surprising thing. Demonstration is a demonstration, isn't the demonstration normal? "(Note: Students who apply for enrollment in the fall of 2019 will receive the admission notice from various schools in Hong Kong since February 2019, and reply to accept or abandon the enrollment qualification within the prescribed period of each school. Sending the Movement Movement has not yet begun. When the secondary movement occurred in June 2019, even if the students were qualified for enrollment, they had not yet flew to Hong Kong. The outbreak of the epidemic, the implementation of the "restriction order" of the Hong Kong Government, tightening law enforcement, and gradually silent in the departure of the central movement. In June of the same year, the Hong Kong version of the "National Security Law" passed. Elaine went to Hong Kong to study that year. Elaine, who is interested in the study of biotechnology, considers that "Taiwan's life science -related industries have not developed very well", and the test results may not be able to apply for the top department of life sciences in China, and decided to choose "the world ranking is better than the National Taiwan University". Hong Kong school, "My mother said at that time, we have to do the opposite, and others dare not go to Hong Kong because they are not delivered to Hong Kong, then we have to go." Many students also found that the difficulty of applying for application in Hong Kong has decreased. In the future, there may be scholarships. For example, in 2019, he abandoned the admission because of his family concerns about it, and stayed in Taiwan for two years. After applying for a second application in 2021, he admitted to the Florence of a school business school and said: "I took the same one at the time of the second application. Registration for scientific test results, the scholarship that could not be applied for the second time, actually received half of the amount. "Even for some Taiwanese students, the silence of the somewhat movement means that the personal safety is carefree. Several interviewed students mentioned that the "National Security Law" made Hong Kong calm, and some people said that "no one will be chaotic" because Hong Kong has gradually become the second China. ** How much "normal" is the daily life of "National Security Law on Life"? **

Students also supported white paper in Hong Kong University. However, under the intimidation of the National Security Law, Hong Kong people generally responded cautiously.

"One day I received a notice. A class has been published to the curriculum website and has to be completed." EDGAR and others who enrolled in 2022 are the first foreign students who need to take Hong Kong National Security Education Course -this is Hong Kong After the "National Security Law" passed, the new policy implemented by colleges and universities in Hong Kong. The National Security Education Policy that has been implemented in 2022 requires students to complete the courses ranging from 0 to 3 credits and pass the exam to meet the graduation threshold. Whether it is LocalStuders or Non-Local Students from China, Taiwan or other countries from China, Taiwan or other countries. Click on the curriculum module, which covers the history of modern China and the "National Security Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region". The same test questions are the same. In 2015, EDGAR, who went to Hong Kong, stayed in Hong Kong's financial industry after graduation. Now he uses work hours to study for a master's degree. In an interview, EDGAR opened the website to let us watch the test questions of the national security curriculum simultaneously. Some social movement adaptations are put on. "Which of the following behaviors may be accused of violating the" National Security Law "in violation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region? 1 \. On June 19, 2018, a group of people planned to attack the facilities and buildings of the district government office. 2 \. On August 3, 2020, Sam contacted international organizations to call for overseas sanctions against Hong Kong. 3 \. On June 29, 2019, a group of people released a message on the online forum, announcing that Hong Kong was independent of China. 4 \. On July 1, 2021, Sam donated $ 500 to an international organization for attacking Hong Kong. Answer: All above. However, EDGAR smiled easily and said that he didn't watch any course videos at all, and went straight to the online test. "Anyway, you don't conform to your logic. Or, or what you respect history, these are the answers. "The test website showed that after writing 10 questions, the questions were all answered all the right, only 6 minutes. When asked about the impression of the exam process, Edgar said: "That test question is the same as the promotion of" CCTV ". ) There will be advertisements such as subways, such as the four persistence of Comrade Xi Jinping and the governance of the Patriot. Especially last year is the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's delivery. This method allows everyone to understand and become the standard of graduation. I feel full of disgusting. I am not interested in Hong Kong, Chinese history, and the National Security Law today. Why do you see it? If you are interested, you will learn from the Internet by yourself. "In fact, this is the first time that the Hong Kong government has tried to implement the Guoan Education Course in the past 10 years. After the Hong Kong Edition "National Security Law" in July 2020, the Hong Kong Education Bureau based on Article 10 of the National Security Law "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should carry out national security education through schools, social organizations, media, and networks to improve the residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The national security awareness and law -abiding awareness "implement related courses, and promulgated the Hong Kong National Security Education Course Framework in 2021, requiring primary and secondary schools to provide national security education courses, and removing books that may violate the National Security Law. Colleges and universities also include the national security education courses in the threshold for compulsory or graduation.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T10-00-00-04-00/000013.png)** "The final test of my Guoan Education Period is the Li Zhiying case" ** ***** 2022 Gavin, who went to Hong Kong to study in Hong Kong. The school has more requirements for the national security education course. There is a small job in the film, two or three weeks, and the final exam. In order to prepare for the exam, he and his classmates organized notes. Put a common pen document organized by Gavin and classmates before the test, which is full of discussions related to the history of the History of the People's Republic of China, such as the "Chief Executive's status and judicial organs. "The development of the political system in Hong Kong should be gradual, but it cannot resist the goals of one country and two systems. It is necessary to serve the needs of one country, two systems, and not to cooperate with Western democratic standards to determine the direction of development." He remembered that he just finished the end of the National Security Education Period, "The last question of the exam is to talk about Li Zhiying, and the" National Security Law "is not traced back to the past?" Ironically, Gavin saw "BBC" the day before the test. It is reported to discuss how the Hong Kong version of the National Security Law cracks down on freedom of speech. But the answer to the test papers tells him that this law traces of the past and do not mistake the law. "This lesson is ridiculous. Although it is not difficult to pass the exam, it is just passive and feels powerless. Why should we patriotism or understand the Chinese constitution? Most people around me should deal with it. For example, I know a International students, hold the Buddha's feet before the test, get a high score in the exam. "

Talking about the future, Tanya, who is currently working in Hong Kong Investment Bank, said that before studying in Hong Kong in 2016, it was believed that there was still a long time since Hong Kong's "one country, two systems remain unchanged for 50 years". Harbor has accumulated experience for several years, it should be fine. However, after participating in the delivery of the Central Movement, she decided to leave Hong Kong earlier than the original plan: "Seriously, staying in Hong Kong for a long time, has feelings for Hong Kong, but Hong Kong's political environment is turbulent, there is no way (because I like Hong Kong) Special stay. "However, more reasonable analysis of students in Hong Kong and Taiwan how to make good use of the resources that can be obtained in Hong Kong will increase the guarantee of their career development or further studies. For example, Elaine, Belle and others from the Institute of Technology considers going to the European and American Institutes to upgrade. Even if they are disgusted with the National Security Education Course, EDGAR, Gavin, and Daniel who are studying in business schools still plan to stay in Hong Kong in the future, the main reason is that "more money can be stored in Hong Kong is more than Taiwan." Among them, Edgar and Gavin both hoped to obtain permanent residence permits, nor did they oppose Taiwan high school students to study in Hong Kong. Gavin said, "It is worth developing and studying in Hong Kong, but the sacrifice should be sacrificed, as if you can't speak freely or have no freedom. Anyway, you can't talk about it in Hong Kong, just go back to Taiwan." It is recommended that students go to Hong Kong to consider carefully, especially the field of humanities and social sciences. "Their talents are being lost and their advantages are also declining. It may be better to study a master's class in Taiwan first, and then apply for (European and American universities), because foreign schools will also worry about Hong Kong universities and The assessment of the university will also decline, because their teachers are lost because of the National Security Law. The teacher is not just the loss of talents. After the professor from China, the stance of the things will be completely different from the route. "After the Guoan Education Course quietly entered the campus, how long can the academic autonomy of the Hong Kong colleges and universities be maintained? No one is accurate. The choice of career development and freedom of speeches is left to every Taiwanese student who will consider going to Hong Kong in the future.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T10-08-43-08-00/00SONAM-01-fmph-master1050.jpg)In the winter of 1982, Bu Qiongsonan(Bhuchaungsonam)After leaving home in central Tibet, he trek with his father for five days and crossed the Himalayas to Nepal. At that time, he was only about 11 years old, and he hardly knew why they had escaped -China had decades of colonial rule for his hometown -nor did he not realize that he had left his homeland forever, and his mother and six brothers and sisters.

After arriving in Nepal, Bu Qiongsinan and his father went to a Buddhist sacred place in neighboring countries India, where the Dalai Lama and many exile Tibetans were residents. His father returned to Tibet without much explanation, leaving Bu Qiongsonnan, and was taken care of by a friend of his family.

Bu Qiongson has never seen his father since then, because his father died in his second year of high school. The last time he talked to his mother nine years ago. In that short call, the mother promised: "We will meet again." But Bu Qiongsinan already knew at that time that the political status of Tibet made it almost impossible to meet.

He said that everything is fresh in a foreign country without relatives: bananas, bean paste, and famous Indian monsoon. Writing and literature have become spiritual and sophisticated recipes that help him continue to survive after losing his homeland and his family. "Writing is painful," he said. "It is a process of negotiating the extremely harsh and endless obstacles and challenges brought by exile."

He became a writer and editor who published nine episodes and selection. But it can be said that his more important contribution to literature is to edit and publishers of TibetWrites, which is a publishing house and online platform for Tibetans. Today, TibetWrites and its publishing branch Blackneck have been published 20 years ago. More than 50 books have been published, which has become a push for a small scale of Tibetan humanistic ecosystems.

As the Chinese government continues to suppress Tibet, [detention](https://savetibet.org/tibetan-intellectuals-and-writers-detained-in-recent-spate/)Many Tibetans, Tibetan writers and intellectuals, said that Buqiongsonan's publishing house provides a feeling of homeless groups that deal with exile life, making literature a substitute for the nation -state.

"I can't live on the land of Tibet," the writer and editor Dan Zeng Diki(Tenzin Dickie)"But I can live in Tibetan literature."

The idea of founding TibetWrites began in 2003. After working for a period of time in a publishing house in Delhi, Bu Qiongsonan returned to Dallanala, India, and Dan Zengzhuzhu with writers and activists(Tenzintsundue)Established contact. Like Bu Qiongsonan, Dan Zengzhuzhu is also worried about the limited publishing channels of Tibetan writers, especially the lack of ways to publish Tibetan secular literature in English. At that time, Bu Qiongsonan was editing "Exile Muse"(Old Demons, New Deities)He believes this is the first Tibetan poem selection in English. But that's just a selection. He wants to do more for cultivating Tibetan literary traditions.

For more than a thousand years, Tibetan literature has always regarded Buddhism's pursuit of enlightenment as a center, and Diki believes that this is the opposite of the novel. In the preface of the selection of "Old Devil and New God" edited by her editor, Diki wrote that "the ideal of Buddhism has always eliminated desire", and "novels start from desire."

Those who engage in writing in Tibet need to bypass the restrictions of the censorship system, and the publications operated by the Tibetans in India mainly focus on Buddhism, history, and politics. Bu Qionenan feels that Tibetan writers living in the West need to work hard to handle the problem of flattening the Tibetans' experience in the focus of the spiritual world. He believes that Tibetan editors can provide the best help for Tibetan writers to create their own voice and emotions.

Except for a short -lived literature magazine founded by Tibetan students from the University of Delhi at the end of the 1970s, Tibetan writers have almost no way to publish works with the theme of ordinary people's life experience, especially the experience of exile Tibetans.

Buqiongsonan, Danzeng Zunzhu, and another founder decided to create an online platform for writers from Tibet and overseas overseas. After careful consideration, they named the company "TibetWrites". Bu Qiongsinan said that the declaration of this declaration requires the world to "first treat Tibetans as people".

Bu Qiongso Nan and Dan Zengzhu's cooperation thrive. Within a few years, they started publishing their own books with the brand of Blackneck. Bu Qiongsinan is the one with a quieter personality and a gentle speech among the two. He is responsible for editing. Dan Zengzhu is even more blunt, and he is responsible for marketing. Dan Zeng Zunzhu, wearing a red scarf on his head, vowed that he would not remove the scarf before Tibet got rid of Chinese rule.

Their published books include the third -generation exile Tibetan Kaisang(Kaysang)The feminist collection "Broken Portrait"(BrokenPortraits)And about the "Wangdu Diary" that Tibetan government officials visited Tibet in 1980(Wangdu’s Diary)Essence

Both Bu Qiongso Nan and Dan Zengzhu are working at home, and they are working free. Until a few years ago, due to the very few budgets of TibetWrites, the cost of printing books has been borne by the writer. Their returns are publishing platforms and advertising.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T10-08-43-08-00/00SONAM-02-fmph-master1050.jpg)"We have to keep Tibet as a concept and strengthen it," Bu Qiongsonan said, "And this is what art does this."

In addition to publishing the original works written by Tibetans in English, Bu Qiongsonan also translated Tibetan works into English. Last year, his translation won the Ostana Award in Italy, which aims to recognize writers who help protect the language and literature of ethnic minorities.

In the translation of the works of Tibetan writers, Bu Qiongsinan did not seek copyright permits. This is an unusual approach to have huge legal risks. He did this to avoid making the writer in danger. He said: If the Chinese government gets evidence of Tibetan writers and exiles or (in the words of the Chinese government), they may face prison disasters.

Scholar Shirley Boyer is "Resistance Mixed: New Tibetans of Exile Tibetans"(Resistant Hybridities: New Narratives of ExileTibet)The editor of the book, she praised Bu Qiongsonan's publishing house to help change the view of Tibet and Tibetan writers. "He let the world see that Tibetans are the writers of their own story," she said.

Boyer said that by publishing literature in Tibet in English, it has been widely spread among Tibetans living around the world (many of them do not know Tibetan). Among the people, it crosses the border and crosses the Himalayas. "Bu Qiongsonan's short story and poem collection "Blue Sky" edited in his editor(Under the Blue Skies)In the middle of the young Tibetan writer who lives in New York(Lugumawangje)After writing the story, a university publisher contacts the latter, hoping to use her work in a selection.

Although they have never seen each other, Bu Qiongso Nan encouraged Wang Jie and urged her to continue writing. "He is a mentor inspired me to write," Wan Jie said.

Whether TibetWrites will make writers success outside the field of Tibetan literature remains to be judged. However(Tseringyangzom Lama)Write in an email that her novel "We measure the Earth with the body"(We Measure the Earth With Our Bodies)The success shows that "readers are eager to see the Tibetan story", and this novel has been published by the Bloomsbury Publishing House last year. Diki will also be full of hope for the writer's career for the writer: "If not yet, it will definitely open up his career." It will definitely. "

advertise

Bu Qiongso Nan and Danzhen Zongzhi are also trying to correct the imbalance between Tibetan and Western languages. Many Tibetan works have been translated in the West, mainly Buddhist literature. Bu Qiongsinan said: "What we have, we all provide it to the world."

But there are very few Western works translated into Tibetan. He was trying to compensate and had begun to translate John Stanback's "Pearl" and Charles Dickens' "Great Future".

Unexpectedly, with the increase of TibetWrites and its readers, Bu Qiongsonan began to receive contributions from non -Tibetan writers, including India and Western writers. However, he still insisted that his publisher was specially published by Tibetan works, because Tibetans have hardly entered more mainstream publishing.

Tibetans in Tibet are also paying attention to his publishing house. Bu Qiongsonan said that a friend there told him that the writers were asking about the situation of exile writers, including the situation of Bu Qiongsonan himself. Knowing that his work is recognized in Tibet, he has firmly determined that he is committed to the inherent value of literature and the determination to make literature service for Tibet's self -determination movement.

"Before we found a political solution, we had to keep Tibet as a concept and strengthen it. Whether you call it a home or concept," he said. "This is what art does this."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T10-57-38/1-1689243052.png)Before Parliament voted to decide who will become the next Prime Minister of Thailand, Pitta Linjia Lunra will make a gesture when he arrives at the Thai Parliament (Agence France -Presse)

The far -end party where Pitta Lindela is located may win the most seats in the Thai election, but whether the 42 -year -old businessman can successfully become the next Prime Minister of this Southeast Asian country, it is far from determined.

The attractive far -sized party leader won in the election on May 14th and shocked the military elite of the Thai Emperor Party. He was the only candidate proposed by the Prime Minister of the Parliament Election on Thursday.

But he faced several obstacles.

Although the Eight -Party League of Pitta controls 312 seats in the newly elected House of Representatives, which is newly elected, he needs at least 376 votes to become the prime minister.

This is because the 250 Senate members appointed by the military after the coup in 2014 can also participate in voting. Many senators have stated that they will not vote for Pita, because his party boldly promises to weaken the Emperor's Army who has long -term dominant Thai politics. The power of power includes the monopoly of the law that has modified punishment and insulting monarchy, ending the monopoly of the recruitment and the wine industry.

Even though Pitta barely passed on Thursday's vote, he would face the problem of canceling the qualifications of the parliament, because the Thai Election Commission claimed that he held the shares of a media company and violated the election law.

On the eve of the key voting, the election agency filed a lawsuit with the Thai Constitution Court, which caused protests in the capital of Bangkok and cities across the country in the country. Political punishment.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T10-57-38/1-1689243109.jpg)Will the parent opposition be in power in Thailand?

Pitta arrived at the parliament before voting, and he told reporters that he "will do his best and live up to the hope and support that people give me."

"I will try my best to explain to those senators who still have questions. I will use this opportunity to reach a consensus."

#### Who is?

Colleagues and friends described Pitta's "modesty", "proficiency", and "happy compromise", and possess "the thoughts and spirit of being committed to public services in nature."

Peita was born in a family with a political background in Thailand in 1980. His friends call him Tim(Tim)He previously said that his interest in politics began in middle school in New Zealand.

Pitta is a "rebellious" boy who listens to rock and play guitar. His family "sent" him to "remote New Zealand". The only TV show where you can watch is Australia's soap drama or parliament debate. Earlier this year, He was interviewed in the Youtube show "AIM HOUR" in Thailand.

Pitta said he would spend his homework while listening to New Zealand's then Prime Minister Jim Bolg.

After returning to Thailand, Pitta completed a bachelor's degree in financial and banking at Bangkok University of France and Political Science, and then obtained a master's degree in business and public policies from MIT and Harvard University.

In his 20s, after Pita's father died, he took over the family business Agrifood as the CEO, according to his friend Jesus M. Akina(Jesus M Acuna)He said that although he was young, his leadership helped the company as one of Asia's largest rice bran oil producers.

Mexican lawyer Akana is a classmate of Pita in Harvard and a close friend who attended the Pita wedding in 2012. He said, "Pita's father represented the image of a typical strong leader in the company. In the drift, the company will disappear, so please remember that the young man was 25 years old at the time. He had to intervene. He could reverse the situation and let the company return to the right track and move towards success. This special challenge fully illustrates him. Ability."

Akana said that he has "the idea and spirit of being committed to public services" and "believes that the most important thing you can invest in a country is the people -prepare for them and provide them with tools to realize personal dreams. "

Pita appeared in politics for the first time in 2018. At that time, he joined the predecessor of the party's predecessor and the party in the future to handle his agricultural policy. He was first elected as a parliamentarian in 2019. He said that he has a "inertia in the system". New understanding.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T10-57-38/2-1689243163.jpg)Thai opposition crushed military political parties in the election

The legislator delivered a speech on the predicament of Thai farmers in the Parliament that year, which caused national attention for the first time. He said that the cost of agricultural production is high and leads to their debt.

Later in the same year, when the Thai Constitution Court dissolved "the future" and banned its leaders from participating in politics, Pitta and the party's remaining legislators formed a far party.

He described the nine years since the 2014 military coup (the army's second section since 2002) as Thailand's "lost ten years" and in an interview with the Thai public broadcasting company that the purpose of far away from the party is to "given Political Return of Thailand ".

Pitta said, "Our goal is to do things well. We are committed to decentralization of national power, monopoly economy, and national non -militaryization."

#### "Progress is not a straight line"

Recently, he was elected as the deputy speaker of the Thai Parliament.

Padpat Shunyda said, "He wants to change Thailand, not just to win quickly, but to change the Thai (governance) structure and change the country. Therefore, he really has a good understanding. And have enough courage to talk about in public (about Thailand). "

Padpart said that Pitta became an excellent leader is that he was willing to compromise and establishes the ability to connect with the younger generation and the older generation.

Padpart added, "He is really simple and humble. When we work together, we are like a team, working like a friend within the party."

The deputy leader of the Party Organization Silikia Tanzarkur described Pitta as "very skilled".

Silikia Tamkal told the Peninsula TV stations, "There are many problems very popular. Every time we discuss new problems, he will quickly conceptualize things and put forward solutions or suggestions. We can use it as a political party statement. Published effectively. "

His two colleagues also described Pita as the loving father of his seven -year -old daughter Piphm.

According to Thai English media "Examination English News"(Khaosod English)It is reported that Pita has the only monitoring right of this girl. Previously, he experienced a painful and fierce divorce storm. His ex -wife filed a lawsuit and accused him of abuse. The petition was rejected. Pita denied this. In an interview earlier this year, he said, "I have never had any domestic violence in my family" and he believes "the rights of women, families, children and politicians."Silikia added, "We must adjust our schedule for this. Sometimes, we must sometimes meet at a strange time, but because of his duties as a parent, he may not be able to participate.

In an interview with Peninsula TV in mid -June, Silikia said that she believes that Pitta can win the support of the Senate members.

She said, "With his humility and the quality of open compromises, he can win the votes of the Senate, and we hope to pass the difficulty."

Silikia said the party's focus was to mobilize its supporters.

"We must have someone standing on our side. This is why you see him meeting with supporters, voters and people in the inland provinces. I think this is how we deal with politics. We know that we are from the people, so we know that we are from the people, so we know We must maintain their support to win parliament. "

Pitta has always ruled out the possibility of amending the party's campaign to win the support of the Senate.

He said in AIM Hour in February's Youtube program, "Choose is to do its best and ensure that it will be achieved. Sooner or later, what happens to your control will happen, because you think you are standing on the right side of history. Then you always have motivation to continue. "

Pitta added, "progress is not a straight line ... it will not happen overnight."

(Voice of Germany Chinese website) If the economic trend does not continue to deteriorate, China's economic growth rate this year may be more than 5%, which is lower than the 6%of the previous international banks. Many signs show that after the end of the zero -zero -epidemic prevention policy, the economy [recovery](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338)Has lost the driving force: [Personal consumption](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/消费疲软-中国经济面临通缩风险/a-65868466)The downturn, weak exports, and pressure on the RMB exchange rate.

Data released by China Customs on Thursday showed that exports in June fell 12.4%year -on -year, a decrease of the largest since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic. Imports decreased by 6.8%, and imports and exports were significantly lower than the expectations of analysts. Among them, imports from South Korea fell 19%year -on -year from South Korea, and Reuters reported that this shows that China's demand for semiconductor and electrical components in South Korea continues to decline. The economic recession of European countries such as Germany has also led to a weak export of China.

What is particularly worrying is China [Real Estate Market](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/旺季不旺-中国楼市难脱困/a-66186726)Case. The real estate industry's contribution in China's GDP accounts for 25%. At present, many housing companies are struggling to survive, and the fear of investing in blood is spreading among buyers. As a result, Chinese companies and consumers now catch their wallets tightly, and they are unwilling to invest or consume.

According to financial experts in Barclays, China has fallen into a "difficulty in a shrinking atmosphere." [Tong shrinking](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国经济这边风景独自通缩/a-66181261)It means that prices generally fall, which leads to a spiral development that has declined in sales, wages and investment, and brings catastrophic consequences to the economy.

### "Asset -liability Tables Downsifying"

The current China is reminiscent of Japan in the 1990s. After the real estate bubble ruptured, the Japanese economy has fallen into a long -term crisis for more than ten years.

"Japan's commercial real estate prices fell 87%at the time," American economist Richardkoo recalled in an interview with Bloomberg. Over the years tightening the trouser belt to repay the debt, it is unable to invest.

Gu Chaoming is the chief economist of the Institute of Nomura Research. He worked in the Federal Reserve. In 2003, he published the book "Balance Sheet Recession".(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体中国正在步入失去的十年吗/a-66071490)"The Japanese economic crisis in the 1990s. He explained in the book that it was not due to the prosperity cycle, but the recession caused by the securities and real estate market bubbles, that is," the decline of the balance sheet ".

Right now, some economists and media of China are discussing it warmly whether China's economy is also going to the decline of the balance sheet. The influential media "Caixin" has repeatedly analyzed whether the theory of Gu Chaoming's theory has been comparable to the current status of the Chinese economy since June. In mid -June, Liu Lei, an expert in the National Assets Library Study at the National Financial and Development Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also called on the government to take stimulating measures to avoid the decline in balance sheets.

###  China will also "lose ten years"?

Gu Chaoming believes that the problems facing China are similar to Japan after the real estate bubble ruptured. Chinese companies and consumers reduce loans to repay debts, which will hinder economic development. He explained that reducing debt "is correct from an individual perspective, but if everyone saves expenses at the same time, it is a big problem for the national economy.

Economists at Capitaleconomics, a financial research institution in London, believes that the Chinese government will intervene from the level of economic and fiscal policy: "In view of the sluggish credit demand and the pressure of currency to withstand, we believe that support measures will mainly reflect fiscal policy as fiscal policy . The agency expects that the Bank of China will continue to cut interest rates this year. Hu Yuexiao, an analyst at Shanghai Securities, also expects that the central bank will reduce loan interest rates to stimulate demand.

However, Gu Chaoming believes that it is not enough to rely on interest rate cuts. The decision makers of Beijing must take all possible means to avoid repeating the mistakes of Japan. Specifically, he suggested investing funds and promoting a large number of pause real estate projects. "I would suggest that the Chinese government supports real estate companies to complete the planned construction projects. I think this is the most effective method of using taxpayer funds." Gu Chaoming said that this can make those who are suffering from extremely uneasy. Rest assured, "After all, they have paid the real estate or paid at least the down payment."

### Henan Rotten Tail House Project Endogenesis is difficult to collect

This seems to coincide with the idea of Chinese leadership. On Monday (July 10), the General Administration of the People's Bank of China and the Financial Supervision and Administration announced that it will be launched in 2022.

This may mean that the company has successfully got rid of its dependence on American chips and returned to the 5G mobile phone market with Chinese chips.

If Huawei successfully puts 5G mobile phones again, it will be a major victory for Huawei. Since the United States promulgated a chip ban on Huawei, the company has been in a difficult "survival model" in 2020. In recent years, the overall sales of Huawei mobile phones and telecommunications equipment have decreased significantly.

** The chip is blocked so that Huawei cannot compare with Samsung and Apple **

The United States, Canada and other countries have identified in recent years that the use of Huawei technology products will bring national security risks. However, Huawei denies related allegations. The United States began to implement a chip ban on Huawei during the Trump administration. Since then, Huawei can only sell a small amount of 5G mobile phones with the remaining European and American chips, and instead sells 4G mobile phones. Due to technical obstacles, Huawei, who has swept the international mobile phone market in the past or two years, has not been able to compete with Apple and Samsung mobile phones.

# US officials say that Chinese hackers attack the State Council and the Ministry of Commerce

Description: U.S. officials said that within a few weeks before Bollinger's visit to China, hackers may be affiliated with the Chinese military or spy department, attacking personal emails, but saying that there is no confidential email or cloud system that has been invaded. Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters US State Council's network security team first discovered the invasion of personal email accounts and issued alert to Microsoft.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T12-10-21-08-00/12dc-cyber-wcpf-master1050.jpg)U.S. officials said on Wednesday that during the few weeks before the Secretary of State Brillings visited Beijing in June, Chinese hackers tried to invade the specific email accounts of the US State Department and the Ministry of Commerce.

U.S. officials said the investigation of these Chinese hackers is underway, and these hackers may be affiliated with the Chinese military or spy department. However, U.S. officials faded the saying of hackers to steal sensitive information, insisting that there was no secret email or cloud system that was invaded. The network security team of the State Council first discovered the invasion.

Several officials said that the attack was aimed at personal email accounts, not Chinese hackers [suspected before](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/office-of-personnel-management-hackers-got-data-of-millions.html)Large -scale data leakage. Bayeng government officials refused to disclose which officials have become hackers' attack targets.

Microsoft announced this hacker operation on Tuesday. According to the company's survey, the hacker operation began in May. A U.S. official said that on June 16, the State Council discovered the invasion and notified Microsoft on the same day. It was before Brinken moved to Beijing. Brinken left Washington that night.

This visit is vital to Washington and Beijing: This is the first visit to China in the past five years in the United States Secretary of State, hoping to establish a high -level communication channel and improve the increasingly worse relationship. Since then, the Minister of Finance has visited Beijing; Climate Special Envoy Ceri will arrive in Beijing on Sunday for [four -day talks](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230707/john-kerry-china-climate/)Essence

In November last year, President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, and agreed to work hard [stable relationship](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/14/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)However, in early February, the Pentagon found that the Chinese spy balls floating over the United States and shot down. Since then, the tension between the two countries has intensified. During that incident, Brinken canceled his visit to China; a few weeks later, he publicly accused Beijing of considering providing military assistance to Russia for military assistance for the Ukrainian war.

A senior official of the State Council who was unwilling to be named, when discussing the sensitive incident, said that the beginning of the hacker attack has no direct relationship with Brinken's re -arrangement. Some officials warned the investigation of what materials (if.) The investigation of the hacker was still in the early stage.

In a statement of the State Council stated on Wednesday, after discovering the "abnormal activity", the government took measures to ensure the safety of the system and "will continue to surveillance and respond to any further activities."

According to a spokesman, after the State Council issued an alert to Microsoft on the vulnerability, Microsoft has begun to find other loopholes. After receiving the notice of Microsoft, the Ministry of Commerce learned that its email based on cloud technology has been invaded. The Ministry of Commerce has been leading the implementation of export control to prevent the Chinese military from obtaining key technologies of the United States, which has always been the most annoying move to Beijing.

After the State Council reported to Microsoft's hacking incident, the company found that these hackers also attacked about 25 organizations, including government agencies. An official of the US Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency said that some of them are overseas and the number of affected organizations in the United States does not exceed ten.

U.S. officials said hackers are only for several email accounts in each organization, rather than invasion of large -scale. However, neither US officials nor Microsoft disclosed the number of accounts that they might have been invaded by Chinese hackers.

The U.S. government has not officially blamed China in China, perhaps because the Bayeng government is trying to maintain negotiation with Beijing. However, U.S. officials said privately that they agreed that Microsoft blamed the hacking attack on China and said that the attack had the characteristics of complex attacks with government support.

U.S. officials compared these invasion to surgery, which was in sharp contrast to the SOLARWINDS hacker in 2019 and 2020. At that time, Russian intelligence agencies used the loopholes in the software supply chain to enter thousands of computer networks.

Spy agencies are usually very cautious when they invade the hostile network, trying to extract as much information as possible without being found.

The United States and China are in increasingly fierce intelligence competition, and both governments have tried to expand the scope of intelligence collection of each other. U.S. officials said that such spy activities and hackers are expected, and they are conducting a strong investigation to eliminate the vulnerabilities used by Chinese hackers and other potential security vulnerabilities in cloud computing.

On Wednesday, U.S. officials stated that the network security experts of the State Council found the invasion by carefully checking the email access log, which recorded the time when the email was hacked and invaded.

U.S. officials said Microsoft collects additional fees for regular access to these logs. Some entities affected by hackers do not have this access permissions, which means that without Microsoft's help, they cannot detect intrusion. U.S. officials have been urging Microsoft to provide access to all organizations that sign the cloud computing contract.

The State Council is often attacked by a foreign government. Russian intelligence agencies have repeatedly targeted the computer network of the State Council. In 2014 and 2015, Russian hackers invaded the joint meeting of the State Council, the Chief of Staff and the White House, as well as other important but non -confidential computer networks.

![](Images/cnnytimes/2023-07-13T12-21-12-08-00/11nkorea-cqpj-master1050.jpg)According to the official Korean media reports on Tuesday, North Korea threatened military operations on the American spy aircraft on the east coast of the country. At the same time, a U.S. submarine, which can launch nuclear ballistic missiles, plans to visit South Korea for the first time in 40 years.

North Korea is often angry with the US military reconnaissance activities around the Korean Peninsula. But since Monday, it has continuously issued three statements, threatening to retaliate against the so -called "provocative air spy activity" of US reconnaissance aircraft and drones.

On Monday, the North Korean Ministry of Defense accused a US strategic reconnaissance aircraft illegally invading the "invasion of leading" near its east coast this month.

According to the Chaozhong News Agency, "It is not guaranteed that it will not happen that a shocking accident like the US Air Force strategic reconnaissance aircraft is shot down."

In the two separate statements released on Tuesday and earlier on Tuesday, the sister and spokesman of North Korean leader Kim Jong -un, Kim Jong -un, also said that the US reconnaissance aircraft flew over the country's exclusive economic zone and "seriously infringed North Korea's sovereignty "And security". She warned that if this illegal invasion continues, "shocking" or "serious" incidents will occur. In 1969, North Korea shot down a US reconnaissance aircraft, causing all 31 people to be killed on the plane.

Both the Pentagon and the South Korean military have denied that North Korea's statement is not currently accusing. However, officials and analysts in the region are worried that North Korea's continuously upgraded remarks may lead to various military provocations.

The Pentagon said, "We have always carried out actions and safely in accordance with international law responsibility and safely." US State Council spokesman Matthew Miller urged North Korea to "do not upgrade its actions."

South Korea also countered North Korea's response. A South Korean military spokesman said on Tuesday: "North Korea puts forward these claims for domestic purposes, perhaps to make an excuse for launching a provocation." He pointed out that the exclusive economic zone guarantees the freedom of navigation and flight of foreign ships and aircraft.

According to the International Public Law, a country can advocate the right to develop its exclusive economic zone marine resources. This economic waters start from the width base line volume of the 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles. sovereignty.

North Korea usually upgrades anti -American remarks before the end of the anniversary of the Korean War on July 27 to strengthen the legitimacy of its nuclear weapon plan. In a statement, the North Korean Ministry of Defense severely criticized the Pentagon's decision to send a nuclear submarine to visit the South Korean port to visit the South Korean port. When President Biden met with South Korean President Yin Xiyue in April, the two sides agreed to strengthen the joint military exercises between the two countries.

On the occasion of North Korea, South Korean President Yin Xiyue was participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in Lithuania. It is expected that he will condemn North Korea's nuclear weapon development with the world leaders at the meeting. Before such international gatherings, North Korea usually becomes more provocative.

"This is not a normal court." After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Harvard's enrollment discrimination case, Biden turned around before going out at the press conference. In this sentence, more or less said the voice of the United States left.

Of course, the United States leftists understand that the Supreme Court of the conservatives accounted for two -thirds of seats cannot make many judgments they want. However, Biden's expectations for a "normal" court may not be high. After all, after the Corporation of Volon stepped down as chief in 1969, the ideology of the US Supreme Court has always tended to conservatives. However, the three major judges appointed by Trump have established an absolute majority of conservatives 6 to 3. Prior to this, when the US High Court faces major political problems and social problems, most of them will be cautious and cautiously to avoid the impact of judicial restraint or minimizing the judgment on political procedures and social life. This kind of restraint avoids the "conservative" attitude of the Supreme Court's politicization in recent years. After a series of major issues such as abortion, guns, environmental protection, and religion last year, after a series of major issues such as abortion, guns, environmental protection and religion At the end of June this year, the American High Court once again brought the gospel to conservatives, which also marked that the US High Court is no longer the onlookers of the "Cultural War", but adopted a more positive attitude to actively involve cultural politics. "The restraint turned to radical conservative.

The "cultural war" in the United States is simply a conflict between the right of the right (based on Christianity) traditionalism and conservativeism and the leftist's progressism and liberalism. This conflict is derived from the diversified political culture of the United States, and it is also a reflection of the polarization of politics. In recent years, the main battlefields of the Cultural War are concentrated on campus and parliamentary, and the left and right factions often use lawsuits to spread the "war" to court. Last year, the cases involving abortion and gun control were reflected in the conservative use of the Supreme Court to "win". However, in the American cultural war, the most important issue is race. Therefore, the most penetrating cases of cultural warfare are probably this year's Harvard enrollment discrimination case.

The focus of the Harvard admissions discrimination case is whether the American university can take the applicant's race as one of the admission considerations during the admission process. The conservatives of the US High Court are absolutely determined, and based on the influencing factor of race as admission, it violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.

This so-called "race" admission method is generally regarded as part of the "AFFIRMATIVEACTION". However, although the "equal rights policy" of Chinese translation is commonly used, it is not completely accurate. The source of this English phrase can be traced back to a presidential order issued by President Kennedy in 1961, asking government contractors to take "AFFIRMATIVEACTION" to eliminate employment discrimination. In the original context, "Affirmative" is not a proper noun. "Action" is "Action". Although "Affirmative" is the most common meaning, although it is "affirmative", it cannot be explained here because it must be an attitude, not actions. The generation of this phrase is probably due to the language habits of Kennedy's good use of multi -syllable "advanced" words. Therefore, here, "Affirmative" points to it more old and more common -"support", "affirmation", "enhancement", that is, the meaning of its roots. In this phrase and applicable context, "AFFIRMATIVE" is more accurate to "support" and "encouragement". Therefore, the Chinese translation as "support" may more accurately reflect the true "action" side of "AFFIRMATIVEACTION" in semantics: that is, in the process of college admission and workplace recruitment, active "support" in history is not treated in history. (Such as women or ethnic minorities), so that they can enjoy the same opportunities as non -vulnerable groups. In the history of the development of the US civil rights movement, especially the promotion of the civil rights movement and the affirmative bill of passing in the 1960s, the "Affirmative" became a proprietary term and was generally translated as a "equal rights policy".

Race -based "support" policy has always been controversial. Supporting one party often pays more attention to the results of the results. It is believed that because the disadvantaged group has been treated for a long time, it is impossible to require them to compete with non -vulnerable groups on the same starting line. Therefore The result of unfair competition caused by history. The opponents emphasize that the procedure is fair and believes that the essence of "support" is the destruction of the rules, and it is also a "reverse discrimination" of non -vulnerable groups. In addition, opponents will believe that "support" of vulnerable groups is not only long -term scores, but will deepen the dependence of vulnerable groups' dependence on "support" and the stereotypes of people's stereotypes on vulnerable groups.

The Rejects of the University of California v.bakke, which is judged by the University of California in 1978, is the first jurisprudence of the US High Court for the "support" and the biggest difference between the judges. A white student named AlanBakke applied for the University of California Davis Medical College, which has reserved a fixed place for ethnic minorities, has led him to apply for two consecutive years. All admitted ethnic minorities. At that time, the nine judges wrote six different opinions. The final compromise was reached by Judge Powell -allowing universities to consider the applicant’s Race, but prohibits fixed places for students of any race. The "support" policy was retained, and Bucky was admitted to the medical school as expected.

Powell's compromise attitude was recognized and strengthened in the Grutter V. Bollinger in 2003. Most of the opinions of the main author of the judges of the judges of the Great Avnie have recognized the reason for increasing the "diversity" of campus as "supporting", but also mentioned that considering that races cannot be used to deepen improper stereotypes, nor can they be used as "admission" admission " Reduce points ". Overnor also mentioned that after 25 years, this race -based preference is no longer necessary to increase the diversification of campus. This 25 -year -old comment may be just an inadvertent speculation, but the result has become an important reason why the Supreme Court in Harvard's enrollment discrimination has ended the "support operation".In the 237 -page judgment on the official website of the US High Court, most of Roberts's opinions accounted for only 40 pages of them. The coordinated opinion of the former Judge Thomas and the opposition of Judge Sodomary's opposition to the Liberal Liberal Master far exceeded the length of most opinions -the confrontation of the language and opinions of the two parties directly reflects the judgment as a cultural war. The nature. Of course, from the beginning, this case has a strong smell of the cultural war. The plaintiff in this case is "Studentsfor fair admissions (Inc." ("SFFA"). Edwardblum, the initiator of this organization, is a right political activist. His so -called "fair admission" is to oppose "support". This judgment was actually two cases in one case, one was SFFA's Harvard Academy of Sciences, and the other was the University of Karolina, the University of SFFA. SFFA was sued Harvard as early as 2014. However, the preliminary trial of the Federal Court of Massachusetts and the appeal of the Federal First Circuit Court defeated, because the underlying court did not deny the "support" in accordance with the principle of "follow the precedent". However, after the plaintiff and the defendant in October in October last year, they were verbal in the US High Court, and people could already guess how they would vote from the questions of various judges.

In the cultural war in the United States, "discrimination" has always been the basis for the argument of minority and vulnerable groups -because of the atmosphere of "political correctness", it is difficult for people to put forward the view of "minority discrimination against whites" and Attack it. As one of the ethnic minorities, Asian people, SFFA can cleverly discriminate against Asians in the name of "supporting action" and propose the argument that white people are discriminated against by ethnic minorities -it can be described as "the way of their own people, but also governs their people's people’s way. body".

In addition, the other purpose of SFFA (also known as contributions) is to show the public the admission process of Harvard and some other famous American universities through evidence of American civil lawsuits. Prior to this, the admission system of Harvard Academy was like a black box and was not known by outsiders. However, due to the need to respond, Harvard had to disclose the admission process of undergraduates. The majority of Roberts' opinions also summarized it:

For each application, Harvard will let an admissions officer read through, and scores the six projects of academic, extracurricular, sports, school support for applicants, individuals and comprehensive projects. The scores of each item are divided into six gear, the one is the highest, and the 6 points are the lowest. In the first round of rating, the admissions officer generally considers the applicant's race. Previously, it was reported that the "individual" score of Asian applicants was generally beaten by Harvard admissions officers than other ethnic groups. After that, each admission group divided by geographical areas evaluates three to five days of applicants in the area, and recommends some applicants to the General Admissions Committee. These admission groups will also consider the applicant's race.

The next step is to vote for each applicant and generate a tentative admission list for each applicant. The General Admissions Committee considers the proportion of students from each race every year, and will intentionally ensure that the proportion of African and Spanish students will not decrease significantly compared with the previous year. After the tentative admission list comes out, the 40 -person committee will count the proportion of various races.

The last step is the "brush", that is, further reduces the quota on the tentative list (because applicants who meet the Harvard admission standards are far more than the number of new students that Harvard can accommodate). When the "brush", the admissions officer only considers four information, namely inheriting identity (that is, whether parents or other relatives are alumni), special recruitment athlete identity, qualifications for learning funds (related to family income), and race. Roberts also mentioned that race played a decisive role in the admission of large proportion of African and Spanish descent.

If races are "bonus" to African and Spanish descent, in the process of "brushing people", the races of Asians and white people will become "subtraction" -s violated the rules established by the Grurt case Essence Of course, this is not to say that Harvard will recruit non -standard African and Spanish students due to "supporting policy". After all, the most basic and critical standard for enrollment of prestigious schools is to ensure that the admitted students can complete the challenging of challenging students. Curriculum. Therefore, the beneficiaries of the "support policy" are only a few African -American, Spanish and indigenous students who have reached the standards of Harvard and other small elite colleges, rather than the underdeveloped public education system in the United States. Middle has long been "delayed" vulnerable groups.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T12-38-03/1-1689251587.png)After the NATO Summit, Biden delivered a speech at the University of Vernis (Gaidi image)

He can satisfy all parties and keep the alliance solidarity. He also got what he thought. This is the results of the NATO summit held in the Lithuanian capital of Vernis, the US President Joe Bayeng. Very powerful, not only limited to citizens of NATO countries, but also conveyed US information to the world.

The most prominent achievements of Biden and the entire NATO summit are that after the Bayeng government's "behind -the -scenes diplomacy" in the capital of the European countries and the US Congress, Turkey suddenly changed its position against Sweden as the 32nd member states in NATO.

Biden can use his success-the expansion of NATO after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine War-as part of the upcoming presidential presidential campaign of political heritage, his long-term experience in Congress may soften and change the members of the parliament to be with Turkey F-16 Position on fighter problems.

Biden chose the former Republican Senator Jeff Flek as the Ambassador to Ankara. This is the key to overcoming Congress's concerns about selling advanced F-16 fighters to Turkey, and it is also part of Turkish change to Sweden to join the NATO position.

When Biden arrived at the summit, he was determined to maintain a balance, that is, strengthening the West's support for the conflict of Ukraine, and avoiding war with Russia in the nuclear power. He also needs to remind Americans why the taxpayer's billions of dollars should continue to be sent to Kiev? This is a problem for the presidential campaign in 2024.

Biden successfully played a role in participating in the permanent supply of weapons in Ukraine in the future, as an innovative solution that meets its future needs, and at the same time overcomes the limitations between Kiev and NATO.

#### Ukraine benefits

On the other hand, although the Ukrainian President Zelei Sky actively attacked NATO countries in determining the clear timetable of Ukraine to join the alliance, he eventually won the promise of the Seven State and the stable mechanism of the future reorganization of military reserve.

Although President Ukraine came to the summit as an angry guest, at the end of the summit, he made an impressive remark to President Biden, for example, "You spend this money on our lives, I think you are saving your life for Europe and the world. "

After arriving at the summit, Zeleiski criticized NATO countries to refuse to provide Ukraine to join the alliance timetable as "ridiculous", but Biden insisted that the qualifications to NATO membership will now mean that NATO countries will have to fight against Russia. Avoid catastrophic upgrades.

At the end of the NATO Summit, the leaders of the Seventh Kingdom Group issued a joint statement that promised to make long -term bilateral security commitments to Ukraine to strengthen its land, sea and air defense to prevent Russia from attacks in the future.

This measure aims to guide Ukraine to the future. When it can truly join NATO and benefit from Article 5, Article 5 provides a protective umbrella for the common defense between its member states.

#### Weaken Russia and warn China

Sweden joined the NATO agreement and the long -term support for the Seventh Kingdoms Group has weakened Russia's strategic position. However, the threat to the war against Moscow, including its nuclear arsenal, still weakened the willingness Essence

Biden also urged the NATO countries to ask China not to support Russia's war in Ukraine in any way, and emphasized that the deep partnership between Beijing and Moscow runs counter to the values of NATO.

NATO issued a statement saying that "China's ambitions and coercion policies challenge NATO's interests, security and value."

In this lengthy statement, NATO member states said: "The deep strategic partnership between China and Russia, as well as their mutually reinforcement of rules -based international order attempts, run counter to our values and interests."

The statement said, "We call on China to play a constructive role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, condemn the war of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and do not support Russia's war efforts in any way, stop magnifying Russia to blame the Russian invasion of the Ukrainian war in Ukraine and NATO The false narrative, comply with the purpose and principles of the UN Charter.

(Voice of Germany Chinese) According to Reuters quoted research institutions, China Huawei Technology Co., Ltd. is planning to return to the 5G smartphone industry by the end of this year, which marks that Huawei has issued a ban in the US government to weaken its consumer electronics business It may come back later.

### Huawei, SMIC

The third -party technology research company focusing on the Chinese smartphone industry told Reuters that Huawei should be able to use its progress in semiconductor design tools, as well as SMIC(Minimum wage)The company's production and manufacturing purchase 5G chips in China.

These companies quoted industry sources, including Huawei suppliers, claimed that they were unwilling to disclose their names because they had a confidentiality agreement with customers.

Huawei rejected Reuters' comment requirements. SMIC did not respond.

### Huawei's sense of crisis

Huawei has been struggling in the "survival" model in the past three years. Returning to the 5G mobile phone market will marked Huawei's victory. Huawei consumer business revenue reached its peak in 2020, with a peak of 483 billion yuan (about $ 67 billion), plunging nearly 50%a year later.

This technology giant headquartered in Shenzhen once competed with Apple and Samsung to compete for the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/华为再受打击-被多家行业标准协会暂时除名/a-48873457)Cover the channels for the chip manufacturing tools necessary for the most advanced model.

In May 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that [to prevent supply chips from Huawei globally](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/收紧制裁-美国能否对华为一剑封喉/a-53479061)Essence After three months, [plus order to block Huawei](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/美国加码封杀华为-38子公司列黑名单/a-54603254)It is required that semiconductor manufacturers, including US technology and software research and development, must be permitted by the US government in order to supply Huawei and their suppliers. The purpose of this move is to prevent Huawei from using third parties to obtain American chips.

The United States and the European governments later said that Huawei had security risks, but Huawei denied this allegations. Since then, Huawei has only used inventory chips to sell limited batch 5G models.

According to the data from Consulting Company Canalys, although Huawei's market share in China in the first quarter of this year rose to 10%, Huawei was still selling previous generation 4G mobile phones. Last year, Huawei ranked on the global mobile phone sales list to the bottom.

### Huawei 5G mobile phone future

A research company told Reuters that Huawei is expected to use SMIC's N+1 manufacturing process. However, as the good product rate of the available chip is expected to be less than 50%, the shipment of 5G equipment will be limited to about 2 million to 4 million units. Another company is expected to ship 10 million units, but no more details are provided.

According to Canalys data, Huawei's shipping volume in the global smartphone market in 2019 reached 240.6 million units, which is the year of its highest shipments.

China Securities Journal, which has the national background, reported that Huawei has raised the target of mobile phone shipments in 2023 from 30 million units at the beginning of the year to 40 million, but did not mention the news of returning to the 5G mobile phone market.

Today, the above three research companies claim that Huawei may produce a 5G version of flagship models this year, such as iPhone's competitors P60, and new machines can be pushed out in early 2014. The research company said that their prediction was based on the information after verification with the Huawei supply chain and the company's recent announcement.

However, [US restrictions on the United States cut off the connection between Huawei and Google's Android operating system and most Android applications dependent developers' services](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/google部分停止与华为合作-新手机变残废/a-48799519), Limited the attractiveness of Huawei's mobile phone in outside China.

###  Improve old devices to make new chips

These research companies pointed out that Huawei announced in March in electronic design automation(EDA)The tools have made breakthroughs, and these tools are suitable for technology production of chips above 14 nanometers.

The chip design company uses EDA software to make a blueprint for chip, and then produces in batches in the wafer plant.

The research company quoted its own industry sources that Huawei's EDA software can be used with SMIC's N+1 manufacturing process to create chips equivalent to 7 nanometers. This powerful semiconductor is usually used for 5G mobile phones.

Washington prohibits [SMIC obtains an advanced chip manufacturing equipment called EUV from ASML. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/打擊中國芯片產業-美國施壓asml擴大出口禁令/a-62377061)This device is very important in the process of manufacturing 7nm chips.

However, some analysts have found that there are signs that SMIC has successfully produced 7 -nanometer chips by adjusting lower -level DUV devices, and SMIC can still buy this device from ASML.

Another research company said it noticed that Huawei had asked SMIC to produce chip components below 14 nanometer this year.

Dougfuller, a chip expert at Copenhagen Business School, said that less than 50%of the good product rate means that the 5G chip independently produced by Huawei "will cost high." "I think Huawei is willing to bear cost, they can do this, but I think this chip is not competitive in price."(Reuters)

Julianne Smith, a US ambassador to NATO, stated that NATO would not expand eastward to the Indo -Pacific region.

The two -day Vilnis NATO Leaders' Summit just ended, and the US Ambassador to NATO Smith on Wednesday (July 12) said in an interview with VOA during the summit that the United States defined the boundaries between NATO and Indo -Pacific regions. The "tailor -made partnership project" was launched with the Indo -Pacific Allies; and NATO's attention to China's challenges in the region did not mean that the alliance intends to invite Asian countries to join.

"We are breaking the obstacles between the Atlantic alliances and the Pacific allies in the United States in order to cope with the common challenges of network security, emerging and subversive technology, and maritime security. Any country in the Indo -Pacific region is officially included in the league. "

She pointed out that the initiative of NATO and Japan's "individual targeted partnership plan" (ITPP) initiative is an example of deepening partnership with India.

Japanese Prime Minister Kishita Kishita said on Wednesday that cooperation will surpass the traditional security field, and then expand to the fields of networks, emerging and disruptive technologies and strategic communication. He and NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg made a speech saying that the new arrangement was a response to challenging the international security environment.

According to earlier reports, NATO plans to set up offices in Tokyo in 2024 as a cooperation hub in NATO and South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. However, Kishida Wenxiong stated that Japan did not plan to become a "member or half member" in NATO.

This concept of NATO has aroused opposition from France in member states. China also warns NATO not to "enter the Asia -Pacific".

Stoltenberg did not give up the idea of setting up a office in Tokyo, and said that the issue still needs to be discussed.

According to France Guangwang, when French President Macron attended the Vilnius Summit on Wednesday, France once again stated that France opposed NATO's idea of setting up office in Tokyo. He emphasized that geographical concepts exist objectively. NATO should be the North Atlantic Convention. The Indo -Pacific region does not belong to the North Atlantic, and NATO has no mission in the Asia -Pacific region.

Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 13th) According to yesterday's peer review research, Google's artificial intelligence (AI) medical chat robot is in the difficulty of the highly difficult American USMLE qualification examination, but its answer is still far away Not as good as a human physician.

![](Images/rficn/2023-07-13T13-02-07-00-00/000000.png)Last year, Chat GPT was developed and listed by OpenAI, funded by Google's competitors Microsoft (Microsoft), to start the competition for the rapid development of science and technology giants in the field of rapid development of artificial intelligence.

Although the possibility and danger of the future of artificial intelligence have caused widespread discussion, this technology has demonstrated specific progress in the field of health, including interpretation of certain medical scans like humans.

In December last year, Google first showed the artificial intelligence tool MED-PALM in the pre-printed book in academics. Unlike Chat GPT, Google has not been announced in the public.

The American technology giant said that MED-PALM is the first large language model to pass the American physician license qualification examination (USMLE). The artificial intelligence technology of this model is generated by a large number of human-generated text training.

The subjects of this test were American medical students and trainers, and the score was about 60 points.

In February, a study pointed out that Chat GPT has reached the result of passing or near pass.

In the review research published in Journal Nature yesterday, Google researchers said that MED-PALM scored 67.6 points in the choice questions with USMMLE qualification examination style.

The study wrote: "MED-PALM's performance is encouraged, but it is still worse than clinicians."

In order to identify and reduce the "illusion" (for the situation that provides error information for AI models), Google said that it has developed a new set of evaluation indicators.

Google researchers and the main author of this new research report Karansinghal told AFP that the team has used this set of evaluation indicators to test their new version models and has achieved "very exciting" results.

A study published in the pre-print book published in May pointed out that MED-PALM 2 scored 86.5 points in the USMLE qualification examination, which was nearly 20%higher than the previous version.

Jamesdavenport, a computer scientist of the University of Bath, who did not participate in the study, said these artificial intelligence medical chat robots are facing a tricky issue, "but people deliberately ignore it."

He said that there is a big difference in the memory of "medical problems and actual medicine". Medicine actually includes diagnosis and treatment of real health issues.

Anthonycohn, an artificial intelligence expert, said: "Illustration will always be a matter of these large language models because they have the statistical essence."

Therefore, Kun pointed out: "These models should always be regarded as auxiliary tools, not the final decision maker."

When Bell Berk attended the NATO summit the day before, "the lesson brought by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is to reduce the one -sided dependence of foreign relations."

Germany is the country with the most investment in China in Europe, including automobiles and chemicals.

In response to the new Chinese strategy in Germany, the Chinese Embassy in Germany issued a statement saying that this measure based on ideological prejudice and competitive anxiety reduced risks will only bring counter -effects and artificially strengthen risks.

The statement of the Chinese embassy also said, "Practical cooperation in Germany and China in different fields such as economy and trade is mutual benefit and complementarity, and bring greater progress, and should not strengthen their respective risks."

In order to ensure the power supply of power, Zhejiang, a major manufacturing province in China, recently used the historical high consumption. In order to ensure the supply of electricity, the Zhejiang Provincial Government guided more than 7,000 enterprises to use electricity to use electricity and transferred to the night and resting day to produce. However, due to the decline in China's economy, most companies are in a state of unsaturated production, and they are currently not limited.

According to Surging News, Zhejiang Electric Power Company pointed out that from July 1st to 10th, Zhejiang Province's electricity consumption was 21.3 billion kilowatts, an annual increase of 10.5%. In order to ensure power supply, Zhejiang guided enterprises to actively produce.

On the 3rd of Zhejiang, the electricity consumption exceeded 100 million kilowatts, hitting a record high, 8 days earlier than last year. This is the earliest stage of peak in the history of Zhejiang Power Grid.

According to the CCP, the overall demand for the high energy consumption industry such as polyester, printing and dyeing, and fiber in Zhejiang has been weak in the past two years, and other high -energy consumption industries such as papermaking and building materials have not improved significantly.

Due to the deterioration of production profits, most enterprises are in unsaturated production status, and peak production has little impact. At present, Zhejiang Province has not yet issued a formal power limit notice.

Some trainees revealed that because of "discipline requirements", party members did not allow party members to make statements that contrary party will.

According to the Central News Agency, Yu Jianzhang said in an article entitled "Let's Disposter", saying that the student said that as a leading cadre of party members, it is absolutely not allowed to publish in front of the people outside the party. The remarks are not allowed to make the opposite remarks among the party members in the party. These words shocked him and felt sad.

Yu Jianzheng said that the classroom should not be just a stage for professor performance, and it should be a place for communication. Leading cadres at all levels should have confidence.

(Voice of Germany) [The "Chinese Strategy" of the German Government is finally released today](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国政府推出对华战略合作但减少依赖/a-66221218)Is this long -discussed document matches the expectations of the outside world? Or is there a gap? The comments published in "Focus Magazine" pointed out through the title: "Belbak bluntly talks about China -but let relevant people confused."

At the beginning of the article, when Belbak introduced Germany's "China Strategy" at the Merics Research Center (Merics), although she maintained a consistent tough attitude towards China, such as mentioning concerns about the forced labor of Xinjiang Uighurs, It does not support Beijing to attack democratic island countries, etc., but still cannot see that "Germany intends to prevent aggressive and prepare for war."

The author pointed out that unlike neighboring France, "When we listen to Berbak's speech, we will understand that Germany attaches unity by European partners. Because she mentioned" Germany "or" German economy ", she They will immediately mention "Europe" and "Europeans". [In contrast, French President Macron had already said that the Taiwan issue has nothing to do with France. ](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/马克龙的战略自主被批孤立自己削弱欧洲/a-65269516)The article continues to write: "From her explanation of the difference between" going risks "and" decoupling ", there is almost no help, you can see how difficult the coordination here is. It is not helpful, because no one is interested in the completely decourse of the two economies, especially those companies that continue to make big money in China.

"For Foreign Minister," de -risk "represents the potential risks of (German) companies must bear the (with China) in the future. Therefore, if the expected goods are not fulfilled, the German government will not intervene in providing emergency assistance. Belbak explained her colleagues with her party- [German Economic Minister Habeck has already introduced the content of the economy](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国经济部长面对中国要更加谨慎/a-63742487)Essence "

At the end of the article, the author mentioned that NATO President Stoltenberg's speech at the NATO Summit in the Vilnius, that is, China now threatened European security to compare the title of "fog". The author believes that Stoltenberg's expression here is more clear than Belbak. The comments finally wrote: "In the end, it is impossible to keep a distance from China even today, so that all participants, including German companies, know the future development trend."

The article "Why is the Chinese rulers afraid of the LGBTQ movement" in the "New Zurich" with the story of young people in China as the background to analyze why China's ruling authorities have increased the suppression of the LGBTQ group. The article mentioned that in recent years, the space of LGBTQ people in China has been greatly limited, and the 2020 "Shanghai Pride Festival" suddenly announced the permanent suspension and [Beijing Comrade Center in May this year's "force resistance" termination operation](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/北京同志中心宣布停運-中國lgbtq運動何去何從/a-65632979)For example.

The author wrote that in China, "in daily life, as long as it is not organized or put forward political requirements, LGBTQ people can still show their sexual orientation relatively openly." However, "Chinese rulers are now unwilling to see any form of civil society participating in any form of civic society, because the Chinese government is worried that this may lead to a wider political movement. Xi Jinping now hopes to kill the LGBTQ field as soon as possible as soon as possible Possible institutionalization, for Chinese authoritarian leaders, groups with different sexual orientation are obviously hidden dangers of national security. "

In addition to suppressing LGBTQ, the article criticizes that the outdated world view of many rulers is also worrying. The author pointed out that, for example, "in Xi Jinping's recognition, men must have" masculine qi ", and women's primary tasks are to have children for their motherland. In recent years, the Chinese authorities have taken action on the so -called" girls "boys. These feminine boys are very popular on TV and the Internet, but they are also banned because of this characteristics. "

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T14-13-11/1-1689256713.png)NATO national leaders reiterated to provide long -term support to Kiev at the end of the Lithuanian Summit (Peninsula TV)

The hopes of Ukraine President Vladimir Zellezki are the opposite. At the end of the NATO summit, Ukraine did not become a member of NATO, but the Ukrainian issue was still the main issue of the NATO Summit.

What did Ukraine get from the NATO Summit? The beginning of Zellezki's speech was frustrated and dissatisfied, what was the reason?

The US "VOX" website published a [Report] entitled "Ukraine at the NATO Summit" [Report](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/7/12/23784649/nato-summit-ukraine-biden-zelenskyy-vilnius)China emphasized that Kiev sought a clear timetable for joining NATO before the summit, rather than NATO vaguely promised that one day Ukraine would be qualified for NATO members.

Kiev's approach has been supported by some NATO member states, including some Eastern European countries, but other countries -including the United States and Germany -in an unknown war, it has made any specific specific to NATO issues to join NATO issues. Promise to be cautious, because this may cause NATO to fall into a direct conflict with Russia.

This cautious approach eventually won. The summit closing statement stated that the consent of the allies agreed that Ukraine was possible to join NATO, but it was not clarified or specifically explained. In addition to the war in Russia, the specific conditions also include political and legal reforms.

Since NATO member states do not agree to incorporate Ukraine into the alliance, what gains did Kiev from getting from the NATO Summit?

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T14-13-11/1-1689256872.jpg)The differences in Ukraine's joining NATO reflect the differences since the outbreak of the war(AFP)
####  Cancellation of a member states action plan

During the summit, NATO canceled the "Member State Action Plan" requirements for Ukraine -a series of formal standards that countries that wanted to join NATO -acknowledged that Ukraine made progress in the military and political goals of NATO.

NATO Secretary -General, Yanz Stoltenberg, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the cancellation of this action plan will change Ukraine's entry trajectory because this will become a step of one step rather than two steps.

#### Establishment of "NATO-Ukrainian Council"

The second harvest of Kiev at the NATO Summit was the establishment of the "NATO-Ukraine Council", which enabled Kiev to occupy a place on the negotiating table of all NATO member states and partners.

In a press conference, Stoltenberg said that this was a powerful step in Ukraine, and it was also a clear path to NATO.

However, the view of Ukraine President Zelenezki is different from Stoltenberg. He was sharp at the beginning of the summit and reflected a great sense of frustration. Unprecedented and absurd. "

Zelei Sky added, "It seems unwilling to invite Ukraine to join NATO, nor is he willing to make it a member of the alliance."

VOX news reports emphasized that Zediski acknowledged that NATO has not yet prepared to invite Ukraine to join, which is not wrong.

#### More support

According to VOX reports, the third harvest of Ukraine from the NATO Summit is that Kiev has received more promises to provide them with more weapons, including the long -range missile provided by France, which is an important step for Kiev. Although the Bayeon government agreed to provide a bundle bomb to Kiev last week to counterattack the Russian army, the United States has so far refused to provide Ukraine with a remote Army tactical missile system (ATACMS).

At the same time, the Seventh Kingdom Group (the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan) promised a long -term security commitment to Ukraine during a meeting during the NATO summit.

These commitments need to be further negotiated and may include military and economic assistance to Ukraine.

Including Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, many current and retired senior leaders of the Communist Party of China have sent wreaths, including Hu Jintao, Zhu Rongji, Wen Jiabao, Li Ruihuan, Li Keqiang, Wang Qishan, Liu Yunshan, Wang Zhaoguo, Deng Pufang, Sun Chunlan and Dai Bingguo. people.

Gao Yu, an independent media person in Beijing, revealed on Twitter that Xi Jinping, the highest leader of China, also sent a wreath, but the scene photos she posted on Twitter showed that someone was considered the wreath sent by Xi Jinping to block the signature in front of the wreath. This news cannot be confirmed from other channels.

She said on Twitter that the police arrived near her house at 6 o'clock on Thursday morning to prevent her from participating in Yan Mingfu's farewell style. Gao Yu emphasized that people mourned Yan Mingfu because during the Tiananmen Study Games in 1989, he faithfully implemented Zhao Ziyang's "solving the school movement on the road of democracy and legal system."

Yan Mingfu died on July 3 at the age of 92. He was the Russian translation of the former Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, and participated in the talks of Mao and then the General Secretary of the CPSU Nikitakhrushchev. Yan Mingfu's most commemorating the Chinese people is that during the 1989 Beijing Democratic Movement, he was the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Minister of the United Front Work Department. Essence However, after the June 4th incident, Yan Mingfu was also removed from office. He returned in 1991 and came back to the deputy minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Later, he served as the chairman of the Chinese Charity Federation. Regarding his death, the Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a report that he was a "loyal communist warrior."

** "Liu Xiaobo" in Central Park **

July 13th is also a commemorative day of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner and Chinese writer Liu Xiaobo. Liu Xiaobo is a participant in the Democratic Movement of the Tiananmen in 1989. He has long been committed to the system and concept of promoting democracy and freedom in China for a long time. He is one of the main drafters of Charter 08. Liu Xiaobo was arrested at the end of 2008 and was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting the crime of subverting the state power". In 2010, Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in prison.

Because of the long -term detained, Liu Xiaobo's body continued to deteriorate. During the medical treatment during the medical treatment on July 13, 2017, he died of liver cancer at the age of 61. He is also the only Nobel Prize winner in the history of the Nobel Prize in the history of the Nobel Prize.

In recent days, overseas has called for commemoration of Liu Xiaobo's voice. Many overseas democrats posted on social media such as Twitter to describe Liu Xiaobo's contribution to Chinese democracy.

The founder of the Human Rights Organization "Humanity China" and the leader of Tiananmen Xueyun Zhou Fengsuo posted on Tuesday (July 12) that "Humanitarian China" donated a bench named after "Liu Xiaobo" in the Central Park of New York to permanently permanent Commemorate him and call him a martyr of Liberty. The bench inscription is: "Expressing freedom, the foundation of human rights, the foundation of human nature, and the mother of truth."

Two days ago, Zhou Feng also sent a message saying that at 8 pm on Thursday, a candlelight commemorative meeting will be held at the Liu Xiaobo commemorative bench in New York Central Park on Thursday.

(Voice of Germany Chinese), AntonyBlinken, US Secretary of State, and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, Wang Yi met in the ASEAN meeting held in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The two of them appeared at the conference hall of a hotel in Jakarta and shook hands in front of the Chinese flags of China and the United States. The two subsequently held talks, but did not comment on the reporters present after the meeting.

US State Department spokesman Matthewmiller later told reporters that the meeting was "frank and constructive", "it is part of the continuous efforts to maintain open communication channels, which aims to show that the United States in a series of issues in a series of issues In interest, and by reducing the risks of misunderstandings and misjudgment, we will manage competition in a responsible manner. "

Agence France -Presse quoted a US official who was unwilling to be named. In the talks, Brinkee emphasized the necessity and urgency of the United States and China to restore military communication. He also warned hackers saying that the United States would take appropriate action against any actions against the US government, companies, and American citizens to investigate the responsibility of relevant responsible persons.

### Bringsken: I held an important talks with President Xi Jinping

### Qin Gang is absent due to health reasons

This is the second meeting of Brinken and Wang Yi within a month. [Brinken visited Beijing in mid -June](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/布林肯告诉习近平拜登认为美中有义务处理好关系/a-65956287)It became the first US Secretary of State who visited China in the past five years. He met Xi Jinping, President of China at the time, and Wang Yi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, and Qin Gang, foreign minister.

The ASEAN meeting was originally scheduled to be attended by Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. But the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that due to [Qin Gang's "Health Reason"](https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/秦刚去哪儿了北京健康原因缺席/a-66188018), Wang Yidai attended.

For a period of time, the relationship between the two largest economies of China and the United States has become increasingly tense because of a series of problems. These problems include China's increasing attitude in the Asia -Pacific region and the comprehensive restrictions on the implementation of advanced semiconductor exports in the Asia -Pacific region.

### Don’t spread red carpet, just give the red line

The trip to Beijing was the first visit to China in five years in the United States Secretary of State, and it was also the highest -level official to visit China after the Bayeng government came to power. However, when Brintken arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport, there were no red carpets, no one presented flowers, and the Chinese officials who were present at the scene were Yang Tao, the director of the North American Oceania, which was relatively low -level. Interestingly, there are still a few red lines on the ground floor, and the photos on the scene just captured the moment when Brincayan stepped on the "red line". As Sino -US relations are in a historic trough, all of this seems to be symbolic. However, some experts pointed out that except for Hillary Clinton as a Secretary of State's visit to China in 2012, when the Chinese side paved the red carpet for her, when the U.S. Secretary of State Cry, Tillerson, and Pompeo arrived in China, there was no red carpet in the apron, and there was no red carpet.

However, "News Network" broadcast by CCTV on the 18th did not report the matter. Regarding Brillin and Qin Gang's 6 or 7 hours of talks, the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency and others only reported the Chinese position that Qin Gang expressed with his teachings, but did not say anything. Xinhua News Agency said that Qin Gang said, "At present, Sino -US relations are at the lowest valley since the establishment of diplomatic relations", and emphasized that "the issue of Taiwan is the core of China's core interests", "it is also the most prominent risk."

The U.S. State Department issued a statement stating that Brintken emphasized the importance of maintaining smooth communication channels on both sides and proposed to cooperate with China on some issues, but at the same time, the United States will continue to protect the interests of Americans and safeguard the rules -based international order. The Wall Street Journal had previously analyzed that one of the driving force for the recent recovery of dialogue in the United States and China was the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to be held in San Francisco in November. Beijing hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the meeting and pave the way with US President Biden.

### Blinger to complete the main goal of this trip

According to usual, the US Secretary of State visits China, and Chinese leaders will meet with it. However, there are exceptions, such as when Plingken's former Pompeo visited China in October 2018, Xi Jinping did not see him. At that time, the Sino -US trade war had debuted, and US Vice President Pence had just delivered a tough speech on China. The relationship between the two sides was very tense. Today, Xi Jinping's visit to China after the Chinese balloon invaded the US led in the Great Hall of the People, which means that China and the United States will maintain high -level communication, and Brinken also reaches the "frankness, direct and direct, and directly, and directly announced by China to visit China. The main goal of constructive "discussion. During the talks, Xi Jinping was sitting in the middle, and the long tables on the left and right hands were sitting on Sino -US officials. Neither Xi Jinping and Brinken were wearing masks, and Qin Gang and Wang Yi, who had not wearing a mask during the meeting with Brinken, wore masks like other officials.

What you are listening to is the "Military Forbidden Area" column of Radio Free Asia. I am the host of the column. Talk about the latest progress of the Russian and Ukraine War today.

On July 12, the Russian and Ukraine War entered the 504th day. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces released the news that the two battles in 5 directions in 5 directions, and the fierce battle continued.

** Long -term anti -Russian **

The main force of the Russian army is concentrated in the direction of Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiyiyivka, and Maryinka. Kupanusk is located in the southeast of Halkov, northeast of Ukraine, 40 kilometers from the Ukraine border. Other directions are in Donetsk in southeastern Ukraine. From June 20th to the present, the two sides have offensive and defensive and tug -of -war.

The European political news website "Politico" pointed out on July 11 that according to an internal document drafted by the European Union's foreign department, it is recommended that the European Union will make a comprehensive "security commitment" to Russia in the next few years. The recommended content includes ensuring that it continues to transport weapons to Kiev, continue to carry out military education and training, share intelligence, and help Ukraine to connect to EU defense companies. At the same time, it is recommended that the European Union must provide "long -term and predictable financial support," so that Ukraine can rebuild homes.

This document wrote that the EU and Ukraine's firm solidarity and death were survived. Russia "cannot give up the goal of conquering Ukraine." Therefore, Ukraine needs the EU's long -term commitments and support to ensure the future of Europe's free and democracy. It seems that the European Union has long -term anti -Russia's psychological preparation.

As of now, although the Ukrainian counterattack has not been fully launched, it has shown an amazing combat power with a big fight, and the military application of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly high. "FoxNews" reported on July 7 that the Ukraine used custom artificial intelligence to gain advantages on the battlefield. They rely on the small elves and IT army (information technology army) to develop technology from scattered components.

Journalist in Ukraine, Brettvelicovich, told the Fox News Channel that the Ukraine's innovation on the battlefield, the US government and the Western government did not know what was happening, they did not keep up, " Develop too fast. "

** 25 ** ** 10,000 ** ** it ** ** Army **

Ukraine engineers spent only a few hundred dollars to complete all jobs in their garage or small elves. They are proficient in technology, which is impressive. After Russia's invasion, Ukraine recruited 250,000 personnel with certain technologies and was willing to help develop the equipment required by the equipment required for the development of technologies and repair war to form an information technology army and defend their homes. They quickly learn and grow under the fire.

The report pointed out that the Ukrainian IT army got feedback from the battlefield and knew what they needed. They quickly combined into various kits, such as the camera of the smartphone (iPhone) for identification, connecting it to a cheap miniature single computer. Then connect to the general -purpose input and output kick (GPIO). This combination can produce a powerful platform for creating artificial intelligence applications. It is a "revolutionary warfare." Available resources, do the best combination.

A Ukraine engineer who claims to be "MAX" said that Ukraine has a huge CCTV camera network and other monitoring infrastructure. The military uses these ready -made resources to analyze visual data through artificial intelligence technology to master the enemy's dynamics. He believes that Ukraine's engineers are trying their best to win the war under the fire. But Russian engineers are completely different, and they tried to avoid associated with this war. It was not until recently they started collecting data.

It can be seen that Ukraine is truly mobilized by the whole people, and the integration of military and civilians is in place quickly. Compared with Russia, he made a judgment.

** folk intelligence network **

George Dubynskiy, deputy minister of Ukraine Digital Transformation Department, told the "Fox NewsDigital" that part of the key to obtaining the advantage is that Ukraine decides to create its own artificial intelligence platform so that engineers can customize according to specific purposes Essence

American columnist David Ignatius revealed that Mykhailofedorov, the minister of Ukraine Digital Transformation Department in December last year, answered his written questions and listed some military technical systems developed by Ukraine. This includes a security chat system called "EVOROG". Since the beginning of the war, the system has allowed the public to provide 453,000 battlefield information and purchase a "drone team" composed of 200 people from commercial suppliers for air reconnaissance and a battlefield surveying and mapping system called "Delta". It contains real -time actual data, and the military can be used to plan action.

(Agence France -Prestery Picture) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T14-45-00-04-00/000003.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/junshiwujinqu/mil-07132023141348.html/image-1.png)

Fervrov pointed out that the victory of this war was the high -tech advantage of Ukraine and the rapid adaptability of the Ukraine. "This is the most advanced war in human history," which is very different from the past. It is also described as the common victory of humans and machines.

Iigneus published a comment article entitled "Algorithm to Broken Breakfast in Ukraine" in the Washington Post in December last year. Algorithms (algorithms) are one of the three core elements of artificial intelligence. It is divided into different types such as machine learning and deep learning. By learning and training a large amount of data, computers can automatically identify the model and make predictions and decisions. The other two are computing power (the hardware and infrastructure of the algorithm, such as graphical processor GPU) and data.

The well -known columnist went to Ukraine to see an amazing scene at the scene. Two Ukrainian officers are looking at a Ukrainian technician to use the US data analysis software company Palantir to provide software operations with software operations. On the screen is a detailed digital map on the Bach Murte battlefield in eastern Ukraine, showing dense target intelligence, most of which come from commercial satellites. In fact, this combat system is really revolutionary, it is that it aggregates data from commercial suppliers.

When he approached, seeing the Bayurut's front -line trenches and targets on the screen, Ukrainian officers could use target programs to select missiles, artillery or armed drones to attack the Russian position displayed on the screen. Then the drone can confirm the attack and feedback the damage assessment into the system. This is a secret digital battle that has never been reported in detail before, just like David in the Bible defeated the giant Goalia. The Ukraine is integrated with their brave fighting spirit with the most advanced intelligence and combat management software.

** Algorithm war constitutes a fatal killing chain **

Alex Karp, chief executive of Palandir, said in an email: "The power of the advanced algorithmicwarfare system is now very powerful, which is equivalent to having tactical nuclear weapons to deal with opponents with only conventional weapons." However, the public often underestimate this.

It has been reported that Pallandir played a very critical role in the Russia and Ukraine War. After the war broke out, it was the first businessman of the Ukrainian President Volodymyrzlenskyy, and the company set up an office in Ukraine.

With the approval of Karp, the company Kiev Office showed some technologies close to the fire line (shooting line) to Igneusus. One of the software platforms allowed American allies to use ubiquitous and unstoppable sensors. These sensors surrounded them around Each potential battlefield creates a truly fatal "kill chain".

The direct feeling he saw was that this was a new deterrent. Not only in Ukraine, but in view of this technological revolution, the challenges facing opponents when attacking Taiwan are much more severe than they think. On this emerging digital battlefield, the information obtained by China is: think twice.

Ukraine Digital Transformer Minister Ferdorov told the well -known American columnist that the electronic killing chain "in Khaster, Izium, Kharkiv, and Kyiv (Kyiv)" The regional liberation period is particularly useful. "

The killing chain is a military concept that describes the entire process from obtaining information to executing attacks. Including the identification goals, planning and combat, command control, execution of attack and evaluation effects. For example, the Ukrainian army found that there were suspected Russian tanks in the distant forests. How to use artificial intelligence technology to launch the killing chain of the killing chain has the following:

The first target recognition, through image processing and computer vision technology, recognize the tank target that may be hidden in the woods. The second target positioning, artificial intelligence can achieve a large number of precise positioning targets in sensors and reconnaissance equipment. The third target tracking, using artificial intelligence and tracking algorithms to continuously track the movement and position changes, maintain continuous observation of the target. The fourth blow planning, using the artificial intelligence auxiliary system planning the best attack strategy and firepower support, including calculating the best shooting position, considering terrain and enemy defense.

Fifth attack execution, when using artillery, missiles, or other weapon systems, artificial intelligence can provide assistance and accuracy during navigation and shooting. The sixth attack evaluation is accurately evaluated by artificial intelligence, including the hit rate, the degree of destruction, and the impact of the enemy tank, which helps evaluate the combat effect and adjust the follow -up combat plan.

** Classic War of War of Intelligent War **

Iigneus pointed out in the article that the Russians also tried to create their own electronic battlefield tools, but they had little effect. They tried to use commercial satellite data and videos transmitted through cheap Chinese drones. But it is difficult for them to coordinate and share these data between the troops. They also lack the ability to connect with the "Starlink" system. In this regard, Ukraine obviously occupies the upper hand.

The Ukrainian officer told him that each Ukrainian camp -level combat unit was equipped with his own software developers. The core advantage of Ukraine is not only the will of the army's fighting, but also the technical strength.

The Ukraine showed the amazing combat power of small fighting, and the world is obvious to all. They successfully used artificial intelligence technology not only gaining advantages on the battlefield, but also humans entering an intelligent war to demonstrate a lively classic battle.

This column premiered a new program every Friday, and there were several backs after it. You can listen to short waves, or listen through YouTube and RFA's official website.

Through this strategy, Germany responded to China, which has "changed and has more offensive performance".

A Chinese policy is also mentioned in the document, saying that a Chinese policy is still the foundation of the German government. At the same time, Germany and Taiwan have maintained a close and good relationship in many fields and hope to expand. Under the framework of an EU policy, support Taiwan to participate in relevant international organizations.

In this context, the use of key components is reviewed in accordance with the Federal Information Technology Security Law.

### China's impact in Germany

The document refers to China's impact on Germany and the so -called "overseas police station" and other institutions, saying that appropriate measures are taken at the country and the European Union level. In addition, the German government will continue to closely observe "monitoring and political manipulation of some Chinese overseas groups in Germany through the structure of the party organization."

The document states that especially in high -tech enterprises and world -leading companies in the industry.

Milan Kundera left at the age of 94.

On April 1, 1929, he was born in Czechoslovakia. His father was a pianist. He had received good music enlightenment since he was a child. In his growth stage, he gradually turned to writing, and his mother country was also experiencing the change of the times at the same time, and his personal life also experienced twists and turns. In 1975, he finally chose to settle in France, and then insisted on writing in French and gradually won the world's reputation.

Like many writers, Kundela tried different literary themes in his early years, and he was involved in poetry and drama. In the end, he found his voice, his style, and even himself in the novel. Why are we still talking about Kundela today? Or change a question, why are we still reading novels? Kundela himself, in his long life, is also exploring the true meaning of the form of novels. He is also describing the simplified world in the hustle and bustle and portraying its complex existence.

** Novel spirit: complexity **

Throughout his life, Kundera used novelists to claim, far away from the performance of performance, and disgusted the political aesthetics of kitsch. This position has made him part ways with many former friends, and even alienated relationships with the mother country. In his opinion, becoming a novelist is not only practicing a "literary genre", but also "a kind of attitude, a wisdom, a position". He understood and agreed with the point of view of the novelist Herman Bloch. "It is the only reason to find that only what the novel can be discovered is the novel."

So, what exactly is the novel? Kundela clearly pointed out that the spirit of the novel is complexity, and each novel is telling the reader: "Things are more complex than you think." Kundela believes that Cevantes, Balzac, Tolstoy, Fu, Fu, Fu, Fu, Blessing, Blessing The ancient wisdom of the novel created by Lou Bai and others is worthy of cherishment. However, under the impact of modernity, the truth of the novel is superfluous and even forgotten.

Kundela has always been proud of the Czech Republic. Writers on the land Kafka and Hasieck were regarded as his pioneers, or further, he was proud of European civilization. He believes that the form of novels is a common product of different languages in different languages in Europe. The arrival of modern society has made European civilization continue to lose, especially about the existence of people. This is the truth that many philosopher writers have learned more than a hundred years ago and criticized it. Kundela believes that behind this criticism, it actually reveals the dual nature of the modern times: "both degenerate, progressive, and like all human things, it contains the seeds of its end when it produces."

Under such circumstances, Kundela believes that the modernity of the novel is to continue to explore the specific life of people and protect this specific life that escapes "forgotten": "A novel, if not found that it was still at the time, it was still at that time. Unknown existence, then it is an immoral novel. Knowledge is the only morality of the novel. "

Kundela's defense of novel morality also means resistance to simplification. In contemporary times, the death of novels has been mentioned countless times. This is a classic literary topic, which also comes from the impact of modernity. Under the impact of globalization, the spirit of the times has become increasingly simplified, and the spirit of the novel is contrary to the eclipse of the novel. Kundela compares it as a "simplified puppetworm". Significance. Novels (just as all culture) increasingly fell into the hands of various media. The media that expanded as the historical integration of the earth expanded and clarified the simplification process; they spread the same people all over the world. Humans, the simplified sides and vulgar sets accepted by all human beings. And different mouthpiece shows different political interests. It is not important. After the different surfaces, in fact, it is a common spirit to rule. "

Perhaps because of this, Kunderla has become more and more absent in his later years. He keeps a distance about the media and even critics and biologists. He uses a rejected gesture to oppose the interpretation of simplified and defend the complexity of himself and his works. He once said that, "The characteristics of a real novelist: I don't like to talk about myself."

** Light and heavy **

There are not many works in Kunderla. In his later years, his work was selected into the famous French Seven Star Library(Pleiad)When he chose his own work, he abandoned a lot.

In his works, the most widely influential influence is probably "The Light of Life Unbearable". In the Chinese world, its original translation "Unbearable Light in Life" is even more familiar. This novel has been adapted into the movie "The Love of Prague". It has starring stars such as Juliet and Binos, which is probably the most popular novel in Kundera.

What story does this novel write? It seems to talk about the emotional stories of a few pairs of men and women. The background is under the historical drama of the Soviet Union's invasion of the Czech in the 1960s, discussing topics such as politics, love, existence and life. This novel has been discussed so far with its unique philosophical meaning. Kundela believes that the novel is similar to the building and has its own pillars. The pillar of this novel involves the following keywords, "heavy, light, soul, body, great march, feces, kitsch, pity, dizziness, strength, weakness."

"Eternal reincarnation is a mysterious idea. Nietzsche once used it to put a lot of philosophers in a dilemma: think about it, one day, everything will be reproduced in the way we have experienced, and this repeated repeatedly will be repeated!What does a delirium mean? "This is the first sentence of the novel. For Kundera, this sentence has already clicked the basic situation of the protagonist Totomas:" That is, in a world without eternal reincarnation The existence is light. "

Light and heavy, it is Thomas's existence password, and it can even be said to be one of the mother questions of Kundera's novels. Light or corresponding to it, this theme has appeared many times in Kunderla's novels. His initial novel "Joking" has mentioned, "Walking on the dusty road, I feel empty and heavy. Light, pressing on my life. "In addition," Living elsewhere "," Farewell to the Yuan Dance ", and" Laughing forgot "are also involved. Second!Then I comfort myself: All novelists may just write a theme with various variations. "

Light and heavy, the opposition between the two is "the most mysterious and blurred among all opposites", and its tap also constitutes the difficulty of life. There is no eternal correct answer. Feeling complexity. "It's really cruel, but the lightness is really beautiful?" - The heavy is responsibility, also oppression, and also assumed, but it may bring life close to the truth of the earth. Even escaping is "half really existed", which is out of light and become "freedom and meaningless."

** Kundela's contemporary significance **

Since the 1980s, Kundera has been introduced into the Chinese world, causing a lot of attention and imitation. Whether or not it really understands, "Light of Life", "Kaifeng" and his famous sayings are still being cited. He once said that "grasping the complexity in the modern world means a simple and concentrated technique for me." Obviously he has mastered this technique without winning the Nobel Prize, but it seems that there is a lack of Nobel Prize judges' taste. In Kundedra, no loss.However, this year, I have the desire to re -read him, especially in the years of Shanghai Fengcheng Re -reading "The Light of Unbearable Life". The so -called classic is actually the kind of commonly read and new books, and novels are actually the best portrait for incomparable absurdity. Opening this book again, the reading memory of that year is still there, but every sentence feels flowing into the gap between the mind, like a note, silk like a note. I did n’t understand, I did n’t like it when I was a kid, I can now read, understand, and agree. This is the change of the times and the personal changes. This book proposes "kitsch", but because the book is too famous and the title of the book is too ears, how many people have misunderstood the "kitsch" proposed by him. He will laugh at ignorance and be cold, but he will also have tenderness to the weak.

Novels, even if it is a great novel, may not have changed the direct power of the present and even a moment, but it can have the value of the record of time. When the smoke clouds of politics and times are dissipated, valuable novels will not be damaged. I have talked in the economic man's reading during the city. In the past two years, I may be suitable for re -reading in Kundela -perhaps, maybe it is the moment of survival dilemma, which is precisely the most suitable moment for re -reading novels. Kundela can always laugh at the unspeakable absurd situation, and it seems that this situation is not so frightening. When I was a kid, I always felt that he was not deep enough, but when he was old, he understood that some of his life was not so profound, some, but only endless absurd. At this time, being able to ridicule or easily ironically is actually a profound self -protection of the "weak", as Kundera once commented on Kafka's novels as comedy.

The Economy Reading Club Book Friendship Teacher Jian Triumph was the Eastern European Literature Research. He first introduced Kundera to the translator of the Chinese world. He once said that "the Czech Republic needs Harvey, and it also needs Kundera." For the world, having Kundera is also our luck, which has made the world an irreplaceable voice since then -novels are immortal and Kundela is immortal.

In the past few days, two of the most popular things on the Chinese public opinion field are the case of "Private Floating Bridge" in Wafang Town, Wafang Town, Panan City, Jilin Province; the other is Yellen and Chinese female scholars. The dinner was questioned.

Two things, one happening in the remote and backward rural countryside, only related to the lives of the villagers, is a trivial matter and the bottom. The other occurs in Beijing. Communication is a big deal and high -end affairs. The two things seem to be unpredictable, but they are drove by the same deep psychological motivation and become a hot spot.

Judging from the current reports, the original report made "private pilling bridge" enter the official vision. In fact, objectively speaking, the official attitude has some extent. The initial clue was to report the report and then transferred to the public security organs, but in the end they did not do it with black. It seems not difficult to come in from the number and organizational nature. But in the end, only 50,000 yuan was identified in the amount identification, and 18 people were sentenced to probation. Generally speaking, the official calibers of each level of such hot events are highly consistent. Interestingly, the staff of the people's government of the Wafeng Town actually denied the situation of mandatory charges.

Therefore, perhaps the whole thing is to continue to promote. The reporter Li did not avoid his report. In the face of the interview, he said: "The people now have cars, the road is good, and it doesn't matter. It is for charging. "He emphasized the charge.

There may be rural pastoral and watches in Chinese villages. When someone finds that it can easily pull people down by reporting, then someone must do it like this. The thrill of smashing other people's rice bowls is even more refreshing than holding a bowl of meals.

The Internet violence encountered in Yellen's dinner is also due to this psychological mechanism.

All the elite women participating in the dinner are much higher than the ordinary people. The allegations of traitors and traitors can pull them down.

A normal visit, global attention, all schedules in China are open, negotiated, and eat with Yelun, can there be a conspiracy space? These people actually know.

My mother told me that when she was in junior high school, the Chinese hydrogen bomb exploded successfully. There was a 14 -year -old in the same grade. The active girl usually joked: The egg explosion was successful. As a result, it was said to be a counter -revolutionary, and the flowers were tied up. Those people really think that a 14 -year -old girl is so bad? These people actually know.

Do they really think that the name of Tsinghua University is because of "invading China"? Can the school name of the top famous schools in China really show up for a hundred years and still hiding a big conspiracy? These people actually know.

Many scholars have been invited by a Japanese fund before to visit and live in Japan for a while. Later, many people questioned to promote Japan with money. Until the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Wenbin, when answering the reporter's question, he made a clarification and actively evaluated such exchanges, saying that China and Japan would also arrange more two -way communication, and the question was abruptly stopped. This large -scale invitation to visit well -known scholars may really use money to publicize? These people actually know.

However, there was no apology or clarification, and they began to find new enemies, and then it was female scholars at Yelun Dinner.

These people actually know everything, but the sense of power of smashing people's rice bowls is so attractive. "The anger of justice" is attractive because it contains "overwhelming the power of a person". Especially when a certain kind of power can allow people who usually "be in power" to obtain power. Smash other people's rice bowls and let the strong fall into the dust. Or when the strong man falls, go to a foot, so that he must not turn over forever. This power can be disgusting, can be wantonly evaluating the figure, the top of the outline, the hats on the outline, the smashing of a person's rice bowl, and letting a star say goodbye to the stage.

Ironically, if you can't smash the rice bowl, this motivation will be greatly weakened.

As long as the child sees a star with a flaw, he will learn badly, and they shout such logic. But ironic is that Musk, who has publicly live broadcast of drugs, multiple divorces, ambiguous, and speculative currency harvested retail investors, has also been greatly respected in China. Give Musk's words "flawlessly" because they can't smash Musk's rice bowl.

This anger will spread into everyone's life.

Grasp the big white goose machine, the cheongsam on the milk cup, and the short sleeves on the spicy strips have become the reason for smashing the rice bowl. Some people say that people on milk tea are too exposed; some people say that a word contains a word on the Xinhua Dictionary; some people say that the Xinhua Dictionary does not include a word. Some people say that they should not wear clothes like this; and some people say that the lantern is like Japan. No evidence, no demonstration, no consensus, only "I think", as long as you use the banner of justice, you can make mistakes, wrongdoing, and smashing your fellow citizen's rice bowl without having to bear any responsibility.

Smashting other people's rice bowls and destroying the lives of others has a hearty pleasure. But the price is everyone's nervousness. Just yesterday, in the signboard of the Spring Postal Savings Bank City South Sub -branch, there were many spelling errors in English, of which "China" was written as "CIHNA". The bank involved said that the letters of the letters did not know and rectified. This should have been a trivial matter, but now it has become a big news.

Everyone's rice bowl, everyone's lives, are connected together. When everyone in the market is worried, the evaluation of risks will become higher, and market activities will stagnate.

Under the report, the Floating Bridge, as an effective asset, disappeared from Chinese economic activities, and disappeared three times. The efficiency of the pass from this has improved and disappeared. Just a few days ago, if the owner of the big white goose was smaller, he would withdraw this machine, then the Chinese economic cycle disappeared.

The young man who runs the big white goose opened a good head and rejected it directly. Individuals, enterprises, and government agencies should be so, and they are unwilling to follow this ridiculous "correct". Indeed, female scholars who participated in Yelun Dinner responded to respond and sue Weibo to surf the Internet. They are ordinary people who are traitors, just like rocket experts and people arguing whether the Rockets burns coal. However, this behavior is not just maintaining itself, but to maintain a more secure and stable market and social atmosphere.

** Reading in one minute: **

Recently, "Russia Today" released a 36 -second film on Bilibili and Weibo, such as Bilibili and Weibo, stating that the Ukrainian Odeza recruitment office violently enlisted in the army. Immediately, the film spread a lot in mainland news and social media. Asian facts investigation of the laboratory traceability found that its original film comes from a self -proclaimed report of the dynamic social media Telegram account "＠xyDessa", which is a self -proclaimed report. After the video was released, the official statement clarified that the man was not a recruitment of soldiers. Instead, they were arrested for violating border regulations. In addition, whether the man really has criminals across the border, there is still controversy in the Ukrainian community.

**In-depth analysis:**

On July 9, Russia's state -owned media "Russia Today (RT) (RT) (RT) was [Bilibili] in [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1oz4y1E793/?share_source=copy_web)And [Weibo](https://weibo.com/6244553417/N95Qj0Nj2)Published a film, the title "The front line is missing? Ukraine once again staged the scene of violent recruitment", and the text described "July 9th, in Odessa in Ukraine, the staff of the recruitment office" persuaded "local residents Go to the Ukrainian armed forces to serve. "Subsequently, the same film began to spread on the Chinese Internet, and reposted the video number of provincial and municipal media such as" see news "and" poster news ", and further interpreted this video as the Ukraine front line The losses are heavy and need to be replenished, which has a wide influence.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T15-23-37-04-00/000004.png)The film was forwarded by multiple provincial and municipal media video videos (screenshot of WeChat video number) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T15-23-37-04-00/000005.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-07132023151138.html/3010pic1-130118be589c698917ecf592791cf4e2d56fd5a924f538d2653f78f6c8f7d.png)The film's perspective was shot outward in the car. Four men wearing military green clothes and guns were equipped with a gray -clothes man, and they tied his hands with a bundle with a bundle. Several trucks have been opened in the background, but there are no more clues to confirm the location of the incident.

** Where is the film originated? **

According to the floating watermark "Xyebaя Oдecca" and a paper plane pattern appearing in the film, we rejected this film [Posted on July 9th on social media Telegram account ＠xyDessa](https://t.me/xydessa/32207)Essence The film describes "Ao Deza residents are" affectionately "invited to the military recruitment office." However, the Telegram account subsequently updated below the post, indicating that the man in the film was not a soldier but a border officer in the film. The man was arrested for refusing to provide documents and tried to overtake border officers and affect traffic.

However, the account of the release of the film was corrected, negating that this was a statement of recruitment.In order to verify whether the film is related to violent recruitment, we further analyzed the audio and screen of the film.

First of all, Ukrainian strategist scholar and former research scholar of the Taiwan Institute of Defense Security, Yuriipoita, helped us analyze the audio and transferred the audio word -by -content content in the film. The female voice in the film said that she was afraid, and did not know what would happen, and did not dare to get out of the car. The conversation mentioned "I don't know where David is at all."

Боже, боже, мой я.

The above content cannot determine whether "David" is the arrested man, nor does it mention any content related to the recruitment.

At the same time, the clothes arrested in the film are printed on the back of the clothes "Enabling Betterlives" and "Ingeus.co.uk". According to this URL, we found this is a career training company in the UK, and we found, and we found a career training company in the UK. Its German branches have related plans for Ukrainian refugees. We went to inquire, hoping to verify the identity of the man, but not received a reply before the release.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T15-23-37-04-00/000010.png)The drawing on the capture of the arrest in the film screenshot is consistent with a British company (Asian factual inspection laboratory drawing) [![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T15-23-37-04-00/000011.png)](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-07132023151138.html/3010pic43011622a56fe5bf96bd4.png)** Ukrainian official response to the dispute again **

The film not only spread in China, but also attracted the attention of Ukraine. Ukrainian military reporter Andriytsaplienko posted four states of the Ukraine National Border Defense Bureau spokesman Andriy Demchenko in Telegram, which were:

1. The incident in the film has nothing to do with the recruitment order.

2. The soldiers of the State Border Defense Bureau in the photo, not the recruitment officer.

3. The driver of the vehicle conflicts in the border checkpoint and refuses to follow the instructions of the border guards.

4. He tried to hit a soldier, and the man was forcibly detained and handed over to the police.

The reporter issued by this statement also pointed out that although the behavior in the film is not a violent recruitment, it does not mean that the employees of the Odeza recruitment office have no abuse of power.

Although the Ukrainian National Border Department did not publicly respond to the matter, this statement also reported through other media, such as [Ukrainian investigation report organization Nikcenter](https://nikcenter.org/2023/07/v-merezhi-zyavylosya-video-yak-v-odesi-vijskovi-zalamuyut-ruky-cholovikovi-yakyj-nibyto-vidmovyvsya-otrymuvaty-povistku/), Higher credibility.

I am going to engage in church activities.

In order to verify the above statement, we tried private messages, but they were not successful because of the news restrictions.

**in conclusion:**In addition, Ukrainian reporters also obtained a statement from the State Border Defense Bureau spokesman, saying that the film recorded was not a conflict between recruitment, but the conflict between the public and the Border Inspection Bureau. Therefore, this video does not provide sufficient evidence to prove that Ukraine is recruiting violence.

The domestic animated film "Changan Thirty Miles" released in the summer vacation this summer has exceeded 300 million box office in five days, and the Japanese Douban score is 8.0, which has gradually risen.

Many parents watched the trailer and rushed into the cinema with their children without hesitation. In their expectations, this should be a cartoon with Tang poetry as the main line, like anime version of "Chinese Poetry Conference". Taking advantage of the summer vacation to let the children receive traditional cultural education, this way of entertaining is what many parents are willing to accept.

In the trailer, Li Bai and his poems, drove fairy cranes to break the waves and soar thousands of miles. The song "Will into the Wine", with the free and easy of the Xianxian, shows the pride of life and the gorgeousness of the Tang Dynasty. Sauvignon Blanc, in Chang'an, how can you not meet.

After all, Chang'an is not only poetry, it also has its prosperity and disgrace, and the sorrow and joy are separated. The historical fragments that can't be escaped are used to tell stories, and it is nearly three hours.

The film started from the background of the Anshi Rebellion. Unlike the film with similar history as the background, Tang Minghuang and Yang Guifei appeared here. Even Gaolishi only appeared a name, and it was also performed artistic processing. The real protagonist is Gao Shi. As for Li Bai, as his friend, he appeared in his memories.

In the era of danger, Li Bai and Gao Shi, two poets with different personalities, have a very different life encounters. From the youth to the twilight years, they have gained the wine countless times, leaving only a collection of poems, recording the coming and going of the two and poetry. Gao Shi envied Li Bai's talent and freeness. He couldn't write those famous famous sentences, nor could he be carnival all day long. He couldn't do it. Li Bai always missed this old friend, but he was unwilling to follow the routine and clumsy road. He wanted to take a career between heaven and earth and set up a career between heaven and earth. He continued to try, even if he took an unusual way. Poetry only occasionally appeared in their talks, and it was not as concentrated as imagined.

Unlike the previous ancient style film and television dramas, "Changan Thirty Miles" not only rely on a historical background, but also tells a history, or a historical story. Although some historical enthusiasts have raised a lot of doubts, after all, film and television works are not historical materials, defects, and re -processing. They are worthy of tolerance and collection, seeking common ground while depositing differences.

In order to tell this story, the main creative team refers to a lot of information and use the animation effect to restore Changan's style. In the play, the figure proportion of the figure refers to the Tang figurine. The upper body has a shorter body and has a five -headed perspective effect. Princess Yuzhen is full of figure, and her makeup looks like the lady in the "Flower Ladies' Pictures" painted by Zhou Yan. The horses in the film are fat and healthy, and the shape of Tang Zhaoling Liujun Stone is exactly the same. There are also Changan's markets, luxurious Hu Ji wine restaurants, the fork gifts often appearing in the character shape, the dance of Yangzhou singing girl, and even Li Baijiao's sumo technique for Gao Shi.

Whether the Taoism is sophisticated and whether it is close to historical materials is an important condition for considering the level of film and television drama. The TV series "Twelve Times of Chang'an" with the background of Sheng Tang. In addition to the wonderful plot and the high degree of restoration of Taoism, it has also been praised by the audience. The Changanfang City built in the play, from regulation to the length and width ratio, is recorded in historical data. The unique method of wearing the "Wuwu" played by Yi Xi Qianxi also brought out the historical reasons of the Tang Dynasty Mu Dao.

The promotion of film and television works, the trend of revival of traditional culture, and ancient style have become today's popular trends, and Xi'an has also become a popular tourist destination for recent holidays. Young girls are dressed in costumes, makeup facilities, immersed punching, and they work hard to create the prosperous picture of Datang in the camera. Although there are elements of violations from time to time, they will not interfere with their interest. They know that this is just a game. This Tang Yun is a dream and a dream. Singing for a while.

If Xi'an is a real base for "impressive Tang", then this "Changan 30,000 Miles" is a virtual Datang dream built with anime effect. All technical methods that tend to be true are helping the audience to complete a dream of Datang. They want to see the free and colorful Tang Dynasty. At that time, the poets were endless, just like the clips in Hu Ji wine restaurant in the film. When each poet appeared, the verses became their label. The audience knew the poet's name because they were familiar with those verses. He Zhizhang, Wang Wei, and Wang Changling, appeared on the screen on the screen, the upper part of their works, and some people must pick up the next couple in the auditorium. Only when Zhang Xu appeared, there was less response. Compared with ancient poems, calligraphy looks more niche after all, so this crazy calligraphy has a less resonance. Although he is also one of the "Drinking Eight Immortals", he also introduced his cursive script and Li Bai's poems, Pei Yan's sword dance and called "three musts", but it is always better than those who have appeared in the language documents since childhood. Poetry.

In traditional Chinese culture, poetry is a symbol, which has almost become synonymous with traditional culture. Qinqi, calligraphy and painting are also important, but there is no influence of poetry. Every child who speaks Chinese will recite Tang poems and Song poetry, and the understanding of many historical figures also starts with poetry. When the TV series "Qingpingle" aired in previous years, a stills circulated on the Internet that "recite and write the sky group" on the Internet. This drama tells the life of Song Renzong, and the eighth Tang and Song dynasties we are familiar with the other six in the Song Renzong period except Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, plus Fan Zhongyan and Sima Guang. There are all in the play. They aroused the memory of many audiences when they were reading, and the tests that they repeatedly recited and did and did it on the test papers could not be forgotten. When the plot unfolded, some audiences reacted. They not only had handed down poems, but also unusual achievements, and the latter was their main business.

The audience is more willing to remember those long and short sentences, because more vitality can move their hearts. At first, these verses were written by poets in different situations, and they could find out the corresponding history from these verses. Second, many poems have brought a lot of strength and comfort to themselves, becoming part of their own life, and more empathy.

Therefore, in the nearly three hours of "Changan Thirty Miles", although there are only a few parts that belong to poetry, and except for "Joining Wine", more than forty songs, most of them only appear or only one of them or appears or appeared. It is a couple. However, this does not affect the audience expressing their emotions. From time to time, collective recitation will appear. The young children recite on the spot. Although they are old -fashioned, they can see a lot of meditation.

Because of being familiar, poetry has become a clue of many audiences to understand the plot. As a result, many promotional films and film reviews will still ignore the main line of the characters and use poetry as the main topic. Like all art works, once the author completes the creation, the right to interpret it will be in the hands of the audience. Literary works are like this, as well as history.When Li Bai was forgiven to mention the end of the exile, boiled on the water, and chanted the "Early White Emperor City". The mothers and daughters sitting on the side are discussing, "No wonder he wants to" pay back a day to the thousand miles of Jiangling ", and the days of exile are really difficult." They have always been suspicious.

Li Bai on the big screen is not the poem fairy they want. Although Li Bai is also an ordinary person. Although Li Bai also has a bumpy life, he wrote so many splendid verses, and the audience hoped to see Li Bai in their hearts. So although poetry is only a good light film of this film, everyone is willing to choose to remember and magnify this emotion.

At the end of the film, Gao Shi made emotions, "As long as the poetry is, Changan is there." This Changan is not Changan, who is not a thousand households, nor is it a return to Huimin Street. This Changan is presented in the long volume of poems at the end of the film, and it is also continuously reshaped and re -built in the hearts of the audience.(This article only represents the author's personal point of view, edit mailbox: zhen.zhu@ftchinese.com)

At dusk, a ferry from the port of Iraqi, Iraqi, Crete Island from the port of Breevs. On the boat, the masterpiece "Greek Zoba", a writer who was born on Crete, was re -looked at the same name of Greek composer Tiollakis, adapted from the book adapted from the book, " "Zaba Dance" has so far all over the streets and alleys of Athens and islands. When the night sailing on the sea, the string is still in the ears. Now when I read this novel carefully, the story turned out to start with the protagonist in Athens and other ships to Crete Island.

In the early morning of the next day, before the sunrise, the Kolit Island capital of Iraqi Lion's port at the port of Crete Island was gradually appeared outside the porthole. The sun gradually rises after the shore. Looking up, there is a whole wall painting above the port, depicting in Greek mythology, Icaros, with his father and the designer of the Minnos maze, wears wings made by wax. When flying, Icaros flew too close to the sun, and his wings were gradually melted. In the painting, he was planning towards the sea.

This fascinating Greek mythology from a young age is a surprise. However, the off -boats felt hungry. The Knoos Royal Palace in the city of Iraqi, and the maze of the half -cow monster Mino Tao had to be first. Hurry up the taxi and go to the residence of Elounda, the east bank of the island.

It was less than eight o'clock when I arrived at the residence of Linhai, so I rushed to breakfast. When the traditional breakfast ingredients of Crete Island, which suddenly lined up in the bottle and can: Haippen, olive, goat milk cheese, sevil, tomato and old bread, I started to realize that The Cleut Island catering culture, which has won countless people, will be an important part of this journey.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T15-27-21-00-00/000187334_piclink.png)Photography: Zhang Lu Shi

It turns out that the four mornings of breakfast, from Elounda Peninsula to Eloundamare, I can see the same new Crete's traditional snacks every day, and I remember it. For example, "Kalitsounia" is a hot honey snack with Mizithra sheep milk soft cheese used on the island. Hyapono and Niu Mo, which are produced in Create, compared to the spice tent and cow to the end I commonly seen in England, the salty flavor is higher. One day when I drove up the mountain to find a small restaurant, a ancient village suddenly appeared between the winding wilderness. There was an innovative traditional grandmother's kitchen hidden in the village. I tried one of the special dishes called "AIGAVRASTI", which means cooked goat. Many recipes from the period from Minos Civilization, that is, a history of three or four thousand years, can also be seen here.

Ielda has only been developed since the 1980s, and is a relatively late area on Crete. SPYROSKOKOTOS, who was born in Iraqilion and completed his studies in Athens, is a "crab eater" to develop a tranquil fishing village. He was built by Hai design and built a hotel and villa named "Eloda". It was the first batch of resort villages in Greece. After the Greek Prime Minister at the time came on vacation, he also invited Spyros to participate in the administration of Greek tourism. However, it is understood that in recent years, the Greek island has issued a new policy, and it is not allowed to build hotels and resorts on the beach to "return to the beach to the people."

Arrived in Ielda, there was a sense of barrenness at the end of the world. Surrounding us is endless seawater, the people who have lived up to the present thousands of years ago, and an ancient city of Olous, which was sinking under the water two thousand years ago. But get closer, you will see the pod tree all over the sea; Xinbu steps to an ancient village in the mountains and see lemon, olives, coriander, and flowers without flowers, and there is no flower. People didn't see a few. At that time, I felt that some of the abundant sense of absence in urban life had suddenly melted us in the "edge of the world". It is said that the folk customs of Ielda are still simple today, and the villagers living nearby are usually not afraid of being stolen. The architect SPYROS, who has now reached the years, has written a history of Ielda in recent years. The former French President Mitterrand and others have arrived, and stay in the villa in Chaohai for a while to temporarily cut off their communication with the outside world.

In this history of the interrogation, I mentioned the well -preserved old style of Crete Island. I also experienced it in Ida. culture. Outside some new houses, I saw the rain canal structure of the old stone house. Cultural traditions and customs are well preserved, but there is also the other side of the coin. I have always heard that Crete has its own cultural identity, which is very different from the folk customs of Athens and other islands in Greece.

After watching the history of the interrogation, Philip, who grew up in the Economics of Iraqilion, Iraqilion, who met in the village of Iraqi, was talked to me. There are guns in the people, because the opponent's "one eye is not pleasing to the eye" and the sesame trivial matters such as the car stopping the house may cause the murder case, which will cause a series of family revenge incidents, which is no different from "the Middle Ages". Philip also said that the "territory" contradiction between the olive garden owner and the shepherd shepherd is deep. When returning to the mountain village every year, he will help his father to take care of the olive garden. To avoid trouble. Just as I was afraid of the actions of the actions on the mountain village before the day before, Philip added a sentence: "But the mountain people are very polite to tourists. When they encounter the infringement of the foreign enemy, Isn't this the family's revenge of "Romeo and Juliet"?

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T15-27-21-00-00/000187332_piclink.png)Photography: Zhang Lu Shi

In those days, I have been walking between the ancient sea and the deep valley. Looking at the map, the eastern coast of Crete Island is the European Island, the closest to the Middle East and North Africa. This sea area often suffers from Arab pirates in history. For 20 minutes from the coastal coast, you can reach another village Agiosnikolaos. At this time, a small island suddenly appeared in the sea. Looking from a distance, you can also see that the planning on the island is fine.No one has lived on the island so far. From San Nicolaos, you have a small boat to go to the island. If you like diving, you can also look at the ancient city sank on the water. But just like this, it is a little majestic and mysterious island, and imagination is enough for the time being.

In the same seawater, a sinking ancient city of Olous, which was also hidden in the seawater for more than ten minutes. I walked around this "City of the Sea" that accidentally discovered. There was no attraction development here. When I did n’t know the reason, I only felt that it was an open, abandoned corner, but there was a reserved infinite infinitely retained. Mystery. Archaeological data said that the ancient city sank in about the 2nd century or because of the earthquake. Some broken walls can be seen on the shore. You can also see the mosaic floor more than 2,000 years ago. Right, a goose came out under the olive tree of the garden next door.

Crete is the oldest civilization in Europe, and the identity in history has always been unique, and it did not become part of Greece until 1913. The island is large, and it takes more than four hours to drive from the east to west. The most concentrated tourist is the capital of the capital Iraqilion. It takes an hour drive from Elida to the Knoos Palace of the Knooshos Palace from the east to the Kanoshos Palace.

The ancient civilization of Crete is a giant mirror hanging between Europe and Africa. The core is the Minos dynasty that witnessed the origin of the Aegean Civilization. The volcanic eruption of the island caused the tsunami, causing the Minos civilization overnight. After many years, the Romans simply destroyed the ancient city of Knoos. The ruins of the Knoos Palace we saw today are difficult to inspire mad thinking.

This immediately reminds me of the island of Santorini four years ago. The locals are more accustomed to the island called its original Greek "Sira Island". It is also the place where the largest volcanic eruption in human history has recorded in the history of human history. It was this tragedy that directly led to the collapse of the Minor civilization on Crete Island in the south, and the entire central part of the Sira was sinking to the bottom of the sea. I have only developed the monuments in recent years to look at it. It was an ancient village named Akrotiri at the southern end of Sira Island. It went on the volcanic rocks under the wind and the scorching sun, and farther and farther away from the popular area of tourists. Bailang is getting closer to a long dream of human beings. The village of Akrotley was next to the quiet bay, and the fishing boat was gently swinging in the wind. This is a bit similar to the Elounda Bay in Crete.

The original Village of Akroti became the colonies of the Krete Island Minos in 3,000 BC. The villagers learned to plant olive trees and food, and even create painted art. From the 20th to 17th centuries BC, it became one of the Aegis and Trade Centers in the Aegean Sea, which had trade with Cyprus and Egypt. Then one day, suddenly everything was over. Around the 16th century BC, the largest volcanic outbreak in prehistoric human history occurred here. Later scholars called "Minos Volcano Enter". The volcanic ash was buried in the entire 50 -acre Village of Akshiri. The subsequent earthquake and tsunami directly destroyed the 70 -mile Crete Island Minos civilization. It is said that there are also records related to this eruption in Chinese history books. At that time, it was about the period of the Emperor Emperor in the end of the summer. The record of the earthquake in "Bamboo Book Years": "Five stars are wrong. In the night, the star meteors are like rain, Yi, Luo, and summer died." It even hinted that this eruption indirectly caused indirectly leading to the indirect cause of the eruption. The rivers of Yishui and Luoshui in Henan, therefore caused the replacement of Xia Shangchao.

The wild peacock, who had been lingering on the ruins of the Kanoshos Palace for a long time, suddenly opened the screen towards us and pulled me back to my eyes. Cinos four thousand years ago was the oldest city in Europe. At that time, Athens had to tribute to Crete Island. born. The colonnade of the red lacquer "made old" today was reconstructed by British archeologist Arthur Evans in the early 20th century. In this way, the way to imitate the most elegant palace in Europe from 2600-1100 BC is still a major controversy in the archeological industry.

However, for us, the most charming is the semi -real and semi -legend. How to interpret it can be left to ourselves. You see, King Minos is the son of Zeus and Europa in the legend. In my opinion, the twists and turns of the gallery of 20,000 square meters of palace monuments may be inspired by King Minos or the "maze" myth of the "maze" myth; in other words, the palace itself may be the "maze".

Artists appear more in the public's field of vision, after the rise of social media.

With the increase of biography, art history, interviews, or gossip in the Internet community, people have re -understood many past events through these poles that embody intimate friendship. Art is a kind of difficulty to interpret it. It is like artists who are talking about global now. They will always talk about his or her skin color and more detailed past to him or her work. The good words of heroes between the old -fashioned artists seemed to have ended in Freud or Bacon. The old -fashioned works left a deep impression on us, and in the process of changing the style of artistic creation, they influenced each other subtly. Let's attract the main condiments of the eyeball.

Friends who are artists seem to be easier than friends who are art. The exhibition "Friends of Art" held at the Shanghai Oil Tank Art Center last weekend made young people who love art swarming, because they are more curious about art friends than art.

Friends in theArts is even referred to as "Fita" on various social media. More often they appear in the community's cultural and artistic activities, release everyone's creativity, release everyone's enthusiasm for art, and transform For successful career. More often, Fita is more like a bridge. Through professional talent institutions, worldwide display space or cultural plane media, social media platforms, and collaborative communities, thereby promoting the diversity and sustainable development and innovation of the art industry. What's more important is to connect to cultural agents or organizations to achieve such goals together.

The exhibition of the oil tank art center is a retrospective exhibition that can go back to artists, curator, gallery owner, collector, and curator of the art museum. People are full of interest in how to dig into the development of mainstream artists in the future, and at the same time, they are also interested in their judgment of the value of the work. The value of art is unreasonable and pure desire index, and desire is the most difficult to capture and the most difficult to grasp.

These new -generation collectors who are active in the contemporary art world, and their works in the past three years are all showing their unique interests and business visions that they have observed artists around the world and different media creations. This is undoubtedly a very tolerant exhibition. A total of 30 artists collected by 32 collectors are displayed, most of which are medium -sized works. The works of these artists from all over the world are allegedly discovered and collected by collectors during the three years of the epidemic. It can be seen that some of the famous works on display have appeared in the auction activities of the past few years and various pre -exhibitions. This is a recovery process that requires the time length of the time length.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T15-28-06-00-00/000187325_piclink.jpg)Works: "Marquee", 2011, milky white acrylic glass, neon lights, light bulbs, lighting device, DMX playback, artist: Philippeparreno, the picture is provided by the artist and Hong Kong PHD GROUP gallery.

Different from the previous exhibitions, the artists who exhibited the works did not come to the stage for the exhibition platform, and the guests who appeared at the opening ceremony were collectors himself. They were friends of art, and they were also friends of capital. In the process of establishing his own career, creativity is a kind of cooperation efforts. In this effort, the role of collectors should be the artist's closing door. As an artist, they are eager to understand what the collectors who want to collect their works, or where they are, what they live in, and how many budget they have. The benefits of the world today are because we are in an online era. Everyone and every artist have the opportunity to meet their audience through different social media channels. In this regard, musicians seem to be better than artists. Of course, the works of musicians need a broader mass foundation than the artist's works.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T15-28-06-00-00/000187323_piclink.jpg)Work: "Change the Obvious Into Another Object that AlsatisFies the Rule", 2021, artist: Gabriel Rico, coin and wood. Art gallery

Among the 32 exhibits, we saw the work of Philip Parreno, which had been a solo exhibition in the Shanghai Bund Art Museum in 2017, and the work of Gabriel Ricok, which was exhibited in Behoho, "Changethe Obvious Into Another Object that Also SatisFies Theerule", this limited edition sculpture work like a pink meat intestine reflects the relationship between mankind and nature. It is very interesting that in another exhibition hall of the oil tank art center, the exhibition "Bobo Ka Ka" by the artist Xu Mao Mao is also in progress. The huge new paintings are colorful acrylic inkjet works, those large and small eyes And the sausage double -headed breasts also have a picture of various faces, allowing the audience to feel a soft style of Q bombs. The light and free atmosphere is overflowing in the afternoon space of heavy rain.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T15-28-06-00-00/000187322_piclink.jpg)Works: "Joanne", 2016, artist: Simon Fujiwara, independent light box, video projection, Courtesy of theLinyao kiki liu, support by Esther Schipper, Berlin/Paris/Seoul/SeoulIn a sense, this work explores the deep -rooted identity construction mechanism between individuals and society. And before I understand this creative background, I put the photos of these works in my circle of friends. Friends who do n’t understand the story after the story will leave a message and say that the work will become artwork? At the time, I felt that if the work was enlarged, it should become the street sign of the movie "Three Billboards". After understanding the story behind the creation, the audience has indeed made a new understanding of the role of the media.

Data show that the total number of Chinese art applications in 2020 has reached 1.17 million, while the proportion of candidates in art is 53%. So many people want to choose art as a profession, and the possibility of becoming an artist is very small. Artists, in the end, embrace art, and how many opportunities to be embraced by artists? It's like an emotional relationship. Even if there is no hope, a person can keep it in his heart for a long time. Even if life blows it every day, he can't blow it out ... Ji De described love like this, in fact, for art, for art, in fact, for art, it is artistic. In fact, it is artistic. Why isn't pursuit not like this with infinite loneliness and infinite bitter love story?

In the noisy and casual art boom, the Shanghai Oil Art Center will also launch more collectors exhibitions in the second issue in November this year. Artists, artists, collectors, galleries, and art museums. They are all looking for With the goal of your expectations, or the manifestation of the taste and thought of the art manager, or the taste and visibility of the art investors, or the creativity of the artists. In short, before discovering, promoting, and explaining artists at various textbook -levels, the door was narrow.

![](Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-07-13T15-28-06-00-00/000187326_piclink.jpg)Works: "Silvery Flower Locked in theHummock", 2022, artist: Zhang Yongbei, bronze, picture provided by the artist and Spurs gallery.

Some people may say that this is an exhibition symbolizing capital power. But is art like an uncertainty, is it because of more and more hot money, and it will grow many outstanding works or great artists? The answer is obviously uncertain. After all, this spring, the sales of Christie's and Sotheby's sales are slowly slowed. Although the economic recession has not dragged everything, the experienced collectors choose not to invest their arts into an uncertain economic turbulence. So this year's art auction market is not as dazzling as imagined.

German Foreign Minister Annalenabaerbock also said in his speech on Thursday that "China is still a partner, competitors and systemic opponents, but the side of systematic competition has become increasingly prominent in recent years."

Comprehensive foreign news reports, this 64 -page "China Strategy" is based on the first German national security strategy released a month ago, and echoed the EU's economic security strategy. The document emphasizes that there is "systemic competition" in Germany and China, which needs to reduce the risk of economic dependence.

Foreign Minister Bell Berk's speech at the Merics Research Center of the Berlin Think Tank also pointed out that in terms of economic security, Germany did not want to repeat the mistakes made before the Russian and Ukraine War: "We experienced unilaterally last year, unilaterally experienced unilateral sides last year.

![](Images/rfamandarin/2023-07-13T15-54-31-04-00/000000.png)The first China -Central Asia Summit has been held in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province on May 19, 2023

** Moderator: Chen Kuide **

** Senator: Professor Xia Yeliang, economists and political critics **

****

Everyone may have noticed that in recent months, in the Russia -Ukraine War, in the relationship between China and the United States and Russia, especially after the Wagner mutiny, there have been some subtle changes. In particular, NATO countries have begun to discuss the European political territory after the Russia and Ukraine, the economic reconstruction of Ukraine, and whether Ukraine, Sweden and other countries have joined NATO. The Chinese authorities have also undergone some subtle changes to the Russian and U -Wars' adjustments. There seems to be some new signs of the three sides of China and the United States and Russia. This has made us interested in tracking the historical evolution of the three -sided relationship between the United States and China and the Russia and the ins and outs of its ins and out. Look at the historical evolution of this three -sided relationship since the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in the last century.

** 1. Historical background **

** 1) Version 1.0 of the United States, China and the Soviet Union: Falling the Soviet Union **

In 1949, the Civil War of the Communist Party of China succeeded and seized the regime. Mao adopted the foreign policy of **, and signed the "Sino -Soviet Friendship Cooperation and Mutual Aid Treaty" with Stalin's Soviet Union. The UN force's blockage of the invaders North Korea used the blood of nearly one million Chinese youths to hand in Moscow to make a investment name, and added a socialist camp led by the Soviet Union to confront the international mainstream society. The Sino -Soviet Union was opened to fight against the US Romance 1.0.

** 2) Version of the United States, China and the Soviet Universal Performance 2.0: United States and Anti -Soviet **

After the 1960s, the Sino -Soviet division was divided, and the CCP implemented more extreme internal and external policies to fight for the Communist overlords, leading to the Great Famine and Crazy Cultural Revolution. After facing the "nuclear surgery -type surgical" strike deterrence that the Soviet Union claimed, it quickly shifted to seeking the protection of the United States. From 1972 to 1989, he entered the US -China -China quasi -alliance to fight against the Soviet Union. During the 1972-1976 period, the Chinese Communist Party's internal affairs left and diplomatically turned to the West. During the 1978-1989 period, the internal affairs and diplomacy all moved to ease. This period of Deng Hu and Zhao was a rare period in the history of the Chinese Communist Party.

** 3) Version of the United States and China Romance 3.0: United Russia Anti -US **

In 1989, the Tiananmen incident in China was bloody by the Chinese Communist Party, and then the color change of socialist countries in Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Facing the defeat of socialism, Deng Xiaoping adopted the policy of hiding and continued to open the West to the West, which led the CCP to continue the diplomatic direction and economic reform of the 1980s. Economic take off. However, after Xi Jinping took power in 2013, in the face of the fading of red China, do n’t ask the surname of the family surname, it ’s distressed, and the wealth of wealth and wealth. , Implement the United States anti -US policy, rivals on all sides, China ’s diplomacy is isolated, and the economy has fallen sharply.

** 2. ** ** China and Russia jointly fight against the United States, each behind the United States **

**

Since the new crown epidemic in Wuhan broke out in Wuhan in China in 2020, major Western countries have become tougher than China. In the past three years, under the strategic leadership of the United States India, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia have been built. The encirclement circle, the southern seas of the South China Sea, and the Indian enclosure circle in the west. There are layers of defense and ambush on all sides. Under this harsh geopolitics and military siege, Beijing had to catch Moscow to further move closer to Putin, a hostile leader with hostile international systems. "Friend", Xi Pu met at the 2022 Winter Olympics, and Beijing said that China and Russia would not be capped.

Not a few days after Xi Pu's meeting, Putin launched a war against Ukraine, and Xi Jinping was tied to his chariot. He has guarded Putin for shortness in diplomacy and does not condemn Russia's aggression. In the voting of the United Nations about the Russian and Ukraine War, most of the country's intentions were rebelled and voted for abandonment. The war reserved diplomacy and military aid. At the same time, when Russia encountered severe economic sanctions in the West, he increased economic assistance to Russia.

However, the world was unpredictable that the Russian and Ukraine War was beyond the idea of universal. The war has been more than one year, and the situation is increasingly unfavorable. In Beijing, Mao Sui recommended to play the role of peace -mediated persons, and propagating the ceasefire on the spot. In fact, Russia has maintained the current situation of Russia in the name of peace.

Xi sent a special envoy Li Hui to lobby Europe and the United States. It is called the mediation. It is a glimpse of the bottom line of all parties. The more important mission is to detect the virtual and real and evaluate the war trend of the war.

From the perspective of post -development, Li Hui reported the evaluation of the Russian and Ukraine war on Xi Jinping, which was not good for Putin.

** _wagner soldiers' shock to Beijing_ **

The Russian Wagner's soldiers suddenly rose and became the last straw on the back of Xi Jinping's camel.

Before Porigo and Belarus President Lukashenko reached a Wagner armed forces to stop advancing to Moscow, Putin gave Belarus President Lukashenko, Uzbekistan President Milzyev, Kazakhstan President Takayev, and Turkish President Erdogan called. At the same time, North Korea Kim Jong -un also called Putin to express his support for Russia, but he did not call Xi Jinping, and Xi did not call Putin to express his support.

This is very different from North Korea, Turkey and other countries.

In the dozens of hours from June 24th to 26th, Beijing has been silent. It is not difficult to imagine that Xi Jinping was shocked and couldn't sleep all night.

Only after the Wagner armed forces stopped advancing to Moscow, Beijing issued a careful statement of wording. It was nothing more than saying that the incident was Russia's internal affairs and China supported Russia to stabilize.

?

On June 28, the representative of China in Europe, Fu Cong, delivered a speech, claiming that China had no reason not to support Ukraine's boundary in 1991, that is, Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea was legal. This is a major change in Beijing's diplomatic position.

This shows that Beijing's ending of the Russian and Ukraine has already had its answer.

This is not groundless, it has long been able to follow:

** _Euravity and Russia reached out into the other party's "sphere of power" _ **

From May 18th to 19th, China held the China-Central Asian Summit in Xi'an. The five Central Asian countries are: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. These countries are members of the SCO. The country is the former Soviet Union's joining republic, which belongs to Russia's sphere of influence. Beijing had a suffering in Moscow while digging the wall in Beijing.Judging from the previous overbearing behavior of the Communist Party of China, leaving what the South China Sea Conference to hold in Beijing, it is intended to resolve the South China Sea dispute.

However, although he was dissatisfied, Beijing could not bear it, and the official did not blame Russia publicly. Beijing only expresses the disagreement of Russian practices through some folk articles. After all, the Central Asian Summit led by Beijing in May also put aside Russia. Come and not be polite.

So why do Russia leave Beijing's convening of the South China Sea Conference? What is Russia's attitude towards the South China Sea?

In October 2021, Xi Jinping's speech held at the 110th anniversary of the 1911 Revolution held by Xi Jinping released a strong signal to unify Taiwan.

The United States stated that the United States' commitment to Taiwan is still "strong as rock", as always, without vague.

At that time, Putin said in an interview with the American media CNBC anchor Gandebul in Moscow: "... ** We must provide an opportunity in the region under the intervention of the regional power, and we must provide appropriate dialogue in accordance with the basic guidelines of international law. "If people still remember what Putin's past said in the United States and China, he would take the position of watching the hills and watching the tiger. Here he criticized the signal of China's intervention is quite clear.

**

** RMB suffered double pinch **

The renminbi has recently depreciated, and the depreciation of the offshore RMB.

It is noted that Russia is selling RMB crazy. In June, Russia sold about 3.3 billion yuan to exchange for about 4.5 billion US dollars. This self -interesting behavior accelerated the speed of the RMB depreciation.

Why does Russia sell RMB almost crazy?

The main reason for selling is to pay for military expenses. Some Western institutions predict that Russia's monthly expenditure spending will take about 15 billion to 18 billion US dollars. However, because most Russian foreign exchange reserves were frozen by the West, soldiers' salaries (Wagner did not collect), equipment maintenance, etc. cannot be used in RMB, so they sell a large number of RMB for US dollars.

As a part of the official measures that prevent the depreciation of the yuan and excessively large, the People's Bank of China has set the interest rate guidance rate that is stronger than expected. Chinese state -owned banks have sold the US dollar after the shore and offshore market trends, and It shows that Beijing's depreciation of the RMB acceleration is increasingly disturbed.

But Russia has accelerated the selling RMB. According to statistics, in the past year, Putin has sold US $ 4.5 billion in RMB, and Russia's holding RMB reserves has decreased by one -thirds. This is the largest sales of RMB in Russia in recent years.

Earlier, the Russian Central Bank issued a report alarm that bluntly said that the RMB could not be freely converted, and lacked hedge tools, and there was a risk of trade settlement in RMB ... After the Russian and Ukraine War broke out, China and Russia rose to the Russian trade. Outside, there is no other use, so the Russian central bank continues to sell RMB this year to buy US dollars and euros.

Therefore, the depreciation of this wave of renminbi is obviously "reflected" by the internationalization of the RMB. Due to the Sino -Russian currency swap agreement, Beijing has been damaged on both sides.

First, Russia holds a lot of RMB to Hong Kong to exchange US dollars at any time, causing the RMB to leak. After Russia replaced the US dollar with RMB, the US dollar maintained the ruble exchange rate.

Second, China has been replaced with RMB and holds too many rubles. Since this year, these rubles have depreciated by about 30%. In addition, rubles have been sanctioned, and it is difficult to circulate in the international market. The rubles held by China have gradually become waste paper.

The internationalization of the renminbi has caused double pinch, which has opened the process of depreciation.

** China Restrictions Export ** ** Russia immediately announced the increase in production 镓锗 **

China restricts the export to counterattack Biden, Russia announced its increase in production and supplement the market gap.

In order to counterattack Biden's joint allies to restrict the development of Chinese semiconductors, Beijing announced export control for "镓" and "锗" for manufacturing semiconductors and other electronic products. Putin immediately turned his hand, and Russia announced the increase in production to fill the market gap. The Chinese media was angry, and bluntly proved that "the amount of Sino -Russian relations is not high in gold."

The Ministry of Commerce of China announced on July 3 that after the implementation of export controls on key materials and 锗 of the key materials and 锗 of the semiconductor, it was only 2 days after the export control. After China announced that it is restricted to the export of metal manufacturing for chips, Russia is preparing to increase the output of crickets to meet domestic demand. In addition, Russia also has manufacturers preparing to increase production.

Regarding Russia's decision, China media stated that Rostec claimed that increasing production was only to meet the domestic demand in Russia, and it was obviously "blatantly lied." (Because the global yield of the world is about 130 tons, China ’s exports account for 60 %, most of which are eaten by the optical and semiconductor industry chain in East Asia. The output is minimal.) Russia produces so much. There is no second possibility except for export.

Experts from all parties have pointed out that Russia obviously not only meets "domestic demand", and in accordance with China's export control of 镓 and 锗, it immediately announces to increase exports. The market panicked and stabbed behind Beijing.

_ ** Xi Jinping received Biden's warning ** **? ** _

Recent Essence ** Bynden broke the news that Xi Jinping did not say a word at the time, and then Ben Deng noticed that Xi did not go all out to Russia.

_ (In that call, Biden told Xi Jinping that since Russia entered Ukraine, 600__ home American companies have withdrawn from Russia. Biden said to Xi Jinping: "This is not a threat. This is an observation." Bayon also. Said, I told Xi Jinping that China's economy depends on investment in Europe and the United States. So be careful!Be careful!When asked about Xi Jinping's response at the time, Biden said, "He listen, and he has no ... ..__ Content_ _ "." Also, if you noticed, he did not go all out to Russia. "

Regardless of what Biden's warning caused what reaction was caused by Xi's heart, Xi Jinping obviously saw Putin's slump presented in the Wagner incident, and at the same time, he also saw the sluggishness of the Chinese economy. Needless to say, he has realized that the diplomatic policy must be adjusted, and Xi's hesitation, cautious and restrained response to the Wagner incident. Beijing has determined that the Russia -Ukraine War and Russia will fail, so they must plan ahead.

And fast, you must compete with Russia.

This means that the Sino -Russian relations that are not capped on the top have already touched.

** III, Sino -Russian relations break the silk, the American and China Romance Romance ** ** 4.0 version has been on the road **

** Sino -Russian relations break the silk company ** **

However, Xi Jinping is currently unable to completely abandon Putin. He has invested too much in this relationship, and Russia is still useful to China. Although China may be forced to adjust its position in the Ukrainian war. But given the factors of historical hostess, this turning point will face some huge resistance.China is now aware that Ukraine's long -lasting war may fundamentally damage Russia's partner country and damage China's own foreign policy agenda. China has a reason to go further in the previously vague expression of the war, and uses its unique influence on Russia to urge the realization of the armistice (it must cause it to persuade Moscow to abandon Crimea, which is a very difficult task).

** Europe is the key **

One key reason for this situation is Europe, where China is damaged by supporting Russia. The European business community has deteriorated in China, and foreign direct investment has slowed down, and the coordination of the two sides of the Atlantic has strengthened its coordination on China.

Xi Jinping must resolutely weaken the United States to curb China's efforts. A hostile Europe will make him face difficulties. Russia's isolation has put pressure on China and allows it to improve European relations to prevent Europe from uniting to fight against China. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to find a clearer re -positioning and play the role of peaceful creators at the Russian and Ukraine War at the door of the European home.

But even if it is alienated to Russia, it is difficult to gain trust.

** Taiwan, take the lead and move the whole body **

Russia's issue has also made Xi Jinping's planning on Taiwan's issues complicated. The Ukrainian war shows two things: it is not possible to win the battle by relying on military forces; but not winning the battle may lead to the challenge of the power of the leadership. Faced with these situations, the launch of the Taiwan Strait War may be disastrous for Xi Jinping.

Taiwan will hold the presidential election in January next year to choose Cai Yingwen's successor. Tsai Ing -wen annoyed Beijing because of getting closer and closer to the United States. China is obviously using a series of means to apply economic pressure and public opinion pressure in Taiwan, or to spread error information to support candidates who have improved the relationship with Beijing.

However, the aggressive speech of the Chinese side and the threat of military exercises around Taiwan may be counterproductive. Not only will it not only make the candidates who oppose China stronger, but also stimulate the stronger and clear support of the United States and the international community for Taiwan. For Xi Jinping, the best balance point is to show a tough and firm position while not leading to the continuous upgrade of the situation.

** Diplomacy turning momentum is bound to do **

In view of all these changes, although Xi Jinping was unwilling to be reluctant, he also realized that he must ease the tension with the United States. The needs of both the United States and China have contributed to the visiting of Brinken and Yellen. However, Xi must make a proud and indifferent appearance to meet the needs of Da internal propaganda.

Xi Jinping still needs his "close friend". If the role of human rights and democratic governance in the international system, Russia is still the only country that has the ability and motivation to cooperate with China on this issue. Stable relationships will also ensure the stability of the long land boundary between the two countries and allow China to obtain Russia's energy, imported food and military equipment at preferential prices. And Russia, because it is still in the torment of war, is more demanding in China. Therefore, in terms of face, it is expected that the two countries will maintain all the usual appearances. However, major changes will be undergone in the future.

** Four, forward -looking: Two partners work together to combat common enemies, and in secret, whoever shakes hands with the enemy first **

** The geopolitical situation in front of a Jiazi reappears **

The current subtle relationship between the three sides of the United States, China and Russia seems to have returned to the US -Soviet -China -China three -sided relationship in the United States and the Soviet Union 60 years ago (the 1960s of the last century). However, the current China and Russia are compared with China and the Soviet Union. At that time, Su Qiang was weak, but now it is Zhongqiang Russia, and his status is upside down.

In the 1960s, in the Cold War against the socialist camp of NATO, China and the Soviet Union began to split, and there was a big discussion. Even the border (Treasure Island) armed conflict occurred. Nuclear military bases performed surgical removal of surgery, and were later stopped by the external enemy of both sides. Since then, it is China and the United States secretly sending Qiubo. In 1971, Kisinsin visited China in secret. In 1972, President Nixon's visit to China, which led to a major change in global political territory, especially in the United States, China, the Soviet Union: China -Soviet Union ** ** vs. ** ** The United States ** The transformation of the United States to ** US -China Public League vs. ** ** Soviet Union **

** Who can shake hands with the United States first? **

The current situation of the Grand Triangle, although it is the ** China -Russian quasi -alliance ** ** vs. ** ** US ** **, **, but as mentioned above, the relationship between the Sino -Russian quasi -alliance is increasingly vulnerable and caused by long -term national interests The separation of separation is supporting the personal relationship between Xi Jinping and Putin. Once Russia and Ukraine signed a peace agreement, Russia is likely to fall to the United States and the West. At present, China and Russia are on the surface, and the United States and the West are on the surface, but they actually have channels to interoperate with the United States and Europe.

Under the current situation of the Sino -Russian quasi -alliance vs. US, what people do not need to be surprised is that it is likely that both Chinese and Russian partners even run each other in secret to see who can shake hands with the enemy in the West.

At present, because the Russian war is still ongoing, the West still regards Russia as the primary threat at the moment; however, everyone is considering post -war matters. In the triangular relations between the country, the first strong and the second strongest are naturally hostile, so the third is the object that both sides must win. After the war, Russia must be the third child, just as China was the third child during the Cold War. Therefore, the boss intended to join forces after the war, and the situation was clear. In fact, it can be seen from the United States that is currently controlling the intensity of the Russian and Ukraine war and the speed of Ukraine to join NATO.

At present, China and Russia have publicly resisted the United States. At the same time, they quietly linked to the United States in the audience, especially before the other party. A complicated diplomatic interaction of the Three Kingdoms is below.

Description: (AFP, San Francisco, 13th) A sea otter that has a bizarre harassing rushing in the California coast of the United States.

![](Images/rficn/2023-07-13T16-02-08-00-00/000000.png)Santacruz, about 90 minutes of drive in the south of San Francisco, the wildlife authorities have actually posted to warn the public to be careful about the 5 -year -old motherly sea otter. It has been harassing the waves for several weeks, but the recent attack has risen to a new height.

According to an amazing film posted on the Internet on the 10th, this sea otter climbed up to a surfingboard of a surfer, and when the surflers tried to shake and flip the surfboard, it tightly grabbed the board and rushed towards it for a time. The waves started to bite the board and refused to stop.

Joon Lee, who was attacked by a sea otter on the 9th, told the Los Angelestims that he was scared at the time. "I tried to swim, but I bite my (surfboard) foot rope before you could swim away, and let me panic."

The authorities have issued a detailed notice to the mother sea otter. The US Fish and WildlifeService said in a statement: "In view of the rise in public safety risks, a group of California Fish and Wildlife Department (CDFW) and Monterey (Monterey Bayaquarium), personnel who have been captured and handled with sea otter training, try to capture and resett it. "

In the past, the United States Pioneer hunted the sea otter for the fur. It did not stop until the beginning of the 20th century, but the number of sea otters has been reduced to almost extinction. Now the sea otters are still endangered, but the number has risen. It is currently believed that there are about 3,000 in the North Pacific waters.

Although the surfers, canoe enthusiasts and sailing athletes rarely meet sea otters at sea, they have not heard of it. Because the sea otter saw that their small heads came out of the water, sometimes they still felt that they were cute.

However, sea otters are actually aggressive predators, and their bite is dangerous. Having said that, the mother sea otter was still unusual on the coast of St. Cruise. Experts were so incredible why it was so aggressive.

Local scientists recognize this mother sea otter. According to the New York Times, its mother gave birth to it after being arrested by humans, because it was often fed that they had lost their fear of humanity.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T16-53-24/1-1689262783.png)German Prime Minister Tsugs attended the weekly cabinet meeting (Reuters) held in Berlin (Reuters)

German Prime Minister Tsugs said that Germany has released a new policy to cope with more "confident" China. Previously, he had a fierce discussion on how to treat Berlin's largest trading partner for several months.

After the new strategy was announced on Thursday, Shuoerz said, "Our goal is not to be decoupled with Beijing, but we hope to reduce the key dependence in the future," he said. This strategy "is a change that has changed. And become more confident in China. "

German Foreign Minister of Foreign Minister Anna Lena Bell Berbak said the government said that the policy would be included in the EU's policy to China and aims to "reality but not naive."

This document is the product of the German government for several months on its strategic debate against China.

Although the Green Party's Berbak promotes a stronger route to Beijing and pays more attention to human rights, Social Democratic Democratic support is more conducive to trade positions.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T16-53-24/1-1689262848.jpg)Does German trade rely too much on China?

The new policy of China marks the subtle balance between the two internal government, calling Beijing as "partners, competitors, and systemic competitors."

The document said, "China is the largest single trading partner in Germany, but despite China's dependence on Europe, Germany's dependence on China has become more important in recent years."

The government said it had no intention of "hindering China's economic progress and development."

The German government said, "At the same time, it is urgent to go to risk."

#### International Order

Berlin "is concerned about how China strives to influence international order in order to comply with the interests of its one -party system, so as to relative the foundation of rules -based international order, such as human rights status."

In the first national security strategy announced by Germany last month, China's behavior also accused China's behavior that harmed the interests of Germany, causing international security to "bears more and more stress" and ignore human rights.

A report from German intelligence agencies also regards China as "the biggest threat in German economic and scientific spy activities and foreign direct investment."

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T16-53-24/2-1689262884.jpg)Will the German security strategy work?

The tough route shocked Beijing, but it also caused concerns about China's increasingly dependent German industry.

In recent months, Volkswagen and Siemens have formulated a growth strategy that has seriously relying on the Chinese market.

On Thursday, Volkswagen's chief operating officer Lalff Bravztart(Ralf Brandstaetter)Welcome to the political goals of the New China strategy. He said that "strengthening our own status ... reducing one -sided economic dependence and creating incentives for more diversification."

The person in charge of this German automobile manufacturer in China stated in a statement: "We have not naively regarded China that has become an economic superpower that China has become."

He added that in order to minimize geopolitical risks, Germany must "reduce dependence and strengthen our status in other regions" and "create independent controlling value chains."

#### "Risk"

Tsutz emphasized that Germany "does not want to be decoupled, we want to risk."

However, he emphasized the diversification of Berlin to realize the diversification of trading partners and said that Germany "committed to actively expanding economic relations with Asia and other regions.

![](Images/Aljazeera Chinese/2023-07-13T16-53-24/1-1689262912.jpg)Germany and China hold meetings in the tension between trade and Ukraine

After the US economic policy is tightened, Beijing's greatest EU partners may go in the same direction and use the seemingly goodwill "risk" remarks to gradually leave the Asian economy.

The Chinese State Council's Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Germany last month. This is his first visit since he took office in the Chinese Prime Minister. He also emphasized that as the EU's criticism sound became louder, Beijing attaches more importance to improving the relationship with the EU.

However, he warned Berlin not to "use the risks to decume", and asked Chinese companies to provide a "fair competitive environment".

The picture shows the trademark of the "Four" accounting firms. Network screenshot

The Wall Street Journal of the United States stated on Thursday that since this year, Xi Jinping has launched the National Security Amber, and any foreign company's investment in China has become a potential minefield, which will hinder China's economic recovery.

This article entitled "Xi Jinping's pressure on foreign companies to extinguish the key engine of the Chinese economy" stated that the Chinese government launched the "Investment of the Year of the Chinese Year" this year. Local government officials started publicity activities to overseas to attract foreign capital. But these efforts hit Xi Jinping's national security agenda.

Since this year, in the maintenance of the national security campaign led by Xi Jinping, Western management consultants, audit companies and other institutions have encountered assault search and detention operations. At the same time, the expansion of the anti -espionage law has made foreign executives more worried, and conventional business activities such as market research in China may be regarded as "spy activities".

The article said that for Chinese leaders, on the one hand, it should be pressured to foreign companies, and at the same time strive to attract these enterprises to invest. In this way, trying to balance risks, it may also cause China to lose its capital, technology, and management skills to help its development. This tug -of -war made the debt quagmire through 3 years of epidemic prevention in China, and it was difficult to create employment opportunities and urgently needed cities to suffer.

The article quoted a number of surveys that many US and European companies have recently decided to reduce investment in China or suspend funds to increase capital. Cameronjohnson, the person in charge of the consulting company Tidal Wave Solution, said the uncertainty of Chinese policies has led to the decision -making level of global companies.

The Thai Congress was elected as the new Prime Minister, and the leader and the prime minister candidate failed to obtain enough voting. It is expected that a new round of voting will be held next week to vote for new prime ministers.

The Thai Congress held a joint meeting of the two united conferences on Thursday (7th). The Tower was the only nominated Prime Minister candidate on the day.

The Eight Party Leaders led by the Party controlled 312 of the 500 seats in the house. As a senator Renutunkachivangoon submitted his resignation on the eve of the parliament, the total number of senators was reduced to 249. To be the Prime Minister of the Tower, he must receive more than half of the 749 seats (375 votes) of the upper and lower courtyards, and he is still 63 votes.

According to the results of the day, the Tower received 324 support votes, and 182 votes were opposed and 199 abstained. The distance between the pagoda is 51 tickets.

After the Parliament ended on Thursday, he said that he accepted the results of this voting, but it showed that he would "not give up" to continue to chase the road of any phase. He said that the APM Party will re -develop a strategy in order to win sufficient support in the next round of voting.

He said that there were a lot of pressure from the House of Councils because there were a lot of members who were absent from voting that day. More than 30 more than 30 members were absent from this vote.

He also said that the councilors "have some incentives in the face of pressure", but did not further explain. "They are not allowed to follow the wishes of the people ... I thank the 13 members of my support votes."

The pagoda and the Qianjin Party have repeatedly adhered to the law of the offense of the monarchy, becoming the biggest controversial point for whether the pagoda should be the new Prime Minister in Parliament.

Due to the failure to get enough support for the votes this time, Congress is expected to hold a joint meeting again next week, and the alliance led by the advanced party can repeatedly nominate the pagoda.

After several months of fierce debate, Germany outlines possible response measures in the China Strategy to China, such as implementing foreign investment control on cutting -edge technologies with military purposes to cope with China that is "tougher" and reduce the relationship between the two countries. Risks.

Comprehensive Reuters and Agence France -Presse reported that Germany stated in the 64 -page long -page strategy document on Thursday (July 13) in Germany: "China has changed. Because of this with China's political decision, we need to change our attitude towards China . "After several months of argument with the three -party league of German Prime Minister, this document was consent from the cabinet on the same day.

After the strategy was released, German Chancellor Anti -German Prime Minister Tzu said that Germany did not intend to decompose with China, "but we hope to reduce the key dependence in the future."

The document said that China is still an indispensable partner in response to global challenges such as climate change and great popularity. However, the document pointed out that China is becoming more and more tough in trying to change the rules -based international order, which has a impact on global security. According to the article, China has decided to expand its relationship with Russia, which has a direct security impact on Germany.

German Foreign Minister Berbak sent a tweet that Germany must reduce the risk of relations with China. "We want to cooperate with China. Because we need China, China also needs us in Europe." But she added that Germany also invested in other international partnerships.

It also said to China strategy documents that Germany will continue to strengthen its military existence in the Indo -Pacific region and cooperate with partners, and warn that the status quo of the Taiwan Strait can only change through peaceful means and the consent of both parties.

The document also states that because China supports Russia, China is not credible in defending the integrity of Ukraine's territory, and urges Beijing to take a clearer position on Russia's invasion.

A spokesman for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that in the next few weeks and months, the German government will discuss new strategies for China at all levels with the Chinese government. The spokesman said it was translating the document into Chinese.

A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Germany mentioned in the response to Germany's strategy to China that many challenges and problems currently facing Germany are not caused by China. China is a partner for Germany to deal with challenges, not opponents. Considering China as "competitors and institutional opponents" does not meet the objective facts and does not meet the common interests of the two countries. Looking at China and the formulation of China's strategy for China will only exacerbate misunderstandings and misjudgments, damage the cooperation and mutual trust of both parties.
