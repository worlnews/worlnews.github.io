<p><strong> "Don't just forget it, okay? Many things can't be counted like this. If this is the case, people will slowly die and die!" This is a TV that became popular in Taiwan last month. The classic lines in the album "Candidates: Creator" came from an opposition female leader that the party workers of the opposition party told the grassroots party workers that they were willing to appeal with the latter in an interior party to encounter sexual harassment. </strong></p>
<p>After the film was broadcast on the international streaming platform, it became popular in Taiwan. At that time, the major political party staff members, including Taiwan President Tsai Ing -wen and the DPP presidential candidate Lai Qingde, all mentioned the success of the film production.</p>
<p>However, no one thought at the time that this set of popular albums of the DPP's political aids as screenwriters predicted the "sexual harassment" of Taiwan's political (including parties) to accuse the tsunami strike.</p>
<p>Related real -name accusations began to appear within the DPP. After that, senior media people accused the Kuomintang's Democratic harassment. The issue of sexual harassment became an unexpected storm shortly after the presidential election of Taiwan's presidential election.</p>
<p>However, the dispute has also been extended to the academic and literary circles. In the past few days, the accused, including the "June 4th" democratic movement Wang Dan, who is a guest assistant professor at Tsinghua University, Taiwan, and Beiling, an exile writer who visited Taiwan in Taiwan. But both have denied the relevant allegations.</p>
<p>Other cases include associate professors of Taiwan Chung Kyoga University, professor at the National Taiwan University Hospital, President of the People's Party, Ke Wenzhe, a former courage, Kuomintang think tank scholar, documentary director and senior local newspaper senior management.</p>
<p>Most of these charges have denied relevant allegations and claimed to be willing to clarify judicial channels. BBC Chinese cannot independently verify related allegations.</p>

<p>Taipei MRT.</p>
<p>Last week, Chen Yan, a grass -roots party worker who worked as a DPP of the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party, accused the real -name "Facebook". When he worked in a election campaign last year, he encountered sexual harassment in the workplace. She said that although the Women's Ministry in the party was immediately notified (now the Ministry of Gender Equality), she claimed that the senior female supervisor of women's movement was improperly treated and secondary injuries. She said that after watching the TV series, her mood collapsed again, but she was publicly public, hoping that the party would still reform.</p>
<p>The woman surnamed Chen quickly discussed in Taiwan's politics. The next day, another former party worker named by the Democratic Progressive Party pointed out that he had encountered sexual harassment in the workplace of colleagues in the party. The woman posted a post, but after the report was reported to the supervisor, they encountered the latter despise, and after joining the harm to the harm, they had a problem with the mental health and then left. The woman named Chen also complained that at the time, the witnesses at the scene were rarely reached out.</p>
<p>After the two articles were issued, the public opinion of Taiwan ’s public opinion was uproar. The DPP faced the storm in the party. Taiwan’ s President Tsai Ing -wen issued an apology. In addition to the apology, the DPP, also known as the DPP will completely reform.</p>
<p>Lai Qingde proposed a three -point innovation plan on Monday (June 5), including the establishment of a direct appeal window, the principles of zero tolerance, and immediately revising the party's rules. Li Yanrong, director of the Democratic Progressive Party, set up an appeal mailbox saying that only she could read the mailbox and encouraged the victims to file a appeal.</p>
<p>The issue of sexual harassment became an unexpected political storm when the Taiwan presidential election officially started in 2024. The focus of public opinion in Taiwan is the first to the DPP -the party has promoted many women's participation in politics and marriage equality. Now how will it completely reform and respond to the outside world, especially the young generation.</p>
<p>Observing the crisis of sexual harassment allegations involved in the Democratic Progressive Party, Li Dingzan, a retired professor of the Sociology Institute of Tsinghua University in Taiwan, posted on Facebook that "the DPP has attaches importance to disadvantaged and a few, which is an important core value of the party." However, in recent years, President Tsai Ing -wen has particularly focused on Guoan and the economy, and the marginalization of core values. Many social, cultural and educational issues, "almost not in the minds of the governors. . The appearance in the Women's Department and the Youth Ministry is even more ironic, which also highlights the changes in the ruling party in recent years. "</p>
<p>Li Dingzan believes that the DPP will return to the original intention of the founding party. "And set off from here, use this incident to make a comprehensive reflection, actively take care of the disadvantaged and a few, and propose a specific policy plan in order to slowly find the lost person's heart. Come."</p>
<h3>Frequent transmission of sexual harassment cases in Taiwan</h3>
<p>In fact, in Taiwan's political circle, regardless of the position, frequent cases about sexual harassment or even sexual assault have been criticized, it has always been criticized.</p>
<p>On Tuesday (June 6), the Taipei Court judged that the KMT legislator Chen Xuesheng had a sexual harassment of the DPP legislators Fan Yun, and sentenced to a total of NT $ 80,000 of Fan Nan. The Kuomintang responded that it respects the judicial judgment but will not revoke Chen Xuesheng's qualifications to nominate the next legislature.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/202111120319.aspx">Taiwan Media</a>At the end of 2021, the current deputy mayor of Taipei City Lin Yihua used to be the legislator in the past. Lin Nan, director of the office, was also suspected of sexual assaulting a woman. Lin Yihua and Lin Nan brought civil compensation for more than 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The woman named Zhong named Zhong who had accused the sexual harassment in the workplace in the people's party <a href="https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?Type=24&amp;SerialNo=139889">then posted on Facebook</a>When questioning the controversy of the People's Party criticized the DPP's sexual show, the attitude of allegations of allegations of her allegations, Zhong Nu said, "Have you ever thought about my feelings? Why did his party incident coming out the next day?"He said that the Kuomintang may also be reluctant to attack the DPP on this issue, because there were similar cases in the party in the past, and cases that were unwilling to be disclosed may also be. Qiu Qixin said: "Similarly, Ke Wenzhe, chairman of the people and presidential candidates, has been criticized for a long time. This has been criticized for a long time. This may also be captured by the pan -green camp."</p>
<h3>sexual harassment incident is difficult to cause?</h3>

<p>Taiwan streets.</p>
<p>Based on Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare last year <a href="https://www.mohw.gov.tw/cp-5271-70900-1.html">Statistics</a>It shows that in the past 5 years, the number of sexual harassment appeals in Taiwan has increased year by year. 96%of the victims of sexual harassment are women, and more than 60%of those under 30.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Women's Rights Group also held a press conference on "Make the victims for sexual harassment" on Monday (June 5). They quoted the "Equal Employment Survey of Working Places Employment Employment" from 2017 to 2021 that they quoted data from the "Employment Employment Employment Employment Survey" of the workplace that 70-80 % of the parties who encountered sexual harassment on the workplace chose not to appeal, which became a "silent black number" (refers to The underestimated number).</p>
<p>These groups stated that according to the current relevant regulations of Taiwan, they only mentioned that the employer's "obtaining" was introduced and counsel or medical resources to the victims, but the law did not force the employer to provide substantial assistance or services. Therefore, sexual harassment victims usually can only explore solutions alone, and most people choose to give up appeal or private.</p>
<p>Dai Jingyun, director of the Law Department of the New Knowledge Foundation of Taiwan Women's New Foundation, emphasized at a press conference that the current Taiwan's "Equality Law of Gender Work" will attribute the investigation responsibility for investigation, but if sexual harassment is an employer, it will become players and referees. A large loophole.</p>
<p>In addition, in case of the female party worker named by the Democratic Progressive Party, when the victim is a customer or partner of the employee, such as outsourcing manufacturers, it is difficult for employers to investigate or punish employers in accordance with the law. Dai Jingyun said that the current sexual harassment prevention regulations are complicated, and the public is not only difficult to understand the law, but there are often controversy in legal practice.</p>
<p>Wang Yanhao, CEO of the Taiwan Lixin Foundation, said at the press conference that according to the "Gender Violence Question A questionnaire survey" completed in 2021, 25 % of Taiwanese people will appeal to the work unit when they encounter sexual harassment in the workplace. However, 50 % of them cannot be crossed because of lack of evidence.</p>
<p>The feminist group calls on the Taiwan government to incorporate the care service mechanism of sexual harassment in the workplace as soon as possible into the "Equality Law of Gender Work", so that people who have been sexually harassed in the workplace can receive the assistance of legal consultation, psychological business, and social workers in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Russia claims that the troops of the Russian Free Legion (personnel in the picture) and the Russian Volunteer Corps were repelled and left the Russian territory.</p>
<p><strong> Russia claims to repel a warrior from the Belgorod region from Ukraine to the Belgorod in a "anti -terrorist operation". </strong></p>
<p>Russia said that the rebels involved were Ukraine's "destructives", but Ukrainian officials said they were Russian citizens and from the Russian Volunteercorps of two quasi -military organizations and Freedom of Russian Legy. Essence</p>
<p>Military analysts pointed out that the actions of the two groups may be strongly assisted by the Ukrainian armed forces and intelligence departments.</p>

<h3>What is the Russian Volunteer Corps?</h3>
<p>The Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) first appeared in March this year and participated in cross -border attacks on Bryansk, central Russia near the Ukraine border. The legion said 45 people participated.</p>
<p>The organization said that the implementation attack was to encourage the Russians to resist their government.</p>
<p>Unthically reported that the incident involved shootings, casualties, and hostage abductions. RDK said that it has not captured any hostages and has been safely withdrawn to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Members of the Russian Volunteer Corps in the border town Kojin Carlish Shadow.</p>
<p>RDK's leader claims to be Denis Kapustin, or Denis Nikitin.</p>
<p>He is a Russian nationalist, and the organization also publicly supports the Russian regime of only the Russian nation.</p>
<p>In 2020, an Ukraine investigation website accused him of being associated with the new Nazi organization. Capstine has said in the past that he is a member of the Football Rogue Sports Organization.</p>
<p>RDK accused Putin accused Putin "Bolshevik" (that is, communism), and said that Russia's mainstream opposition forces acted as ride in the Ukrainian war.</p>
<p>However, Dr Marina Miron, a defense researcher at King College of London, said why Russia's extremist nationalist organizations started war to Russia, which is puzzling.</p>
<p>"RDK should be established by Ukraine," she said. "It was a small loose organization in Russia before the war, and there was no armed branch at that time."</p>
<p>A RDK member code -named "Fortuna" told the Ukrainian media last November that the number of people in the organization was 120.</p>
<p>"We are a volunteer organization, not like the Ukrainian national service personnel who are convened through recruitment or contracts," he said.</p>
<h3>What is the Russian Free Legion?</h3>
<p>The Russian Liberal Legion (FRL) is also known as the Liberty of RussioGion. It is a very different organization to fight the Russian forces with the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>It uses the banner of "white-blue-white" and is considered by some people within Russia's opposition to be "Liberty Russia".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-06T08-51-26.000Z/_129839802_image.jpg" />Image source, leggliberty.army</p>
<p>It is politically considered to be as extreme as RDK.</p>
<p>On May 22, the legion announced that it had "liberated" the Russian village Keto Card, which was located next to the Ukraine border and located in the southwest of Buerg Rhoder.</p>
<p>"Legion and RDK continue to liberate the Belgore," the legion said.</p>
<p>The organization also stated: "The Russian citizens are safe and the Russian Federation's strong myths have been crushed again."</p>
<p>After that, it posted a video, showing that the balloon with the flag of the organization drifted over Moscow.</p>
<p>Former Russian member Ilyaponamarev is now a Ukrainian citizen. In August 2022, he said on Facebook that they and another organization called the National Republicanarmy ( Signed a declaration together, unanimously agreed to liberate Russia from Putin's rule as a common goal.</p>
<p>A soldier called Caesar and the most famous in the organization said: "No one in the legion was forced to join."</p>
<p>He said that a few members were Russian soldiers who surrendered to join the Ukrainian forces and they chose to go back.</p>
<h3>Do these Russian armed men get Ukraine support?</h3>
<p>Andriy Yusov's State Administration of Intelligence said that both organizations were "independently operated in Russia's territory" and Ukraine did not intervene.</p>
<p>Ukraine TV said they were militia and were "Russian volunteers."</p>
<p>However, Dr. Marina Mirang of the King's College of London questioned whether there was no support from the Ukrainian forces, and whether these organizations had the ability to cross the Russian border to launch an attack.</p>
<p>She also questioned why these organizations use Western equipment in the photos, such as Hummer military cars.</p>
<p>"They must rely on external support and information from the Ukrainian intelligence department," Dr. Mirang said.</p>
<p>"However, attacking through the Russian border is in line with the needs of Ukraine and can disperse the attention of the opponent's war in Ukraine, and say that these organizations are responsible for the attack, making it a reason for the past."</p>
<p>Ukrainian political analyst VolodymyRFESENKO said several different quasi -military organizations are working with Ukraine, but they seem to be more public relations and are not practical.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65837480/64828438"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-06T10-40-00Z/64828438_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany)) The National Bureau of Statistics of China recently announced that the national urban survey rate of urban survey in April this year was 5.1%, and the unemployment rate of <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率创记录-中国后新冠复苏难/a-65637338">16-24-year-old youth survey was 20.4%. </a>The WeChat "Eleven Finance Eleven" published an article by Wang Mingyuan, a researcher at the Beijing Reform and Development Research Association, which believes that the overall unemployment rate of 5.1%is obviously different from everyone's actual feelings. He analyzed several causes of unemployment statistics.</p>
<p>First of all, China set the standard of "employment" too low. According to the official webpage of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, it is considered an employment every week. Wang Mingyuan's article pointed out that in the same way, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/在德国工作几小时算失业/a-65852931">15 hours in the United States and 20 hours in France. </a>Secondly, the urban unemployment survey cannot count the statistics of migrant workers returning to the countryside due to unemployment.</p>
<p>Third, the social security participation rate of China's flexible employment population is very low, so it is difficult to understand its employment situation through indicators such as unemployment insurance and unemployment registration.</p>
<h3>20.4%is also difficult to be representative</h3>
<p>However, Wang Mingyuan's article believes that the unemployment rate at the age of 16-24 is 20.4%. For the entire youth group, this result is not representative. Because at this age, especially 16-20 years old, even if they are not promoted, the labor participation rate is not high, and it is maintained at more than 18%for a long time. Therefore, he selected the age group of 16-40 to define the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>According to his calculation, the Chinese epidemic has three years, and about 15 million graduates have not found a job. At the same time, about 10%of companies have unemployment in employees, of which 16-40 years old are about 25 million. In addition, he quoted Professor Lu Feng of Peking University, at least 23 million agricultural workers returned to his hometown at least 23 million in the past three years, of which about 14 million youths were estimated. In other words, the newly unemployed population has been added about 54 million since the epidemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, some of these unemployed people do not rule out some flexible employment. For example, the number of Didi active drivers in the past three years has increased by more than 1,200 million, and takeaway riders, courier, and distributors have increased by about 8 million. However, it is estimated that half, that is, 25 million-30 million is still unemployed. Therefore, conservatively estimated that the absolutely unemployed population increased by 25 million to 30 million before the epidemic, accounting for about 6.2-7.5%of the total number of labor market labor (402 million) in the age group.</p>
<h3>Under the epidemic, Chinese economy is asthmatic</h3>
<h3>Rural are not a way of solution</h3>
<p>Wang Mingyuan pointed out that expansion and slowing economic growth will lead to more severe employment problems in the next few years. The solution, he believes that it is not state -owned enterprise or <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德语媒体新时代的上山下乡运动/a-65661636">diverted to the countryside</a>-Because <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/青年失业率居高不下-靠孔乙己脱长衫解决/a-65732307">the scale of the rural economy is very limited, he is calculated equivalent to 10 Huawei, or 3 PetroChina, 7 semi-semi-Jingdong, so at most can only be placed in one or two million highly educated young people employment</a>Essence</p>
<p>He believes that from the past 10 years, China's employment increment is basically created by the development of the private economy. Therefore, the private economy, especially the digital economy and service industry need to be supported, and youth entrepreneurship should be encouraged.</p>

Most of the water comes from this reservoir. In addition, the cooling water of the Zapolo Nuclear Power Station, which was also occupied by the Russian army, also came from the reservoir. The water storage capacity of the reservoir is 18 cubic kilometers, which is equivalent to the water storage capacity of Da Salt Lake in Utah, the United States.</p>

<h3>Death and injury serious</h3>
<p>The UN Human Rights Affairs Office (OhChr) said on July 25 that since the start of the war on February 24, 5,237 civilians were killed and 7035 were injured, although the actual number of casualties should be much higher. Human Rights Higher High School said that most of the dead injuries are victims of explosive weapons, such as artillery, missiles and air strikes. In addition, the CIA estimates that so far, about 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, and the number of injuries is three times the number. The department believes that Ukraine's military loss is also very large, but it may be a little smaller than Russia's losses.</p>

<h3>High weapon assistance</h3>
<p>Since February 24, the United States has provided about $ 7.6 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, including the long -range rocket system, the anti -tank system, and protective equipment. The second largest aid country is Britain, which has provided £ 2.3 billion in military support. The European Union has agreed to provide 2.5 billion euros of security assistance to Ukraine.</p>

<h3>loss of Ukraine</h3>
<p>According to the calculation of Reuters, in addition to the loss of personnel, since Crimean was annexed by Russia in 2014, Ukraine has lost its control of 22%of its original land. The large coastline is occupied by Russia, the economy is paralyzed, and some cities have become ruins under war.

<h3>loss of Russia</h3>
<p>This war is also expensive to Russia -although Russia has not disclosed fees because it is national secret. In addition to military costs, the West also tried to punish Russia by imposing severe sanctions, including excluding it to SWIFT, the international payment system, which became the greatest impact on the Russian economy since the Soviet Union's disintegration in 1991. The Russian central bank predicts that the US $ 1.8 trillion economy will decline by 4%-6%in 2022, lower than the 8%-10%predicted in April.</p>

<h3>Shortage of resources</h3>
<p>The sanctions between Ukraine and the West have led to a sharp rise in chemical fertilizer, wheat, metal and energy prices, which has promoted the brewing food crisis and the wave of inflation that is impacting the global economy. Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and it is also the world's largest natural gas, wheat, nitrogen fertilizer and 钯 钯 exporter. European countries tried to reduce their dependence on Russia's oil and natural gas. After the Russia cut off the natural gas pipeline of Beixi 1 in Germany, Europe's natural gas wholesale prices soared. According to Goldman Sachs, if the natural gas pipeline is completely cut off, the euro zone will be recession, and both Germany and Italy will shrink significantly.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund now predicts that the world economy will increase by 3.2%this year, lower than 6.1%last year.

<p>(Voice of Germany) NancyFaeser, German Federal Internal Affairs Minister, said in an interview with the Business Daily: "In my opinion, three security points involved in China involved in China rely."</p>

<p>"Business Daily" quoted <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德国三大情报机构警告不要对专制中国太天真/a-63472850">German security industry</a>According to sources, investigators found that Chinese practices often participate in projects in German companies through scientific cooperation. Once a guest scholars obtain a channel to enter the enterprise IT system, they will try to get more information about these projects. For example, in 2020, a Chinese scientist used a spy operation against a medical technology company in northern Germany under the official instruction of Chinese officials. This case is still confidential. Safety people said that this is a typical case of a Chinese guest scholar caused the outflow of professional and technical knowledge in Germany.</p>

From mid -2015 to May 2016, a doctoral student from China participated in the university research project team to get the opportunity to participate in this project. His interest in new technologies is obviously too high.</p>
<p>The company's new coating technology patent has been registered in China. This also confirmed the company's suspicion of the spy behavior of Chinese scholars' research results.</p>
<p>The article also pointed out that after returning to China, the scholar became a professor at Northwestern University of Technology.

These schools are at the forefront of military research in the People's Republic of China and have a close relationship with the military.</p>
<p>Ferizer called for strengthening security measures. In order to continue to prevent spy behavior of patents, technical tricks, and innovative knowledge, it is especially important to "ensure that enterprises and research institutions have established a clear risk awareness and strict protection measures."</p>

After this song has recently been mistaken for the "Hong Kong National Anthem" by international sports events, the Hong Kong Government officially applied to the court to prohibit anyone from spreading this song. What impact will the Hong Kong government's move bring?</p>
<p><strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/4-03222023115724.html">Google refuses to remove the "Hong Kong National Anthem" search result in Hong Kong to stop advertising in Google</a></em>* </strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-01202023125612.html">New Hong Kong rule of law: "Rongguang" songs and humiliation of the national anthem sale records involved in incitement</a></em><em> </em><strong> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/gf2-12052022142306.html">The Hong Kong Police of the Hong Kong Police in the International Stadium Rest again to start the investigation</a></strong> <strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/ec-12152022102212.html">Google said to Beijing and the Hong Kong Government that China has failed to be invalid? </a></strong></p>
<p>"Why this land, tears reappear; why make everyone, but also resentful ..." "Glory to Hongkong" (Glory to Hongkong ", this first fighting song in 2019, once sounded. The streets and lanes in Hong Kong may be the first "ban song" since the opening of Hong Kong in the future.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Department of Justice applied to the High Court forbidden to make a ban, prohibiting anyone from spreading, playing, printing, publishing, selling, distributing, spreading or displaying the song "Wish Relief to Hong Kong" on the Internet or any platform. , Inciting others to split the country; or have "incite intention" and advocate the separation of Hong Kong from China. The scope of the prohibition includes song melody, lyrics, and even adapted versions.</p>
<p><strong> Article 32 of the Hong Kong Government List "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" films with hand language and various language versions </strong></p>
<p>The enrollment of the Hong Kong Department of Justice also said that "Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" may be mistaken for "Hong Kong National Anthem", or that Hong Kong is an "independent country" with the national anthem, which is intended to insult the national anthem and violate the "National Anthem Regulations" in Hong Kong. A total of 32 "Wish Glory Back to Hong Kong" related YouTube videos, including pure music version, orchestra version, sign language version, and different languages such as English and German, requiring relevant persons to stop spread immediately.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Government later issued a statement explaining, pointing out that the lyrics of "Wanting to Return to Hong Kong" contain slogans that have been incited by the court, and have been mistakenly expressed as "Hong Kong National Anthem" recently, which has insulted the national anthem and caused the country and the Special Economic Zone. Serious damage, emphasizing that in order to maintain national security, the application is necessary, reasonable and legal, and meet the requirements of the relevant human rights bill.</p>
<p><strong> Try to ban the song by the court program </strong></p>
<p>Former Hong Kong District Councilor Liu Jiawen, the former Hong Kong district, told this station that since the implementation of the National Security Law of the Hong Kong District, the Hong Kong Government has continuously suppressed the culture and art world with tangible or intangible hands; Disposal, many movies cannot be released in Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong government officially applied for a specific song for a specific song, but for the first time. She believes that it will make a very bad precedent.</p>
<p>Liu Jiawen said: "With my memory, this should be the first time that the government uses court procedures to apply for a ban on this song to be released or played in Hong Kong. Of course With the first precedent, many different publishing freedom and cultural freedom will be suppressed after that. "</p>
<p>At present, the relevant prohibited order application is waiting for the court's instructions, and the hearing date is to be determined. Huang Weiguo, assistant professor of the former assistant professor of the Department of Political and International Relations of the Hong Kong Baptist University in the UK, told the station that the ruling of the Hong Kong court will release important information to the international community.</p>
<p>Huang Weiguo said: "If the court really presented the play" Wish Rongguang to Hong Kong ", it can be said that since the opening of Hong Kong's port, the government has expressed its first explicit regulations. There is no existence, and it collapses further. "</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Government has not pointed out what incite slogans containing the lyrics of "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong", but there is a sentence in the song "Dawn comes, to recover, this Hong Kong; peers, children, the revolution of the times." The defendant Tang Yingjie, the first defendant who was sentenced to 9 years in Hong Kong by the National Security Law, was judged that the power of his motorcycles was hanging the banner of "restoring Hong Kong, the Revolution of the Times", and pointed out that the slogan could "incite others to split the country" Essence</p>
<p><strong> How much is the actual role in blocking the "Broadcasting National Anthem" in international competitions? </strong></p>
<p>Since last year, when the Hong Kong team played the international sports competition, it repeatedly made a storm of "Broadcasting the wrong National Anthem" -the organizer mistakenly regarded "Wish Rongguang to Hong Kong" as "Hong Kong National Anthem", not the Chinese national anthem "The Volunteer March". The Hong Kong Government asked Google to "top" the Volunteer Army when searching for "Hong Kong National Anthem", but was rejected by Google.</p>
<p>Huang Weiguo believes that the situation of the "National Anthem" of the international sports events embarrassed the Hong Kong government, so he intended to prevent the ban from spreading "willing to glory to Hong Kong", so that it ranked after the internet search results in the middle of the hall to avoid the error in the international competition organizers. However, he believes that the approach of the Hong Kong government is "covering the ears and stealing the bell", because the Hong Kong government cannot control the results of the online search results of foreign users, and Hong Kong people in Hong Kong can still search for information such as VPN and other ways to "underground" circulating collective memories of Hong Kong people. Essence</p>
<p>Former Hong Kong District Councilor Guo Zijian, a former Hong Kong District Councilor, stated that "Wish Rongguang Back to Hong Kong" appeared during the 2019 Rebellion and spread all over the world. Although it is not the official national anthem of Hong Kong Represents Hong Kong people.<strong> Overseas law enforcement is difficult </strong></p>
<p>Tang Jiazhen, a member of the executive committee of a senior barrister, said that if the court issued a ban, the offender can be charged with "contempt of the court" and sentenced to 7 years in prison. He believes that the safest way of citizens is to delete related songs that have been downloaded or still retained. However, he acknowledged that there was some difficulties in overseas law enforcement.</p>
<p>Liu Jiawen said that "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" is not only the "iconic" song of the 2019 resistance movement. At present, in the activities of overseas Hong Kong people, it also plays an important role. The entry point of the interaction.</p>
<p>She believes that even if the Hong Kong court issued a ban order, overseas Hong Kong people's organizers will not have concerns about playing "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong". They believe that Britain is a free and democratic country, and Hong Kong people can express their opinions freely. The participants of the event will also evaluate the risks by themselves and protect themselves in different ways. I believe that the ban will not have much impact on overseas Hong Kong people.</p>

A vibrato user read this article in the recording video to share with others. Asian facts check the laboratory compares the sound of this vibrato user to read the article and the so -called "Qin Gang recording" on the Internet. The results show that the sound is likely to be the same person, that is, the so -called "internal speech recording" It is likely that Qin Gang was named by Chinese netizens.</p>
<p><strong> Deep analysis: </strong></p>
<p>Twitter, YouTube (YouTube) recently circulated a period of internal speech recording of Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang (hereinafter referred to as "Qin Gang Recording"). 06012023: Qin Gang's internal speech recording: War is inevitable, only the relationship between life and death in China and the United States "](https://www.qtown.media/share/linkPage/881D5921-269C-4680-BABF-20B53C065E41.html)However, the publisher did not provide other information such as the so -called "Qin Gang speech" and other information.</p>
<p>In more than a minute of video, there is only a photo of high -level officials in China and the United States. The voice is a conversation of a man about Sino -US relations. The only way is to be war. " The so -called "Qin Gang's internal speech" recording has attracted attention, including Chinese writers <a href="https://twitter.com/cskun1989/status/1664646472598708229?s=12&amp;t=iMT9e3zK4fPrPnDnWWxPUQ">Cai Shenkun</a>Former Chinese diplomat <a href="https://twitter.com/chen_yonglin/status/1664949792089288706">Chen Yonglin</a>Waiting for people to forward and discuss this matter, and some people help videos with English subtitles, but many people question the credibility of the source of the media.</p>

<p>Asian facts investigation of the laboratory inquiry in the section of "Qin Gang's speech" was found behind, and its content was highly similar to an article on the Internet. It was published by "Tan Jide", who claimed to be a media person <a href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/H684R8850550WCN1.html">"Farewell to the United States!Human civilization is positive. Facing a bloody critical point "</a>Essence The following comparison recording and part of the article (yellow characters are different places):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-27-00-04-00/000005.png" />Comparison of the recording content of the "Qin Gang Speech" and the content of the online article (Asian facts check the laboratory drawing) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06062023150630.html/p3-8c088bdd51855bb95bf96bd4-7b804f53.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-27-00-04-00/000006.png" /></a><strong> Is the sound in the audio Qin Gang? </strong></p>
<p><strong> At 4 minutes and 40 seconds, the background appeared strangely. </strong></p>
<p>Asian facts check the laboratory found that several Douyin users shared the article "Farewell to the United States!Human civilization is facing a bloody critical point" by recording videos. "Farewell to the United States (1)"](https://www.douyin.com/video/7149160800836537611), The same strange sound appeared at 8 minutes and 42 seconds. Showing "wind and rain" and "Qin Gang Recording" are likely to be the same source. The possibility of the so -called Qin Gang recording from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Another user "Marriy" released last April ["Deep Think!!!Farewell to the United States, globalization is dead, storm is really here (3/6)"]](https://www.douyin.com/video/7091008599908044071)Video, in the picture, the accent, pause, and words of men's speaking are similar to Qin Gang's audio. After investigation, the source of the picture is <a href="https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAAqYmID85J8Ju6MHik-c2fmnUfUrWNXxGj5S8aBtitCM4">"Sixth Brother Chatting Life"</a>Douyin, but the original video was not found in the user's work.The "Qin Gang recording" circulating on the Internet has been from the beginning to 4 minutes and 32 seconds. The content is the theme of the "Four, the essence of the Sino -US dispute" of the above article. From 4 minutes and 33 seconds, it receives other parts of the article. After comparison, it was found that in addition to a small number of words and articles, most of the contents were consistent.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-27-00-04-00/000007.png" />The Qin Gang recording and vibrato user recording circulating on the Internet compared with the AI open platform. As a result, the probability of the same person's voice was 93.81%. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06062023150630.html/p4-5728ai958b653e5e7353f06bd45c0d7db28def4e0a6d4150b3768479e6525b930497f3-4ee553ca629697f375286236930497f3-7d50679c70ba540c4e004eba7684807297f369827387662f93-81-3002.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-27-00-04-00/000008.png" /></a>  <img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-27-00-04-00/000009.png" />Qin Gang's recording on the Internet compared with the AI open platform and Qin Gang's press conference on March 7th, the result was 65.78%of the sound probability of the same person. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/shishi-hecha/hc-06062023150630.html/p5-5728ai958b653e5e7353f06bd45c0d7db28def4e0a6d4150b3768479e6525b930497f3-4ee553ca79e6525b36708765e58a1880056703767c8a00-7d50679c70ba540c4e004eba7684807297f369827387662f65-78-3002-1.png"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-06T15-27-00-04-00/000010.png" /></a>We entrusted another information engineer with acoustic pattern identification experience in Taiwan to perform identification. He compared the audio of "Qin Gang Recording" and "Sixth Brother Life" circulating on the Internet, and found that the ups and downs of the two audio were consistent; Yes, the two are likely to be the same audio.</p>
<p>Asian facts investigation laboratory asked the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy in the United States on June 5th. The recording of the Internet was Qin Gang's voice, but the interruption of the draft has not yet been replied.</p>
<p><strong>in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Although Chinese officials have not responded, the Asian facts check the laboratory failed to further confirm the authenticity of the audio, but Qin Gang reads an article released by the Internet author last year internally, and his tone, accent, and words are "coincident" and shaking The same possibility of sound users is quite low.</p>
<p>After comparison of online articles, Douyin videos, and sound pattern recognition, the Asian factual investigation laboratory believes that the so -called Qin Gang internal speech recording circulating on the Internet is likely not to say what Qin Gang said, but after someone edited the existing videos of the Internet on the Internet , Crown Qin Gang's name, spread error information.</p>

<p>Recently, China ’s increasingly provocative military operations have caused the situation in the Taiwan Strait and the regional area of the South China Sea. At the end of last month, the Chinese military aircraft intercepted the US reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea in the South China Sea to "unprofessional". Just last week, when the U.S. warships and Canadian warships jointly sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a PLA warship again faced the United States again against the United States. The risk interception of the warship caused the two ships to almost collide.</p>
<p>Aiming at China's increasingly aggressive actions in the Indo -Pacific region, the HudsonInstitute of Washington think tank in the United States held a seminar on Tuesday. Participating scholars jointly discussed China's threat to the existing international order, and the Indo -Pacific Affairs Coordinator of the White House National Security Council, Kurd Campbell, also attended the meeting.</p>
<p><strong> Campbell: The Meizhong needs a direct dialogue mechanism to avoid accidents </strong></p>
<p>Campbell said that the dialogue mechanism of the two countries in the United States and China is being established, and the incident that the two military warships are almost in the Taiwan Strait shows that the importance of the two sides has the importance of direct dialogue pipelines: "The dialogue mechanism in the United States and China has gradually opened up, and we start to convey to convey Their respective interests and concerns. US Secretary of Defense Lloydaustin mentioned at the Shangri -La Safety Dialogue Conference that establishing a direct dialogue mechanism between the United States and China is quite important. China's national strength is strengthening, and the military friction in the United States and China shows unprecedented tension. Both sides are both sides. The possibility of military misjudgment is gradually increasing. "</p>
<p>Campbell said: "During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union had established effective communication pipelines. When the expected crisis occurred, the two sides could coordinate. But we could not do so with China, and China was unwilling to interact with the United States ... ... Chinese warships have recently carried out dangerous navigation steering in an attempt to block the US military's escort operation in the Taiwan Strait, which highlights the importance of the existence of the direct dialogue mechanism. "</p>
<p>At the meeting, Campbell also talked about the stance of the Biden government on the issue of Taiwan, and reiterated that the United States was committed to maintaining the status quo of the Taiwan Strait: "We realize Taiwan's major achievements in democracy and science and technology. We support these achievements and hope to maintain it ... ... … We must be careful of misjudgment or military accidents in the Taiwan Strait, which may lead to the consequences of expected. The current goal of the United States is to ensure that it is strong and clear to China, and at the same time, it is also avoiding the conflict that causes the conflict. "</p>

<p>The outside world noticed that the Chinese military's provocative attitude towards the United States coincided with the 34th anniversary of the June 4th incident. Ye Yaoyuan, director of the Department of International Studies and Contemporary Linguistics of St. Tomas University in the United States, told reporters in an interview with this station that the Beijing authorities may intend to disperse the people's attention to the June 4th incident with military events: "It (Chinese government) may want to borrow borrowing It is a possibility to guide domestic public opinion by a more provocative demonstration. Another possibility is that China has recently been very dissatisfied with the trend of the internationalization of the United States. It may be more dangerous and provocative. Actions come to express the disgust with the United States. "</p>
<p>In response to the concerns about China ’s contradictions about domestic social contradictions, Ye Yaoyuan believes that the war will make Beijing a huge cost, and at the same time, the Chinese army’ s war experience is not enough. Therefore, the possibility of launching the war on Taiwan in the short term is The Communist Party of China faces the disadvantages that cannot be reversed in China, or the challenge to the regime is very obvious, otherwise it will generally not do this (attack Taiwan). "</p>
<p><strong> Campbell: The goal of the United States is not to restrict China's rise </strong></p>
<p>Campbell also emphasized at the seminar that the international order established by the United States has prompted the Indo -Pacific region to experience unprecedented prosperity in the past 50 years, and the local people have left poverty. Although China often accuses the United States of intentionally obstructing China to become regional hegemony, in fact, the goal of the United States is to defend the existing international order to ensure that the Indo -Pacific region can enjoy continuous peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Campbell said: "As a rising country, it will not unexpectedly want to change the existing order, such as economic coercion or unilateral territorial declaration. These changes make the United States and Indo -Pacific countries worry. Prosperity has caused great harm. Therefore, what the United States wants to do is to maintain a good international system now.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-06T23-23-13-00-00/000154924_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>Alibaba's financial report on May 18th was the first small test "transcript" after the drastic spin -off reform. In addition to the details of the financial report, the central idea is the efforts to reduce losses and continue to improve. Although Alibaba conveyed determination to investors, when describing the past performance and prospects of the past, it still kept cautiously.</p>
<p>Alibaba has been divided into six major business groups, which aims to enhance the company's shareholder value and market competition sequencing. These new business units are: Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Commercial Group, Local Service Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics, Global Digital Business Group and Digital Media Entertainment Group. Each group is managed by its own CEO and the board of directors. Although the groups are operating around their core business, they still cover many business departments and projects that have not been listed alone. Many analysts point out that the intention of this reorganization is that on the one hand, the government has eased the government's concerns about "big but not falling" through "slimming". situation.</p>
<p>Alibaba must find a balance between diversified development and operational complexity. As an enterprise group with Chinese characteristics, Alibaba is promoting three core reform tasks in parallel.</p>
<p>The first is to do a good job of valuation management. At the phone conference call, Ali revealed the future direction and announced the establishment of a capital management committee under the board of directors of Alibaba Group. This committee, which is composed of key members such as Vice Chairman Cai Chongxin, former CFO Wuwei, CEO Zhang Yong, and President Michael Evans, etc., allocate the main capital allocation of various business departments.</p>
<p>Under the new holding structure, the newly established compliance and risk committee members are high. This committee supervises a extensive list of "reservations". Although the list is separated from the Capital Management Committee, other compliance issues need to be approved by the committee except for financial reports.</p>
<p>In other words, fiscal and regulatory power has returned to the hands of a small number of people who can make decisions. However, the transparent decision and governance mechanism is transparent, which helps enhance the confidence of investors, thereby achieving the purpose of supporting valuation.</p>
<p>At the same time, Alibaba must continue to repurchase stocks and attract strategic investors to support its valuation. On the one hand, all kinds of operations are under pressure, but it can also be interpreted as "make full use" of the remaining value and transform through financial means. Whether a company, including Cainiao Logistics and Hema Xiansheng, can successfully go public, will be properly handled after Alibaba's reorganization, and effectively manage its important tests and interests with each holding company. If these IPOs cannot be proceeded smoothly, the investor will question Alibaba's business strategy adjustment. Therefore, the execution results of these IPOs will become the key indicator of Alibaba's future development direction.</p>
<p>Alibaba's reorganization will undoubtedly change its relationship with investors, and at the same time, it will also have a profound impact on its internal working methods and power games. However, whether these changes can succeed depends on whether Alibaba can continue to develop in meeting the expectations of investors while maintaining the status of China's largest e -commerce platform. From a more macro perspective, Alibaba's reorganization and changes may reflect a greater industry trend. In China and the world, technology companies are facing growing competitive pressures, and new challenges caused by regulatory pressure and increasing public expectations. Enterprises need to reform and maintain competitiveness.</p>
<p>The second item is the relationship with competitors and regulatory mechanisms. The global competition pattern of the technology industry is changing. Emerging challengers, such as Pinduoduo and byte beating, with their more wolf execution, they have taken the market share of leading technology giants such as Alibaba in domestic and foreign markets. Alibaba's business reorganization can be regarded as a strategy to deal with this new competitive pattern. After spin -off, it becomes more flexible and more easily attractive to new strategic investment, thereby enhancing the transparency of investors. There is no doubt that Alibaba is now at a key turning point. It must adapt to the increasingly complex and fierce competitive environment in order to maintain a leading position in the new stage of development.</p>
<p>One means is to optimize the size of personnel. In the past year, Alibaba has reduced 7.7%of employees or about 19,725 full -time employees. In addition to cutting costs, potential spin -off, subsidiary fundraising and planned IPOs further marked the strategic transformation from expansion to monetization. Facing the government's big background for strengthening supervision of the science and technology industry, it involves more stringent requirements for fair competition, data security, and user rights. Alibaba will also face new pressure and responsibilities to adjust and re -examine its business model and strategy.</p>
<p>The third item is the business that is not excellent in divestitution, and has a financing potential but consumes a lot of cash business. The use of financial means to focus on the prospects of improving capital efficiency and profit, but a series of measures to increase revenue reduction and minus and subtracts by Ali are also double -edged swords.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud Intelligent Group is preparing to go on a listing plan for the next 12 months to 18 months, which involves a series of complex issues. First of all, Alibaba Cloud decided to listed independently involving asset reorganization and the responsibility of facing future hardware depreciation and capital expenditure. This may affect the profitability of new listed companies, and Ali Group has affected the proportion of equity in this China ’s largest cloud platform after its successful listing.</p>
<p>In addition, valuation is also a tricky issue. According to Interconnected's survey, Alibaba Cloud's revenue in the past quarter has contracted -2%year-on-year shrinkage. The reason is that the byte beating of Alibaba Cloud's income has shifted its overseas business to Oracle to meet the technical requirements for protecting American user data. Goldman Sachs has recently valued Alibaba Cloud $ 41 billion(Its EV/sales of TTM 3.7 times)Essence Compared with Alibaba, which is about $ 215 billion in market value, if Alibaba Yun wants to achieve a market value of the same size after splitting, it is obvious that there is still a long way to take a long way.</p>
<p>"The future is a stronger, more agile, and embracing the future." This sentence is full of expectations and the flavor of warning for Ali, who is experiencing reform and baptism.</p>

<p>50年前美国国内曾经历了一场激烈的公众辩论，当时引起美国民众广泛关注的问题是：如果苏联对美国的核武器基地发动核打击的话，会给普通老百姓造成多大伤亡。这场公众讨论的焦点是美国政府于上世纪60年代在人口稀少的中西部地区建造的数百个洲际弹道导弹发射井。万一美苏爆发核战争，这些导弹发射井将成为首要的被打击目标。经由美国的独立学者、国会的研究机构以及最终由美国国防部进行的研究发现，这些位于人口稀少区的导弹发射井受袭后产生的放射性尘埃将随风扩散至数百英里外，从而带来数百万的平民死亡。这些研究成果深刻地影响了公众对美国核政策的广泛关注和审视监督。</p>
<p>如今，据信中国正在其西北偏远地区建造总计数百个发射井的三个大型洲际弹道导弹发射井基地。虽然中国这种增强核力量的措施在理论上可以降低美国对中国发动核打击的可能性，但中国决策者显然对这种核打击依然有所担心。既然中国不认为中美之间爆发核战争的可能性小到可以完全忽略，那么处于西北地区的这些导弹基地很可能在核战争初期成为首当其冲被打击的目标。近日，一项新的研究首次揭示了中国核导弹发射井的部署与美国现有核战略之间的相互作用可能导致的平民伤亡规模。</p>
<p>据公开信息显示，中国正在进行的扩大核武库的进程是全方位的，包括陆基、海基和空基核武器。美国国防部估计，到2027年，中国的核武库规模可能达到700枚核弹头，到2030年可能达到1000枚，达到与美俄同样的数量级。其中重要的一环就是位于西北地区的三个洲际弹道导弹发射基地。这些基地一旦建成，可能容纳超过300枚新的洲际弹道导弹，如果每枚导弹携带三个弹头，仅这三个基地就能将中国的核武器总数增加近1000枚，成为中国未来核武库的中坚力量。在中国长期保有大概200枚核武器的数十年之后，这标志着前所未有的核力量扩充。</p>
<p>中美之间不断升级的政治和安全竞争已使中美核冲突成为一个更加严重和紧迫的军事话题。中国近年来似乎也在逐渐放弃之前简单的大规模核反击战略，转向更复杂的分级或灵活核反击，获得更精确可控地对不同规模和级别的核打击进行同等反击的能力，以对不同程度的核威胁进行更有效威慑。在中美双方均依赖灵活反应的分级核打击能力试图对核战争升级进程进行有利于己方的管控时，核冲突发生的门槛将比之前降低，核战争开打之后不断升级的风险也比之前升高。</p>
<p>虽然美国的核战略并不试图对中国这样的对手发动突然性的全面核打击，但是在双方越过核门槛后的战争逐渐升级过程中，美国为了限制自己的核心军事系统和人口可能遭受的损害，并不排除会对对手尚存的核武器发动攻击。在这种背景下，中国在内蒙古、甘肃、新疆的三个洲际导弹发射井基地就有可能成为重点目标。此次发表在同行评议的期刊《科学与全球安全》上的新研究利用了美国核战略的公开信息、中国新建导弹井的位置以及详细的气象和人口分布数据，以了解此类攻击的影响。</p>
<p>鉴于导弹井基地处于荒漠地带，核爆炸产生的冲击波、热浪和瞬时核辐射会杀伤附近居民，但范围更广的危害将来自于放射性物质随风向下风向扩散，在随后的数天至几周内对远至几千公里之外的广大人口稠密地区带来超过致死量的放射性沉降。计算机模拟显示，在平均气象条件下，如果人们有机会使用庇护设施以减少辐射暴露，那么中国东部人口稠密地区可能有超过500万人因放射性沉降而死亡。在最糟糕的气象条件下，可能会有超过1300万人死亡。如果人们没有机会获得提前预警并在随后的数天内采取防范躲避措施，那么平均死亡人数可能达到1700万人，最坏气象条件下可能达到4600万人。</p>
<p>尤其令人担忧的是位于内蒙古鄂尔多斯的导弹井基地。由于这些导弹井的位置，当地的气象条件可能导致核爆炸产生的放射性物质升入高空并直接飘向北京，导致首都及周边地区的严重平民伤亡。</p>
<p>上述研究仅考虑了三个偏远地区导弹井基地受袭的有限情景，并没有包括其它位于人口稠密区的核武基地受袭的影响。即使在这种有限场景下，单单中国的平民死亡人数就可能超过全球范围内第一次世界大战的总平民死亡人数，接近第二次世界大战的总平民死亡人数。这些数字表明，虽然美国的核政策禁止对平民目标进行直接打击，但其针对偏远地区纯粹军事设施的打击仍然会造成不可想象的平民伤亡。核武器使用政策能否符合国际人道主义法律原则，是包括美国在内的核武器国家需要深刻反省的问题。</p>
<p>对于中国来说，中国公众很少就若中国与美国围绕台湾或其他问题爆发战争时对他们自己和子孙后代的生命安全、健康和正常生活会有何种潜在后果进行公开讨论。这在一定程度上推动了国内舆论场中常见的挺战言论。中国网民也常常支持强硬的核政策。他们似乎很少去深入探讨，即使中国有能力用核武器对美国造成不堪承受的人员损失，但在战争升级到核冲突的早期阶段，中国可能需要付出的生命代价。</p>
<p>即便是中国安全和核政策领域的专业研究人员也很少广泛关注或进行关于不同冲突情景的自身损伤后果的公开定量研究。对导弹井的风险以及导弹井遭到攻击的可能后果的公开研究缺失，反映出学者和政策专家还不认为此类发生几率小但后果极为严重的问题应该在公共对话空间予以关注和探讨。鄂尔多斯基地的选址暴露的风险表明，在决策过程中可能没有充分考虑相关问题，或者决策过程中的相关研究可能不够深入。</p>
<p>西北导弹井受袭产生的核尘埃不会停留在中国边境，还可能导致邻国如朝鲜、韩国、日本和蒙古等地100的平民死亡。正如中国所倡导的“人类命运共同体”的理念所体现的那样，大国的安全政策及大国间的安全对抗可能对地区甚至全球民众的生命和健康产生直接影响。</p>
<p>Even if the Chinese public does not care about the economic costs and environmental impacts of such large -scale projects in peacetime, they may still want to know how their lives and long -term health will be affected by the occurrence of military conflicts, as well as the large -scale China’s large scale. Whether the construction of nuclear forces will bring other risks at the level of national interests and international relations. It is clear that these issues require sufficient time and effective supervision of the guarantee of the checks and balance mechanism. Hurrying may bring risks that are greater than the result of income. Various experiences and lessons in the development of modern society show that in a closed decision -making system without public knowledge and participation, it is difficult to ensure the objectivity, scientificity and balance of relevant decision -making, and fully consider that all domestic interests Concern. The detours that the United States has gone in this regard is worth learning from everyone.</p>
<p>The incomparable international responsibility of Nuclear Nuclear States such as China and the United States needs to ensure that its nuclear weapons policy is open, transparent, and highly responsible. They also need to actively explore various reducing risk measures such as military control and crisis management. Responsible policy formulation comes from actively accepting the supervision of domestic public and seriously responding to the concerns of the international public. In the context of the current upgrading of nuclear competitions and tensions between major powers, the ability of public knowledge and rational expression is particularly important. Only by increasing internal transparency and allowing the public to discuss and formulate strategic policies can the country's nuclear policies and strategic security decisions not only maintain national security, but also balance domestic and international interests, and promote global peace and stability.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/FT Chinese Free Version/2023-06-06T23-43-40-00-00/000183528_piclink.jpg" />Warm reminder from FT Chinese website: If you are interested in the content of more FT Chinese website, please search for "FT Chinese Network" in Apple App Store or Google Application Market and download the official applications of FT Chinese website.</p>
<p>In January of this year, I left the company that worked for five years and gave up a decent work in a social sense. This also meant that I gave up a role and sense of belonging with social recognition. Many friends care about or surprised or puzzled: "Why are you going to leave?"</p>
<p>In our habitual thinking, people are "fixed" on the label of a job. If a person is not working, it is difficult for his foreign social business card to have a identity that everyone is understood and accepted. You have no job, who are you? This sentence is very familiar. Similar sentence patterns are full of us and there are: Why don't you get married?</p>
<p>But when we have been in a high -pressure and alienated environment for a long time, our spirit is in tightness and excitement for a long time, and people are either easily burnout or form a defense mechanism. Fortunately, I did not let myself live a vague middle -aged man. A sound of the heart rises, "This should not be what I want." The day of naked resignation was almost 4 months old. Interestingly, after the resignation, I did not know why it gradually became a resignation opinion in the sisters circle. Leaders, friends who want to resign will come to seek my opinion when they are entangled, although I will not encourage everyone to leave at will.</p>
<p>Little J is a friend I work in Hong Kong, because what I do is cross -border e -commerce facing the mainland market. I need to work with partners working in the Mainland every day. When she came down, she felt exhausted. She wanted to resign and rest, but the family did not support her naked, so she couldn't make up her mind. Little Z is a friend who works in a central enterprise. The central enterprise has stable benefits, and she has been an outstanding employee in the company in the company in recent years. Go. It turns out that many people are not so satisfied with their current situation.</p>
<p>There is a resonance sticker on Douban: I feel that the life of the Chinese seems to be unable to stop. I have to keep going forward for a moment. If I say I want to take a break, people around you will feel that I am crazy Lost. The highest reply from the bottom is more concrete: Our Gapyear is Gao Si, the second year of the World War II, the second year of the test and the test of the test. It is not to be single in the end. What we oppose is a kind of rigidity, a kind of freedom to lose its own choice.</p>
<p>"People need to rest or can also rest." This almost common sense concept has not become a consensus among our diligent and brave nation, especially with the rapid economic development of more than 40 years. The value of the value of our current is unconscious that we don't need to move the brain. Therefore, this inherited subconscious has become a kind of tacit understanding between peers -busy is our halo and armor.</p>
<p>Looking back at the days before resigning, you can summarize it as "both burnout and hard work". Extremely dissatisfied with your own life. When the bottom state of a person is not very good, any building covered on it is crumbling. Before I resigned, I was such a crumbling feeling, although everything outside looked together.</p>
<p>In the days when I stopped, I started to touch my truly "important but not urgent" list. "Cleaning" once became the first theme. Whether it was a book piled up at home, some had not had time to turn it over, or overflowing the clothes of the wardrobe in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Passing through, items that have no value to use are determined to clean up my space regardless of the price code. This is a way to farewell to the old self.</p>
<p>However, I found that "cleaning" is not an easy task for me. It is a project that needs to be achieved repeatedly, because there will always be an excuse to tell myself that you do n’t wear clothes. After all, I still find time to read it ... In the last cabinet clothes, we did not have less visible to the naked eye. Maybe we are clearly clear what kind of life we want.</p>
<p>"When I am cultivating the soil, I also cultivate my heart. When I clear the weeds in the garden, I also know the anxiety, anger, pride, self, and fear of my inner weeds." Items, I want to make room for new experience flows. Behind this is not only the reconciliation of our past, but also means that we have prepared what kind of life we want to hug.</p>
<p>In the morning class in the morning in one day, my yoga teacher said that people only need to relax quietly in the practice of yoga. Just be on, don't worry about hard work. I am a little bit realized.</p>
<p>Target -oriented, abnormal force, I don't think this is the "disease" that needs to be cured. After resigning, from one state to another state, I slowly realized that we could look around more three -dimensional to life. A new continent. What follows is the state of life that has a natural flow. You don't have to struggle like fighting every day, which has also become a brand new experience.</p>
<p>What is even more surprising is that when I go home to accompany my parents, I find that I can really "see" them. The so -called "seeing" is clearly clear about the topic between them. Dad chats endlessly. In the past, I thought that things that were not "worth" at all, and naturally flowed through my sensory experience.</p>
<p>Let yourself be consciously staying with the surrounding space, living in the moment is no longer a truth from others. This kind of unreasonable feeling is like a bouquet of sunlight through the gaps on a cement wall scattered scattered scattered. Directly shot into my life. This may be the current popular mindfulness training.</p>
<p>When the time left to yourself increases, the width of people's minds increases, and the ability to feel the living world is also recovering. Creating a new experience becomes more natural. After re -communication with many friends who have not been in contact for a long time, I found that friends of the same age are actually facing similar dilemmas. They are 35 years old, psychological burnout and the confusion of drilling from time to time ... Following the direction of the water flow, so I started to start with the water flow, so I started to start. "Life after 35" series column. Every time I face an interview object, it is a new experience from talking about a new topic. Rather than saying that this is a column to write others, it is better to say that this is the way to enter others to see the three -dimensional life.</p>
<p>American scholar William Bryic said in his famous work "The Book of Transformation", "The beginning is the end, the end is the beginning, and it is the end of the end." If my friend really determined to resign, Then I will tell them the first time, "Congratulations!Don't waste every naked resignation easily."</p>

<p>Some scholars have described the cooperation between China and the United States with the term "Chimerica" (China and the United States), which is a state of embracing symbiosis. In the past ten years, relations between the two countries have moved towards unrestrained mutual exclusion. Now, the two parties in Washington have reached a consensus that the long -term strategy of deepening the economic relations with China has failed. The Chinese leadership has increasingly regarded the United States as a threat to survival. In these two countries, if anyone claims to take a more relaxed route, it will be regarded as politically naive or worse.</p>

Britain has stated that the news is "very worrying", and any intimidation of foreigners in China or other countries in British territory is unacceptable.</p>
<p>In a written statement submitted to the British Parliament, Dong Qinda said that the British police had investigated the three suspected police stations mentioned by the "Protection Guard". So far, the police have not seized any evidence of "the Chinese government conducts illegal activities in these places", but "we evaluate the supervision of the police and the public may suppress these locations or any administrative functions that have been ever had."</p>
<p>Dong Qinda said that the establishment of such sites without the permission of the British and their existence may allow people who avoid the United Kingdom from China to seek safety and freedom, and are worried.</p>
<p>He said that the Foreign Commonwealth and DevelopmentOffice has been informed that the Chinese Embassy has not accepted any activities related to such "police service stations", and such stations may not be in any form in the UK Operation. The Chinese Embassy subsequently responded that all such sites have been permanently closed. If any further allegations are available, China will conduct a rapid investigation based on British law.</p>
<p>China has always denied operating any such police stations, emphasizing that these sites only provide administrative services. Regarding Dong Qinda's statement, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London reiterated that the so -called "overseas police station" is a non -existence and downright political lies at all, and said that "this topic of individual politicians hyped is purely political manipulation." The spokesman emphasized that the Chinese side urged the British side to stop spreading false information, stop rendering speculation and slandering China.</p>

<p>Several U.S. officials who did not want to be named revealed that Brinken's exact time to restart China's trip is still uncertain because the discussion is still in the stage of private discussion. The news was the first to report by Bloomberg. Later, many international media such as Reuters, CNN, and Wall Street Journal followed up.</p>

<p>坎貝爾強調，與中國保持「適當的外交」至關重要，但中國官員已經回絕了美國在潛在衝突中試圖進行溝通的努力。上週，中國國防部長李尚福拒絕與美國國防部長奧斯汀(LloydAustin)在新加坡香格里拉對話會進行場邊會晤。</p>

<p>Ukraine and Russia quickly attributed the disaster to each other. Kiev's officials said that the Moscow's army bombed Russia's dams controlled by Russia before dawn, and Ukrainian President Zellezki pointed his finger at "Russian terrorists".

<p>The size of the water body in the dam in the Hulson area is equivalent to the Da Salt Lake in Utah. Ukraine's main hydropower company Ukraine Water Energy Corporation, the person in charge of Ukraine, said in an interview that the dam exploded at about 2:50 am on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The losses are huge, and the hydropower station cannot be repaired," he said. "The following part has been washed away."</p>

<p>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shohg has accused Ukraine of destroying the dam, because Ukraine can transfer the army and equipment to the front line to help them counterattack. Ukraine said that Russia bombed the dam to prevent the Ukraine troops from crossing the river downstream.</p>
<p>The dam is the southernmost tail of the Dieber River. It was built between 1950 and 1956. It belongs to part of the overall plan to make full use of the economic power of the so -called "Date Dieber". It is located in the downstream of the Zapoli Asia nuclear power plant controlled by Russia, and the nuclear power plant rely on the Khahofka Reservoir to cool its reactor.</p>
<p>Initially, people were worried that if the water level of the river dropped too much, the largest civil nuclear facilities in Europe would not be able to take water, which may cause melting. But Ukraine National Nuclear Energy Power Corporation(Energyatom)It is said in a statement that although the damage to the Zapoli Asia nuclear power plant "may have a negative impact", it has received sufficient water from the nearby pond to cool it.</p>
<p>The statement said: "The situation has been controlled."</p>
<p>Experts are still trying to understand the overall scale of the disaster. The videos verified by the New York Times and pictures on social media showed that the flood drowned the downstream community. In the city controlled by Russia, Mayor Vladimir Kovarianko said that floods flooded houses, affected farmland, blocked the road, and drowned a zoo in the city. The city hall and the cultural palace were also flooded.advertise</p>

Some military analysts warn not to be held accountable according to limited information.</p>
<p>Michael Coofman, a Russian research director in Alington, Virginia, said: "Is Russia's deliberate behavior or the result of negligence and previous dams of dams. It is too early to judge."</p>
<p>"No one eventually benefited from this disaster," Kovman also said. "Russia is responsible because it controls the dam, and its action in Ukraine has led to this result in some way."</p>

<p>Description: Times reporter tried this new product price of $ 3,500 at Apple Silicon Valley headquarters. This device has high -resolution videos, intuitive control and comfortable wearing sense, but it also makes people doubt: Why do we need it? Jim Wilson/The New York Times Apple released a new Vision Pro on Monday. The device will be launched next year.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-07T03-38-35-08-00/06techfix-top-fzqj-master1050.jpg" />On Monday, I was able to take a glimpse of the future calculation of Apple's conception. I tried to wear it for half an hour <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/apple-headset-virtual-reality-wwdc.html">Vision Pro price price $ 3500</a>This is the company's first high -tech head wearing equipment, which will be released next year.</p>
<p>The feeling it left is halfway, including a lingering doubt.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the quality of this device left me a deep impression. Apple called it the beginning of the "space computing" era. In this era, digital data merged with the real world to release new functions. Imagine that wearing heads and equipment to assemble furniture, the instruction manual is projected by numbers to parts, or when cooking, the recipe is displayed on the corner of the eye.</p>
<p>Apple's device has high -resolution videos, intuitive control and comfortable wearing feel, than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/technology/personaltech/quest-pro-review-metaverse.html">META</a>, Magic Leap, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/the-playstation-goggles-are-a-win-for-gamers-not-for-the-metaverse/">Sony</a>It has better experience in the company's wearing equipment in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>But after wearing this new device to see the photo and interact with the virtual dinosaur, I also think there are not many new things here to watch. This experience has triggered the sense of "dislike" that I have never had Apple products. I will introduce it later.</p>
<p><strong> fitting and control </strong></p>
<p>Let me start from scratch. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/apple-headset-virtual-reality-wwdc.html">Apple released this header device on Monday</a>This is the company's first major new product since the Apple Watch was released in 2015. I have been allowed to try the pre -production model of Vision PRO. Apple's staff took me to a private room at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters, and asked me to sit on the sofa to try it.</p>
<p>VisionPro looks like a ski goggle. It has a white USB line that can be connected to a silver battery in my jeans pocket. In order to wear it on my face, I turned a knob on the side of the device to adjust the comfort and fixed a nylon buckle on my head.</p>
<p>I press a metal button on the front of the device to open it. Then I completed a setting process, including looking at a mobile point so that the device can lock my eyeball. VisionPro has a series of sensors to track eye movements, gestures, and voice instructions, which are the main ways to control it. Looking at a icon is equivalent to hovering on the icon with a mouse lantern; if you press the button, you have to touch it with your thumb and your finger fingertips to make a pinch, which is equivalent to clicking the mouse.</p>
<p>The gesture of "pinch" is also used to capture and move applications on the screen. It is very intuitive. Compared to the competitive heading equipment, it usually needs to wield the supporting controller, and it feels not so clumsy.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>But this has also triggered some problems. When playing games, what gestures can we wear equipment? Since Siri's voice transcription function on mobile phones is not good, how good is voice control? Apple is not sure which gesture operations will support, and it has not let me try voice control.</p>
<p><strong> There are so many "many uses"? </strong></p>
<p>Then the application demonstration shows how this header -wearing device enriches our daily life and helps us keep in touch with others.</p>
<p>Apple first took me to see the birthday party photos and videos on the head. I can rotate the turntable near the front of VisionPro on the front of the time to make the background of the photo more transparent. Seeing the real world, including the apple employees around me; if it rotates it clockwise and reduce the transparency of the photo, I can immerse them.</p>
<p>Apple also asked me to open a meditation application in the header device. It will play three -dimensional animation, at the same time play soothing music, and a sound to indicate that I breathe. But meditation cannot make me prepare for the next thing: a video call.</p>
<p>A small window bounced out, and it was Facetime telephone notification from an apple employee wearing an apple employee. I stared at the answer button and pressed the phone.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Apple employees in the video call use a "character", which is her own three -dimensional animation incarnation, which is created by the head through scanning her face. Apple describes the video conference through the character as a more intimate way to communicate or even cooperate in the virtual space.</p>
<p>The facial expression of the Apple employee looks lifelike, and her mouth movement is synchronized with her speech. But because her avatar was rendered by digital technology, her face was uniform and without shadows. I could judge that this was false. It is like I am in the "Minority Report"(Minority Report)Wait for the holographic image seen in science fiction movies.</p>
<p>At the Facetime meeting, I and Apple employees should have cooperated in an application called Freeform to make a three -dimensional model. But I stared blankly and thought about everything I saw. During the epidemic, I was isolated most of my time, and three years later, Apple hoped that I would participate in a deep imitation video of a real person in essence. I can feel that I am closed. My "disgust" may be the "[Horror Valley] described by technical experts for a long time(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)"It is a sense of uneasiness when humans see a machine that looks too much like humans.</p>
<p>A technical masterpiece? Yes. What do I want to use with others every day? May not be temporarily.</p>
<p>In order to draw an interesting end to the demonstration, Apple showed a simulation dinosaur. When I stretched out my hand, it moved to me. I have seen too many digital dinosaurs in virtual reality (in the past seven years, almost every wearing equipment manufacturer who made me a VR demonstration will show a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/technology/personaltech/gear-vr-offers-a-preview-of-virtual-reality-in-the-home.html">Simulation of Jurassic Park</a>), I am not interested in this.</p>
<p><strong> Real people </strong></p>
<p>advertiseDuring dinner, my wife and I talked about Vision Pro. I said that Apple's head and device look better than competing products. But I'm not sure if this is important.</p>
<p>Other head wearing devices from Meta and Sony PlayStation are much cheaper, and they are quite powerful and entertaining, especially when playing video games. However, whenever we invite guests to eat at home, they have lost their interest in less than half an hour. Because this experience makes them exhausted, they feel that they are disconnected from the group.</p>
<p>If they can twist the scales in front of the equipment, can they see the real world when wearing it? I suspect that this is still isolated, because they may be the only person in the room wearing it.</p>
<p>But for me, more importantly, the idea of contacting family, colleagues and others through Apple's head wearing equipment.</p>
<p>"Your mother is old," I said to my wife. "When you chat with her Facetime, are you more willing to see her deep imitation of the digital incarnation, or watch her mobile phone face your face from an awkward angle, talk to you under the bad picture quality?"</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>"The latter," she said without hesitation. "That's real. However, I want to see her more."</p>

<p>Description: The Chinese stock market shock has fallen, reflecting that the feasibility of China ’s economic recovery after the new crowns is becoming increasingly optimistic. Economists have lowered their expectations for growth. Xi Jinping's recent suppression of foreign companies has also harmed investors' confidence.

After nearly three years of popular blockade, China has reopened, and investors expect that the world's second largest economy will recover quickly. The Chinese stock market will soar.</p>
<p>But it's not the case now. This week, Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong have entered a bear market briefly, down more than 20%from January high. The mainland stock market is also falling this year.</p>
<p>For a long time, China has been the driving force for global economic growth, but the decline in the stock market reflects that people's feasibility of China's recovery after the new crown is becoming increasingly optimistic. Although the geopolitical situation between China and the United States continues to be tight, the two countries still have inextricable connections in economics and business.</p>
<p>Teng Yan, an analyst at CMC Markets, New Zealand, said: "All signals from China show that the economic rebound has stumbled and difficult."</p>
<p>Beijing is dealing with consumer expenditures below expected, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZDYhiEUadOKwmOlTc_1QYw">slowing house sales</a>Unpredictable with manufacturing. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20220927/china-renminbi-currency/">Weakened currency</a>Make the problem more complicated. It is not yet sure what actions of the Chinese government may take -if so -to support growth.</p>
<p>Last year, China has implemented blockade measures for many times due to the new crown epidemic, which has caused a heavy blow to the economy. The economic growth is 3%, which is <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230117/china-gdp-fourth-quarter-2022/">the slowest growth rate in decades</a>One is far lower than Beijing's own goals and the growth rate of 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-07T03-40-56-08-00/00china-stocks-04-btcj-master1050.jpg" />The real estate industry has always been the root cause of the pain of stock investors. Developers have bears heavy debt to become the characteristic of the industry. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>Last fall, the authorities introduced stimulus measures to support the real estate industry, which brought shock to the stock market. With the sudden end of the "clear zero" policy, another impact appeared in December. The stock market rose into a new year and reached its peak at the end of January.</p>
<p>In the first three months of this year, China's economy has increased <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230418/china-gdp-q1-2023/">4.5%</a>(Most of them are from consumption) and seem to be walking into the recovery track. In recent months, the expenditure has been strong, especially in <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/style/20230504/china-luxury-spending/">luxury</a>And <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0509/c98649-20016141.html">food and beverage industry</a>, But it is increasingly not to meet the expectations of investors. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230522/china-youth-unemployment/">High -loss rate of young people</a>Make the prospects even more bleak.</p>
<p>In Western countries and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/business/eurozone-inflation-may.html">Inflation</a>At the same time as struggle, China is dealing with the opposite of it and may be more harmful, that is, dragging the economy due to the sustainable low prices that suppress the company's profits and wages.</p>
<p>"Domestic demand is still weak," Teng Yan said.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>Therefore, in recent weeks, many economists have lowered their expectations and led to the decline in the stock market. However, some analysts, including Nomura Securities and Barclays Bank analysts -still expected that the growth rate of domestic GDP this year will be higher than 5%of government forecasts.</p>
<p>People in the world's largest economy in the world are relatively low, but the performance of the US stock market is far better than China. The S &amp; P 500 has risen by about 12%this year.</p>
<p>The CCP and its supreme leader Xi Jinping recently decided to hurt the stock market emotions. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230515/china-anti-espionage-law/">Customs with a consulting company that is associated with overseas</a>Some foreign companies and investors panic, which once again caused people to question the feasibility of international companies' business in China.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-07T03-40-56-08-00/00china-stocks-03-btcj-master1050.jpg" />Consumer spending has been strong in recent months, but it is getting lower and lower than the expectations of investors. Qilai shen for the new york times</p>
<p>"The recovery has stagnated, partly because Beijing cannot boost the confidence of consumers and business investors," the economist of Nomura Securities wrote in a report last month. "With the emergence of disappointment, we see that the risk of spiral decline risk rises, leading to weak activity data, rising unemployment rates, continuous deflation, decline in market interest rates and soft currencies."</p>
<p>However, some observers believe that investors have just misjudged the unprecedented re -opening up of the Chinese economy. And they ignored the authorities to put national security issues in <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20230515/china-xi-security-economy/">economic issues</a>The change above.</p>
<p>"The idea of China's economic management method has been completely different," said Liang Zhaoyi, chief Chinese economist of Star Fair Bank. He also said that the authorities are unlikely to respond to the stock market plunge by taking positive measures as in the past. Beijing's policy makers are more concerned about the vane of the economy and other economies. Liang Zhaoyi said that from this perspective, the Chinese economy is "not too outrageous."</p>
<p>advertiseAt present, investors continue to sell Chinese stocks. The largest losers this year, including online retailers Jingdong and Hot Pot Chain Haidilao, have fallen by more than 20%this year, prompting <a href="https://www.hsi.com.hk/eng/indexes/all-indexes/hscei?from=companyhomepages.com">Hong Kong Hang Seng China Enterprise Index</a>Thursday fell to the minimum closing level during the year.

<p>The real estate industry continues to make investors feel pain. According to data released by China Real Estate Information Group this week, the real estate sales of the 100 largest companies in May decreased by about 14%from the previous month.</p>
<p>China’s <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230526/china-housing-crisis-nanchang/">Real Estate Problem</a>——The developers are trapped in debt, leaving the loan buyers an unfinished apartment -leading to people expect that the People's Bank of China will have to cut interest rates this year.</p>
<p>Both Nomura Securities and Barclays all predict that in the three months of June, China's economic growth rate will increase significantly -close to 8%. According to the predictions of these two companies, the growth of the next two quarters this year will slow down to the earlier level this year.</p>
<p>In the process, analysts expect the stock market performance will improve. "Excessive pessimistic emotions usually modify themselves," Liang Zhaoji said.</p>

India puts a large number of public resources into a new train. However, for trains that have been running on the track, safety guarantee funds are much more tense. Essence</p>
<p>On Sunday, at least 275 people died in eastern India <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/03/world/asia/india-train-crash.html">heavy train accident</a>After that, these decisions became particularly concerned, which was the most serious railway accident in the country for many years. Investigators said that their focus was on the possibility of signal faults that caused the collision of three trains on Friday.</p>
<p>The authorities said that at the time of the accident, a row drove south to Jinsai City's passenger train at a speed of 128 kilometers per hour <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/04/world/asia/india-train-crash-cause.html">turning the wrong track, hitting a static truck</a>Essence The accident also injured more than 1,100 people. The first train's derailment compartment then hit the second passenger trains driven to it, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/world/asia/india-train-crash.html">causing a terrible scene</a>Essence</p>
<p>In the past few years, India has been unprecedentedly improving infrastructure in a state of riots for a long time, and Indian railways, which occupy the core position in the world's fifth largest economy, have always been the main beneficiary. In the previous fiscal year, the government spent nearly $ 30 billion on the railway system, an increase of 15%over the previous year.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>But the costs used for basic track maintenance and other security measures have been declining. The Indian Audit Office (an independent agency) last year <a href="https://cag.gov.in/webroot/uploads/download_audit_report/2022/Report-No.-22-of-2022_Railway_English_DSC-063a2dda55f3ce6.38649271.pdf">Report</a>It is found that the funds allocated to the maintenance and maintenance of the line have decreased, and officials did not even spend all the funds reserved.</p>
<p>India has more than 20 million passengers on the railway every day, many of them are migrant workers. Politicians will not invest a lot of funds on the railway system. Prime Minister Narendra Modi does this, and he does not hesitate. This year, the Indian railway -one of the largest railway systems in the world -the budget was five times when he took office.</p>
<p>But Modi's most measures are not aimed at the basic steps required from one place to run from one place to another, but to improve the speed and comfort. He often praises new types of VANDEBHARAT electric trains connecting large cities and higher fares, and listed a high -speed railway project built with Japanese Shinkansen technology as priority, although it has no help to improve the lives of ordinary Indian passengers.</p>
<p>The Indian government said the investment was to help improve the experience of taking the Indian railway to the world -class level and attract overseas investment.</p>

<p>However, according to the recently announced budget, the proportion of project expenditures for improving the safety of more than 13,000 old trains in India has been declining in total expenditure, and even the absolute value is declining.</p>
<p>Patti Muhopadier, a senior researcher at the New Delhi Policy Research Center, specifically mentioned a demand. "The signal function may require more attention," he said. "From a strategic point of view, signals are a kind of soft ability supplement. As we turn to a higher speed train, the signal will become more important."</p>

<p>Despite the severe casualties in the collision accident on Friday, India's railway travel is still much safer than ever.</p>
<p>In this country, the derailment accident was quite frequent. From 1980 to Century, an average of 475 occurred each year. According to the [File] submitted by railway officials at the World Disaster Management Conference(https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9Pi0EAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)In the ten years before 2021, this number dropped to more than 50.</p>
<p>India's railway safety has also been widely improved, and the number of serious accidents has steadily decreased: from more than 300 starting and landing 20 years ago to 22 fiscal year. By 2020, India has not died in a railway accident for two consecutive years. This is a milestone celebrating the Modi government. Until 2017, more than 100 passengers were killed every year in India.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Modi, India has been spending a lot. The Ministry of Finance and the World Bank hope that private enterprises can follow the government's approach and inject more funds into the economy. The World Bank pointed out in a report in April that the Indian government's expenditure in achieving long -term goals "increased from the level before the epidemic." The transportation including the railway plays an important role in the surge in the expenditure.</p>
<p>"In the 21st century, for the rapid development of the country, the growth and reform of the railway are crucial," last year, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/centre-transforming-railway-infra-by-making-record-investment-pm-modi-122123000829_1.html">Modi said at the completion ceremony of a railway line</a>Essence "A nationwide railway reconstruction movement is in progress."</p>

The opposition politicians and former Minister of Railway Marta Marta Banaja caught this.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for Mother's Day, and a mother left the world, making people feel sad.</p>
<p>On June 2, a mother in Wuhan lost his 6 -year -old only child and was said to have subsequently suffered a Internet violence and jumped off the building from the high place on the 24th floor to commit suicide. In the time without news, this incident has detonated almost the attention of the whole people. What do you think?</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a tragedy. The 6 -year -old child was crushed to death by the teacher who was driving on the campus, and his mother finally chose to commit suicide while asking the way. A series of tragedies naturally guide a problem, that is, who killed this mother? According to the current report, most people think that the reason is the Internet violence, but as far as the current disclosed materials are concerned, the logic of the Internet storm and suicide actually requires more information. But from this case, we might as well explore the formation mechanism of cyber storms.</p>
<hr />
<p>Humanity: Ordinary people will also do evil</p>
<p>Other people else.</p>
<p>Why is cyber storm so common? It is generally that many people don't even think that their behavior is Internet storm. According to the most widespread definition of cyber violence, abuse, attack, insult, and slander are also considered. As long as the behavior of privacy, personal security, and their normal life threatening or some adverse effects are online storms.</p>
<p>The birth mechanism of cyber storms is closely related to the characteristics of the network. A major feature of the Internet is anonymous, which makes most people seem to have no psychological burden when doing evil. Many studies have shown that in anonymous, many people are more inclined to destroy rules. Another major characteristic of the Internet is the community, and any part is a crowd of the ocean -like sea. This makes Internet violence often do not consider themselves to be on the Internet storm, but stand on justice or power. , Secretly throwing a stone -but maybe in case of such possibilities, a post becomes a straw of the emotional collapse of the parties. After all, every snowflake is not innocent when the avalanche occurs.</p>
<p>In addition to the help of social media, behind the Internet storm is the manifestation of human evil. Human nature has a lot of yin. In fact, it is impossible to be tested. Under very cases such as war, it can be said that there will be evil under authoritative instructions, but in a state of non -war, it will actually be evil. In psychology, there was a famous experiment called Stanford Prison experiment, that is, simulated a prison, allowing a group of college student volunteers to guest prisoners and prison guards. The experiment lasted for two weeks. During this period, the prison guards must maintain order and have the right to do anything. The prisoners and prison guards are volunteers of college students. It can be said that everyone knows that everyone is here to conduct experiments. Originally, they thought that there was not much accident. It was nothing more than a game. However, in the experiment, the direction of the matter was unexpected, that is, the prison guards "worked hard" to do a lot of things. Punishment such as detained and tortured prisoners took turns. Practice. In this way, the experiment was forced to terminate in less than a week, because the situation continued to go out of control.</p>
<p>Although the Stanford Prison Experiment is in the era of the Internet, it vividly revealed a vividly, that is, how to make people addicted to it, and ordinary people will be happy to lose restraint. In the era of social media, the characteristics of human nature overlay network characteristics make it difficult to curb online storms.</p>
<p><strong> Social media: Emotional amplifier </strong></p>
<p>Of course, criticism of Internet violence is easy, but it is difficult to prevent Internet violence, especially before the truth is completely restored.</p>
<p>To criticize the Internet violence, it is better to reflect on, why do Internet storms repeatedly appear? It can be said that there must be some mechanism behind this repetition -that is, social media is actually based on consumer emotions. To put it a little bit, whether this emotion is an entertainment carnival during the Internet violence, or the sense of justice of critical cyber storms, it is essentially emotional. Angry, anxiety, desire, etc., are the dark aspects of human emotions. The absorption of social media algorithms to absorb and magnify such emotions is its laws of survival. Don't talk about online storms. Most occupations exposed under social media often need to sacrifice some emotions. For example, the hottest live broadcast now looks like you can make money when you buy and buy in front of the camera. Emotional value. According to industry standards, the life cycle of a cargo anchor is only a few months. There are very few people who can surpass this cycle, and often pay a lot of money behind them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem is not only for social media of consumer emotions, but also its single nature. For example, why can only such negative emotions be enlarged infinitely? Why is the correction function of different opinions, why is it exhausted? In other words, how can the mechanism of cyber storm be amplified? These issues have been investigated, and they have exceeded the category of Internet violence, pointing to the survival dilemma of our time.</p>
<p><strong> Typhoon: How to face online storms </strong></p>
<p>When many people talk about other people's Internet storms, they always say that this is just online gossip, but this kind of remark actually ignores the strong lethality behind the Internet storm -when the mental backlog of tens of millions of people is on a person, the destruction is beyond excess. It is expected that suicide people are not all fragile.</p>
<p>Inside, I have to say that stereotypes have played a role. There are also tragedies like Wuhan's loss of independence abroad. When this kind of tragedy appears, the public actually has some psychological expectations. For example, in the expectations of Volkswagen, the family members of the victims seem to be sad. In this way, this is in line with the stereotypes of everyone in tragic characters, and it can also let the public sprinkle their sympathy. Conversely, family members are rational and correct their rights. This does not meet the stereotypes of the victims in the public impression, which often causes boundless doubts, whether for motivation or other. But in fact, for family members, after encountering tragedy, choosing to restrain sadness and defending their rights is actually more difficult, but it is also more correct -it can be said that the previous performance of Wuhan's mother is very decent. But it is likely that this decent restraint stimulates the audience who looks forward to seeing tears and collapse. The problem is that family members do not exist in order to satisfy the public's cheap sympathy. The first goal is to pursue justice, even if this fairness often appears in the form of compensation.</p>
<p>When it comes to cyber storms, it is imperative to improve the network environment, and it is more important to establish a tolerant public opinion environment than measures such as the titles. The tolerance environment can encourage more rational and kind voices to emerge. In every social hotspot, you can expect that these rational and kind voices will eventually win and play a role in eliminating disinfecting and correction.</p>
<p>In the current environment, it is difficult to improve macro improvement overnight. For individuals, it may be more meaningful to improve from the micro -improvement. The Internet always has memories, and social media is always invading our lives, so it is necessary to cultivate a healthy social media habit. Understand social media characteristics and risks, beware of personal privacy and information leakage, and prevent mobile phones from being obsessed with mobile phones. Many parents have advice on their children, but in fact, parents themselves should comply with these suggestions.You may know who this foreigner is, but in reality, it does not necessarily need to be so great to stand up. Sometimes the greatness may be that you do n’t do anything. Human nature is malicious, but many times the human nature is also kind. A benign society needs to surpass the cooperation and trust of the acquaintance society. This is the so -called "compassion of strangers" by writers. ** Note: This article only represents the author's own point of view. Xu Jin is the "important economy" in the WeChat public account.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T04-09-00-04-00/000000.png" />On June 7, nearly 13 million middle school graduates participated in the college entrance examination, which was the largest number of people in China for more than 40 years. Police were ordered to provide students with various conveniences. <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06072023040907.html/@@images/image"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T04-09-00-04-00/000001.png" /></a>Associated Press data chart <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06072023040907.html/@@stream">Audio-Link: https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibao/kejiaowen/gt1-0607202307.html/@stream</a>Nearly 13 million Chinese candidates participated in the college entrance examination on Wednesday. Related topics appeared on the Weibo hot search list. Each portal website issued the latest news about the college entrance examination. The parents of the students hope that their children will win, and the police will also solve their problems for candidates and turn on the green lights. However, some scholars believe that the Chinese -style education and college entrance examination systems have problems that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/5-06012023124013.html"><strong> After the clearance is over, the first college entrance examination can decide whether to wear a mask by themselves </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/kw-01302023102808.html">From Hengshui Second Middle School to Henan Yasheng Sisi authoritarian violence, why do you run across the campus? </a></strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday morning (7th), the annual college entrance examination kicked off every year. There are more than 14,000 candidates in Haidian District, Beijing, and the number of candidates accounts for about a quarter of the city, ranking first in the city. There are 24 test sites in Haidian District and 482 formal test rooms. According to the police, the intelligent test paper tracking system was installed in advance on each test paper. Entering the vehicle, the shipping, and delivery test point from the test paper, the test center will be returned in real time.</p>
<p>Beijing independent scholar Wu Qiang said in an interview on the day that this year was the "Cultural Revolution" this year, and the number of people participating in the college entrance examination has been resumed for more than 40 years since the "Cultural Revolution". He said that for the parents of the students, this was carried out in the case of difficulty in the employment situation of undergraduate graduates.</p>
<p>He said: "Young people are going to college now, will they face the same employment difficulties four years later? Especially for parents, facing the break of middle -class production, just like we have seen a lot of news this year. Migrant workers, worked hard to send their children to college. As a result, the graduated children re -engaged in their father's occupation and the occupation of urban migrant workers, such as sending takeaways. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T04-09-00-04-00/000002.png" />Some students went to the wrong test room, and the police arranged for the candidate to transfer the examination room.

<p>According to reports, on June 7, a candidate who took the wrong test room was escorted by the Beijing traffic police car and iron cyclone and successfully sent it to the examination room. In Luoyang, Henan, a candidate found that he had walked the wrong test room. The Luoyang Police Iron Riding Brigade dispatched two motorcycles and sent the candidates to the candidates in ten minutes. In Hefei and Xuancheng, Anhui, some candidates lost their admission ticket. The Hefei police opened a "green channel" and made a temporary ID card for him in just ten minutes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the entrance of the 26th middle school entrance examination site in Xi'an City, Shaanxi, parents spontaneously put on cheongsam to discuss candidates a good color to start.</p>
<p>Wu Qiang believes that in fact, there is great contradictions and conflicts between the emerging middle class and reproduction of the Chinese college entrance examination and the national elite production. It has reflected and exploded with the decline of education and training, real estate and other industries, and the white paper revolution.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that there are many problems in China's education system, and the most prominent of which is the college entrance examination system. The college entrance examination pays too much attention to scores and ignores the training of students' comprehensive quality. Many students give up opportunities for other extracurricular activities, social practice and other opportunities to pursue good results. This has led to their lack of innovative spirit and practical ability, and it is difficult to compete for various tasks after entering college or workplace.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T04-09-00-04-00/000004.png" />Chinese students have been in the cold windows for ten years, waiting for the college to be admitted to college, and they have suffered great psychological pressure. (Weibo screenshot/ancient pavilion) <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/kejiaowen/gt1-06072023040907.html/m0607-gt1p3.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T04-09-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a><strong> Some subjects in the university are detached from reality for learning. </strong></p>
<p>Feng Chongyi, an associate professor of the University of Science and Technology of Sydney (UTS) in Australia, believes that most people in China, especially farmers, generally believe that the college entrance examination is the only way to change destiny, so it is huge, but the employment prospects of students after graduation are dim. He said to this station: "Reading back in a few years, there is no advantage, and many majors are not supported now, especially some so -called 985 colleges are still designed with learning curriculum, so it is not adapted to society. Can't find the corresponding job. "</p>
<p>Feng Chongyi said that in China, if students are not admitted to college, they may be included in the so -called low -end population. In contrast, there is at least opportunities for admission to college.Mr. Wang said that the Chinese education system is the continuation of the imperial examination system, which is incompatible with the needs of today's era. The government should carry out reforms to meet the development needs of the times, and should pay attention to cultivating students' comprehensive quality and innovative spirit.</p>

<h1>The World Bank warns that the global economy is still unstable, and this year and next year have grown slowly</h1>

<p>Description: In the latest report, the World Bank warned that due to the rise in interest rates to slow consumer expenditure and corporate investment, and threatened the stability of the financial system, the global economy will grow slowly in the past two years. But the bank made a more optimistic prediction of China's economic trends. Charlotte de La Fuente for the New York Times Factory. Rising interest rates may slow down the output of industries around the world, both in developed or developing economies.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-07T04-28-40-08-00/06dc-globalecon-ptwh-master1050.jpg" />The World Bank said on Tuesday that the global economy is still in a "unstable state" and warned that the economy will grow slowly today, because the rise in interest rates has slowed consumer expenditure and corporate investment, and threatened the stability of the financial system.</p>
<p>The Winjin forecast made by the World Bank in the latest "Global Economic Outlook" report highlights the dilemma faced by global policy makers. They try to curb stubborn inflation by increasing interest rates. The supply chain continues to be turbulent.</p>
<p>The World Bank is expected to slow from 3.1%in 2022 to 2.1%this year. This is slightly higher than the 1.7%of its January forecast, but now it is expected that the output will rise to 2.4%in 2024, which is lower than the 2.7%predicted by the World Bank.</p>
<p>Aihan Cos, Deputy Economist of the World Bank Group Group, said: "The global economy we saw earlier this year is fading, and the days in front of them may be dark."</p>
<p>Cos said that the world economy is undergoing "sharp and synchronized global slowing", and 65%of the country's growth will be lower than last year. The poor fiscal management of low -income countries dependent on loans has made the problem more complicated. According to the World Bank data, 14 of the 28 low -income countries are in debt dilemma or are facing high risks in debt dilemma.</p>
<p>The recent pressure of the United States and European banking industry has led to the closure of banks with the largest scale since the financial crisis in 2008, diluing the optimistic emotions of this year's economic rebound. Farewell to the health status of the banking industry has prompted many lenders to stop providing credit to enterprises and individuals. The World Bank stated that this phenomenon may further drag economic growth.</p>
<p>The bank also warned that the rising loan costs of rich countries have brought additional resistance to the poorest economy in the world. The former includes the United States, which has exceeded 5%for the first time in 15 years in 15 years.</p>
<p>The report warned that the most vulnerable economy faced a greater risk of financial crisis due to rising interest rates. Higher interest rates make the cost of repaying loans in developing countries. If its currency depreciates, the cost of imported food is higher.</p>
<p>In addition to the risks brought about by rising interest rates, the common role of major epidemics and the conflict of Ukraine has made the global poverty reduction fields retreating for decades. The World Bank estimates on Tuesday that by 2024, the revenue of the most poor countries will decrease by 6%compared to 2019.</p>
<p>The report states: "Today's emerging markets and development economies are just supporting support. They have been deprived of funds for creating employment opportunities and providing basic services to the most vulnerable citizens."</p>
<p>The World Bank also sees that developed economies generally slow down. In the United States, it is expected to increase by 1.1%this year and 0.8%in 2024.</p>
<p>China is an obvious exception to this trend. After several years of strict new crowns, the re -opening up of China's economy is supporting global growth. The bank is expected to increase by 5.6%this year and will increase by 4.6%next year.</p>
<p>It is expected that inflation will continue to slow this year, but the World Bank is expected that by 2024, the prices of many countries will still be higher than the central bank's goal.</p>

According to reports, data released by market monitoring agencies show that the transaction area of the first -tier cities in May in May decreased by 12.8%month -on -month, and only Guangzhou rose slightly from the previous month. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the overall transaction of the property market in April has fallen significantly. From the perspective of first -tier cities, the decline in the property market is very obvious, and there is also differentiation.</p>
<p>As the wind direction of the property market, Shanghai has recently fallen further.

<p>Xue Yating, a person in the real estate industry in Shanghai, told this station that many merchants moved away from office buildings to seek cheap units to continue their operation: "Now everyone is in a state of panic, you have seen big data on the Internet. About 10,000 yuan and thousands of dollars are in short supply. It may be that businesses want to move to cheap places, and large units cannot be rented. I have not disclosed it online in this regard. "</p>
<p>The NetEase public account "Uncle Han Chat Investment" sent a video saying that the vacancy rate of office buildings in Shanghai is now high: "Now the vacancy rate is high, listening to my friend said that a company was rented out in a office building near their company.

The price was affordable. I can't see a few companies, a depression. "</p>
<p><strong> Official media promotes first -tier cities' real estate loosening </strong></p>
<p>The China Economic Times reported on Tuesday (6th) that the real estate restrictions on first -tier cities should be adjusted in a timely manner. It is reported that with the gradual establishment of the "housing and not stir -fry" mechanism, adjustments such as restrictions on purchase restrictions should be "optimized" in a timely manner until the exit, and it should be replaced with a stable and institutionalized long -term mechanism. In this regard, some comments believe that in the face of the depression of the current real estate market, first -tier cities may relax the restrictions on house purchase.</p>
<p>However, businessman Lin believes that as foreign companies evacuate the headquarters from Shanghai, many foreigners leave. Even if he was a high education, he couldn't find a job. He said to this station: "It's not good or bad. It is not good. The children of several non -staple food shop owners at the door graduated from college. , I ca n’t find a job for more than a year. I washed the dishes in the restaurant at home to help the guests. This economic environment will become worse and worse, because the Communist Party cannot change the status quo. "</p>
<p>At present, some second -tier cities have started a new round of loosening real estate policy, such as relaxation restrictions, provident fund policies, and house purchase subsidies.</p>

This number has imbalanced food and energy supply and demand. The United Nations predicts that the global population will increase to 9.7 billion in the middle of this century.</p>
<p>John Kerry said in an interview with the media today: "I personally think that the situation will be discharged. We need to figure out how to deal with perpetual problems, and how many people we can raise on the earth."</p>

The Parisagreement Agreement in 2015 with a milestone significance in various countries agrees to control the global average heating in the range of up to 2 degrees Celsius compared with the previous industrial era, and strives to pursue continuity to reduce reduction. Within 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>The production of foods for 8 billion people accounts for more than 1/4 of the gas emissions of greenhouses. Breeding livestock, waste of food and forest cutting further exacerbate climate warming problems, and warming also leads to drought, floods and extreme weather.</p>
<p>Kerry said: "I have been to many African countries. They are very proud of their fertility rate, but the fact is that it is difficult to sustain such a life today, let alone add future numbers."</p>
<p>Experts said that Africa is one of the areas with the most serious affected climate change, and devastating droughts and floods have occurred. Although African citizens have little effect on global warming compared with Western countries. Avoid aviation travel, eat less meat, and improve house insulation, which will help protect the environment.</p>

This nutritional guidelines will reduce red meat intake to less than 500 grams per week. But Kerry did not intend to call on people to give up their burgers. He said: "I think these choices depend on people themselves, what they want to do, and what they want to do. I suggest that we want to change the way to feed livestock, think about what to feed them, and how our animal husbandry." Kerryti To the so -called animal husbandry method refers to new technologies that reduce negative impacts on the environment. Kerry said, "I don't think you have to sacrifice your lifestyle in order to complete what we need to do. You can have a better way of lifestyle and eat better food. If we no longer waste so many foods, we can support it more Many people. "</p>

<p>As the dam has been defeated, the large land of the downstream large land is flooded. The area located on the other side of the Hermuson (east bank) is actually a restricted area for the Ukrainian armored forces.</p>
<p><strong> After an important Ukrainian dam occupied by Russia, thousands of people are evacuating from the lower reaches of the dam. Russia and Ukraine accused each other the culprit that bombed the dam. </strong></p>
<p>Ukrainian President Zeleguski said that after the dam of Novakakhovka was destroyed, 80 towns and villages may be overwhelmed, and he blamed Russia. The rolling river is pouring into the De Nieberg River, and it is said that it has constituted a fatal risk of floods in Hermone.</p>
<p>Russia denied destroy this dam that was controlled and accused of being caused by Ukraine shells.</p>
<p>Kiev and Moscow have accused each other on the dam, and the claims of the two parties have not been confirmed by the BBC.</p>
<p>The KakhovkareServoir, located in the huge KakhovkareServio, is vital to the region. The reservoir provides water for local farmers and residents, and also provides water sources for Zaporizhzhia Nuclear PowerPlant. It is also an important channel for water transmission to southern Crimea occupied by Russia.</p>
<p>Ukraine State -owned Hydropower Management Institutions warned that the peak period of the downstream of the reservoir discharge on Wednesday (June 7), local time. Subsequently, it will enter a "stable period", and the water level is expected to drop rapidly within four to five days.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/_130015404_graphic_flood.png" />However, all circles have paid attention to the situation of how unexpectedly influenced the largest Zapolo nuclear power plant in Europe, because the nuclear power plant uses the water in the reservoir to cool down.</p>
<p>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the situation of the place is controlled, and the nuclear security "currently there is no immediately risk."</p>
<p>The video showed that the flood was over the dam, several towns have been flooded, and residents in downstream areas are forced to escape by bus and train.</p>

<p>The video showed that the flood was over the dam, several towns have been flooded, and residents in downstream areas are forced to escape by bus and train.</p>
<p>Ukraine Deputy Chief Captain Litvinova said on Ukraine TV that about 40,000 people need to evacuate, of which there are 17,000 people in the Western Region of the Denber River controlled by Ukraine and 25,000 people in the eastern region controlled by Russia.</p>
<p>Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Cryenco, who also spoke on Ukraine TV, said that about 1,000 people have been evacuated so far, and 24 settlements have been flooded. He accused Russia of artillery in the southern part of Hermuson. The region was evacuating personnel and warned that the exposed mines will bring danger after the water level rises.</p>
<p>A resident named Andre lived in a area near the dam. The dam was occupied by the Russian army shortly after Russia launched a comprehensive invasion in February 2022. He expressed his believe in Russia to "flood" his city.</p>
<p>In the Ukraine -controlled Helson, a lady named Su Demira is loading her items, including a washing machine to a trailer connected to a classic car. She said, "We are afraid of floods. We are moving things to high."</p>
<p>She urged the Russian army to "drive out ... they shot at us. They are drowning us and doing other bad things."</p>
<p>Another resident of the city also told BBC that he was worried that "everything here would be destroyed." He said: "All creatures, including humans, will be drowned by the water." He pointed at the nearby nearby. Houses and gardens signal.</p>

He said that the authorities would send 53 evacuation bus to send people with two settlements and two nearby settlements to safe areas. He added that the water level has risen to more than 11 meters, and some people have been taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>Officials assigned by the Kremlin said that the town Oleshky was also affected by serious floods.</p>
<p>The Kazkova Dibrozoo, located on the banks occupied by Russia, have been completely overwhelmed. The zoo said on its Facebook page that 300 animals in the park have died.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the dam was destroyed in the early morning of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence department accused Russia of intentionally bombing the dam.</p>
<p>This statement seems to be reasonable because Moscow may worry that the Ukrainian army will use the road on the dam to enter the territory they control, as part of the counterattack operation.Image source, getty images</p>

<p>Moscow may worry that the Ukrainian army will use the road on the dam to enter the territory controlled by Russia as part of the counterattack.</p>
<p>For Moscow, which is eager to keep in the southern Ukraine, this dam has become a problem that needs to be faced. Just like last fall, the Ukraine's road and railway bridge on the lower reaches of the dam, successfully isolated the Russian troops around Hermone, Moscow may decide to destroy the dam to stop Ukraine's counterattack.</p>
<p>They are worried that Ukraine's counterattack may come from multiple directions.</p>
<p>However, a Russian official claimed that Ukraine attacked the dam in order to divert the attention of the failure of its counterattack and deprive Crimea (in 2014 by Russia's illegal swallowing) freshwater supply.</p>
<p>It is always expected that Ukraine will launch a major counterattack. Kiev said that it would not start a warning offensive in advance, but recently, Ukrainian military activities have increased signs that the outside world is considered a counterattack may have begun.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Zerrenji said that the damage of the dam will not prevent Ukraine. He published a film conversation saying: "We will still liberate our land."</p>
<p>Earlier that day, Zelei held an emergency meeting of the National Security and National Defense Commission to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>Ukraine Deputy Minister of Defense, Hannamalia, said on Monday (June 5) that the Ukrainian army's offense around Bachurut's "enemy activity center" made progress. But she did not say whether the counterattack operation had begun.</p>
<p>In fact, Bachurut has been the center of fierce fighting for several months. It has little strategic value, but has important symbolic significance in Kiev and Moscow.</p>
<p>Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, a consultant of the Ministry of Defense, Yurisak, accepted an exclusive interview with BBC Fourth Radio "Today" that according to their telephone eavesdropping, Russia hopes to target more dams. He said: "They actually called for the bombing of more Dieberg dams."</p>
<p>Ukraine referred to the dams of the dam as an ecological disaster, and said that the 150 tons of engine oil leaked into the Dieber River. Ukraine Hydropower said that a power station related to the dam has been "completely destroyed ... the water conservancy structure has been washed away."</p>

<p>All circles are very concerned about how accidents affect the largest Zapolo nuclear power plant in Europe, because the nuclear power plant uses the water in the reservoir to cool down.</p>
<p>International leaders blame the explosion on Russia, and some people call it the crime of war. British Prime Minister Sonak (Xin Weicheng) said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam, it means that people will witness "Russia's aggression has reached a new low."</p>
<p>NATO Secretary -General Stoltenberg criticized that the damage of the dam once again shows the brutal behavior of Russia in the Ukrainian war, while the European Council Chairman Michelle said that he was shocked by the "unprecedented attack".</p>
<p>The Geneva Convention clearly prohibits the target of dams in the war because it is dangerous to civilians.</p>
<p>In the past, a dam in Ukraine was destroyed and caused a disaster: in August 1941, with the advancement of the Germans, the Soviets quickly retreated in Ukraine. The military commander decided to destroy the bridge and dam of Zapolo to prevent the enemy from crossing the Dieber River. Civilians are not warned, and historians estimate that at least 3,000 people are killed.</p>
<h3>Is the dam of the dam?</h3>
<p>Professor Trysey Jendan from the Department of National Defense Research at King London said that the dam is a civil infrastructure and is usually not an effective military goal. She said: "In the armed conflict law, assuming that there is a Ukrainian military unit in the dam. Then, Russia can regard it as a military goal. But as far as I know, the situation is not the case."</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Elis, executive director of the International Lawyers Association, said: "Out of military needs, civil targets such as dams must be attacked; This will violate international law. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/_105914180_line976-nc.png" /></p>
<h3>Analysis: Who will benefit from the damage of this dam?</h3>
<p><strong> BBC reporter Frank Gardner </strong> **</p>
<p>In the case of Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of the shot of the dam, people remind people of the "Beixi" natural gas pipeline explosion of the unsolved mystery last year.</p>
<p>In these two cases, the West immediately doubted to Russia. But Moscow responded twice: "It's not us. Why do we do this? This harms our own interests!"</p>
<p>Now, in the case of the Carthova dam being penetrated, Russia can point out two damage to its own interests.</p>
<p>The floods of the downstream land forced Russia to evacuate the army and civilians eastward, away from the bank of the River River and the wide Timber River. This will provide some limited relief for Holson's residents, and they have always lived under Russia's shelling and missile attacks.</p>
<p>Secondly, this may affect the water supply of Crimea occupied by Russia. Crimea is a drought peninsula that depends on a canal near this dyke.</p>
<p>Since Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, the peninsula has become a land defense of heavy soldiers, and both Russia and Ukraine claim to have sovereignty.</p>
<p>However, the Khahofka Dam's damping needs to be placed in the wider context of the Ukrainian war, especially when the Ukrainian summer counterattack has shown that it has begun.</p>
<p>[Video-Link:/WS/AV-EMBEDS/CPS/ZHONGWEN/SIMP/World-65831170/P0FNC5CG/ZH-HansS]](https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/cps/zhongwen/simp/world-65831170/p0fnc5cg/zh-hans)<img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/p0fnc60j.jpg" /><strong> Your equipment does not support playing multimedia materials </strong> video plus injection text,</p>
<p>The Russian and Ukraine War: a counterattack that may change the war</p>
<p>In order to make this counterattack successful, Ukraine needs to break Russia's suppression of a large land occupied last year. This land connects Crimea with the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine. If Ukraine can find a strategy and successfully break through the Russian army defense line in southern Suparzhia, and divide the area into two, then Crimea can beolate and achieve a major strategic victory.</p>
<p>But since the full invasion of February last year, Russia has learned a lot of lessons: Moscow saw the map, calculated the most likely places for Ukraine to attack, and built a truly powerful defense work in the past few months, blocking Ukraine's towards the direction of Ukraine. Any action of Azahai's offense.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/BBC Chinese/2023-06-07T08-07-41.000Z/_130011905_dam.jpg" />Image source, reuters</p>
<p>Image adding text,</p>
<p>As the dam has been decided, the large land of the downstream is flooded.</p>
<p>Now, as the dam has been defeated, the downstream large land is flooded, and the area located on the other side of Hermuson (east bank) has actually become the restricted area for the Ukrainian armored forces.</p>
<p>There is a historical note that Russia does have similar behaviors in this area. In 1941, the Soviet army bombed the dam on the same one of the Diebero River to block the forward of the Nazis. Thousands of Soviet citizens were said to be killed in subsequent floods.</p>
<p>However, the current bottom line is, no matter who has broken through the Carhofka dam now, it has disrupted the strategic chessboard in southern Ukraine and forced the two parties to make a series of major strategic adjustments. The next step in.</p>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Paris, 6th) Scientists said today that no matter how human beings work hard to reduce carbon pollution that leads to global warming, the Arctic Ocean Ice Cjid will disappear as soon as the summer of the 2030s, 10 years earlier than expected.</p>

<p>The joint author of the report and the University of Hamburg's Institute of Oceanography, Dirknotz, told AFP that "the protection of the Arctic Summer Sea Ice as a landscape and habitat was too late to protect the AFNOTZ. It's. "</p>
<p>"Because of our discharge of greenhouse gases, the climate system losses will be the first main part."</p>
<p>Over time, the reduction of ice lids will have a serious impact on weather, human and ecosystems, which not only impacts to the Arctic region, but also affects all over the world.</p>
<p>Seung-Kimin, the main author of the report and the main author of the report, told the AFP that "the permanent frozen soil layer will accelerate global warming worldwide because of the melting of greenhouse gas, and" The melting of Greenland ice cover will cause sea levels to rise. "</p>
<p>The Greenland ice cover with a few kilometers, the amount of frozen water contained in it is enough to lift the sea plane 6 meters.</p>
<p>Min Shengji said that in the 2030s (Arctic Ocean) September, "IPCC's recent predictions for the interglmed climate of the United Nations scientific consulting institutions (IPCC) were recently earlier for 10 years."</p>
<p>The United Nations "Inter -Government Climate Change Problem Group" in 2021 a milestone report "Highly confidently" predict that by the middle of this century, the Arctic Ocean will appear at least one stateless state.</p>
<p>The minimum ice area of the Arctic Creation record was 3.4 million square kilometers, which occurred in 2012, while the second and third low -ice coverage appeared in 2020 and 2019, respectively.</p>
<p>If the ice coverage area of the Arctic Ocean is less than 1 million square kilometers, scientists describe it as a "ice -free" state, which accounts for about 7%of the total area of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Today, Yan Bingtao will be banned for 5 years.</p>
<p>Zhao Xintong, 25, was banned for 20 months. Before the ban, he was the world's highest Chinese player.</p>
<p>After the verdict was announced, he issued a "apology statement" on social media in the early morning of Wednesday, saying that he was "shame to China Snooker."</p>
<p>He claimed that he was "dull and blocked" because of his long -standing overseas life, "blindly" imitating others to choose to "pass the time" with gambling. Essence</p>
<p>"I paid a heavy price for the stupid behavior at the time, and spent every day regret." Zhao Xintong said in a statement.</p>
<p>He also said that after the ban, he accepted the psychological consultation assistance provided by the World Professional Billiards and the Snooker Association, saying that he would "return to the stadium with a better image."</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Chinese Snoors players who have quickly risen in recent years have been involved in the fake ball scandal -2018, Chinese players Yu Delu and Cao Yupeng were held for 10 years, 9 months and 9 months, and respectively. After 6 years of ban, the Chinese Taiwan Association also added a lifelong forbidden race to Yu Delu afterwards. At that time, it was accused of the first time the Chinese Taiwan Association was punished for the first time in history.</p>
<p>The Chinese media had previously reported that the Chinese Billiards Association has noticed that the gambling behavior may penetrate into the Chinese player group, and in 2019, the Journey to the British Professional Players led by the famous Snooker Ding Junhui to supervise overseas Chinese professional players overseas Essence</p>
<p>Liang Wenbo, who was involved in the case, was also the Deputy Director of the Association. After the investigation of the case last year, he had been withdrawn the position by the Chinese Taiwan Association.</p>
<p>Some media commented that unlike many sports in China, Snooker professional players are not trained and managed by the official system, but are mostly invested and trained by their respective families. It is said that this makes it difficult for the Chinese Taiwan Association to manage the players uniformly.</p>
<p>Snooker history has been banned by many famous players for suspected corruption, including Quinten Hann, Stephen Lee, and so on.</p>
<p>According to public information and professional website statistics, the cost and cost of Snooker's table ball players are high, but income is much lower than other personal projects such as tennis.</p>
<p>After making a judgment by the World Professional Billiards and the Snooker Association, 10 players could appeal to the penalty decision before June 20."The Association will conduct warning education in the industry and launch a series of measures to carry out anti -gambling counterfeit to the end," said the China Taiwan Association, and said that it would "further increase the management of professional players in Britain."</p>
<p>On the other hand, some experts have pointed out that because China's criminal law has added "organizing the crime of organizing participation in the country (border)" in recent years, it is not ruled out that the players involved in the case may involve criminal crimes.</p>

<h3>Analysis: The punishment measure will play a "strong scarlet" role</h3>
<p>_ ——— BBC Fifth Radio (BBC 5) Snooker reporter Jamie Bladon (<em> _jamie Broughton</em> <em>) </em>) _</p>
<p>The World Professional Billiards and the Snooker Association work hard to investigate this complex case, and they will also be happy with the final punishment decision.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, the organization has shown determination to investigate corruption and has accused anyone who believes in improper behavior.</p>
<p>Snooker has experienced a lot of negative news in recent months, but the punishment of Liang Wenbo and Li Xing's lifelong suspension should be able to play a strong scary role in any player who wants to participate in fake balls.</p>
<p>For many Snooker fans, this case is truly sad why the two largest players in China Yan Bingtao and Zhao Xintong will involve it. Both players are considered potential to become a world champion in the future.</p>
<p>Now people will ask whether Snooker's management agencies can do more work worldwide to educate young players to risk corruption.</p>

<p>Description: The latest import and export data released by the General Administration of Customs of China makes people worry about the growth of China's economic recovery this year. In addition to the continuous increase in exports to Russia, in May, China's exports to ASEAN, the European Union, the United States, Japan, Africa, and Latin America all declined significantly. The soaring inflation, high interest rates and energy prices have all stressed the international demand for the purchase of "Made in China".</p>

<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) The weakening of global market demand has led to a significant decrease in China's exports. Today (June 7), the latest statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China show that according to the US dollar, the import and export of China's imports and exports in May this year was US $ 50119 billion, a year -on -year decrease of 6.2%. Among them, the exports were US $ 283.5 billion, a decrease of 7.5%; imports were US $ 217.69 billion, a decrease of 4.5%; the trade surplus was US $ 65.81 billion, narrowing by 16.1%.</p>
<p>China's exports in April also increased by 8.5 percentage points year -on -year. But a month after a month, a sharp decline. The latest import and export statistics have made another worry about China's economic recovery growth this year.</p>
<p>In May this year, China only <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/中国一季度汽车出口超过日本-俄罗斯成为最大海外市场/a-65668908">export to Russia</a>Continuously increased, an increase of 114.3%, and imports increased by 10.1%year -on -year. In February last year, since Russia invaded Ukraine, China has unswervingly support Russian President Putin, and has never expressed condemnation of Russia's invasion.</p>
<p>In May, China's imports declined for two consecutive months. Although 4.5%decreases less than the expectations of experts, it is very eye -catching. Germany pointed out that this shows that China's domestic market is still weak.</p>
<p>Based on the US dollar, China ’s exports to ASEAN in May fell 15.9%year -on -year, the first time since May 2020.</p>
<p>China's imports from Germany have decreased by 3.8%, and the decline in exports to Germany is even as high as 8.3%. As the second largest trading partner in China, the EU's import and export volume of trade with China is also decreasing. In May, China decreased by 7%to EU exports, and imports dropped slightly by 0.9%.</p>
<p>China's imports and exports to the United States and Japan are also declining. Based on the US dollar, China's exports to the United States in May fell 18%year -on -year and imported from the United States by 9.8%year -on -year. In addition, exports to Africa fell from 49.9%in April to 12.9%, and exports to Latin American decreased from 10.5%to -1.1%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T09-55-00Z/64375290_401.jpg" />The high inflation, the continuous increase in bank interest rates, coupled with the soaring energy prices caused by the Ukrainian war, all pressure on the demand for "Made in China".</p>
<p>China's import and export data in May has been shaded for China's economic growth expectations this year. After China's abandonment of the "Clear Zero" epidemic prevention policy at the end of last year, the economic trend at the beginning of this year showed an optimistic trend. The Beijing side has set up about 5%of the growth goals for this year's economic growth. The economic growth rate in the first quarter of this year achieved 4.5%.</p>
<p>Yan Si, chief representative of the Beijing Representative Office of the German Industry and Commerce Conference(JensHildebrandt)The analysis said: "The latest import and export data indicates that the Chinese economy is still unstable. The local company's expectations of business growth are becoming more and more cautious." He also said: "In view of the current development, the medium -term recovery is more difficult to foresee. "</p>
<p>In April of this year, when China's import and export still realized 7.9%, concerns about the development of China's domestic market have emerged. In April, the [China Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index] announced by the National Bureau of Statistics of China(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/财新pmi上升-中国经济复苏出现不一致信号/a-65790590)(PMI) 49.2%, a decrease of 2.7 percentage points from the previous month. In May, the index further dropped to 48.8, which fell for the third consecutive month and was located in the contraction range for the second consecutive month.</p>
<p>The main reason for China's exports to drop sharply is <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/全球经济增长放缓-广交会交易量未达疫情前水平/a-65553644">weak international market demand</a>Essence The high inflation, the continuous increase in bank interest rates, coupled with the soaring energy prices caused by the Ukrainian war, all pressure on the demand for "Made in China". The total value of China's imports and exports in the first five months of this year was US $ 2.44 trillion, a decrease of 2.8%, of which 6.2%in May in May.</p>
<p>Australian and New Bank analyst Khoongoh said that the latest import and export data is "disappointing again". These data are "concerned about economic growth expectations, and at the same time look forward to more policy support." Some observers speculate that in order to promote economic recovery, the People's Bank of China may be reduced. There are also some opinions that the central bank may soon release the policy news of interest rate cuts.</p>

It aims to stabilize the relationship between the United States and the Gulf Kingdom, which is rich in petroleum resources. The differences in many issues have been deepened -from human rights issues to Iran, to regional safety and oil price issues.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the US State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, in a statement released after the meeting, Blingken talked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on the 6th of this month. Stability, security and prosperity in other regions. " Miller pointed out that the commitment at the meeting also included efforts to achieve peace in Yemen.</p>
<p>Blint also emphasized that the bilateral relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia "strengthened the progress of human rights". He also thanked Saudi Arabia for its support during the retracement of American citizens from the Sudan, which has been warned in the near future, as well as to stop it to stop The diplomatic efforts paid for the battle between the Sudan hostiles.</p>
<p>This is also the second high -level visit to Saudi Arabia in the United States, and Brinkeak will meet with other senior Saudi officials during this three -day visit. It should be pointed out that the White House national security adviser Jack Shalvis has visited Saudi Arabia on May 7 this year.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has recently conflicted with US President Joe Bayeng, and the conflict between the two sides includes the amount of crude oil provided by Saudi Arabia to the global market, Saudi Arabia is willing to cooperate with Russia under the framework of the "OPEC+" alliance, and Saudi Arabia's mediation in China The following agreement with Iran has reached an agreement to ease the relationship. Analysts believe that the purpose of Brinken's trip includes the influence on oil prices with Saudi Arabia, curbing the influence of China and Russia in the region, and hope for the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.</p>
<p>Richard Goldburg, a senior adviser to the Think Tank "Defending Democratic Foundation" headquarters in Washington, said that it may be the most important content of Brincken's visit to stopping Saudi Arabia from establishing a closer relationship with China.</p>
<p>Goldburg pointed out that "Brinken explains why China's interests are not consistent with Saudi Arabia, and why strengthening the relationship between the two parties in a strategic way will hinder its close relationship with the United States."</p>

<p>The relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia was unfavorable in 2019 -at the time, Biden said during the presidential campaign that once he was elected, he would regard Saudi Arabia as a "pariah country". Shortly after taking office in 2021, Biden released an evaluation report from the US intelligence department, claiming that Saudi Crown Prince approved the operation of arrest and killing the Washington Post columnist and reporter Kashuji in 2018.</p>
<p>Biden visited Saudi Arabia in July 2022, but this visit did not help much to ease the tension between the two countries, and Saudi Arabia was increasingly not interested in consistent with the United States' priority in the region.</p>
<p>However, Hussein Ibish, a senior scholar of the National Institute of Arabia in Washington, DC, believes that the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is gradually improving.</p>
<p>Ibish pointed out that "this relationship looks very nervous -it is indeed the same at some levels, but it is stronger from overall."</p>
<p>"Behind the scenes, especially on safety and other similar issues, the relationship between the two parties is stronger than a year ago."</p>

<h1>Reviewing research: Is it worth it in Europe and the United States? Or should I imitate Sweden?</h1>

<p>Description: Should we rely on compulsory measures, or do people consciously voluntarily? A study by the United States and Swedish economists believes that during the first wave of the new crowns, some countries in Europe and the United States have implemented mandatory control measures. Compared with Sweden such as people such as Sweden, the reduced deaths are very limited. The conclusion they concluded is that compulsory control measures are not proportional compared to the cost paid.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65847948/61933623"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T10-22-00Z/61933623_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany) last February, three economists from John Hopkins and the University of Longde, Sweden released a report that reported a comprehensive review of existing research. The conclusion of the report is amazing: Lockdown in Europe and the United States only reduced the mortality by 0.2%during the first wave of epidemic.</p>
<p>However, the report caused great controversy academically. Not only because the three authors are not epidemiology or public health experts, but according to the British "Guardian" report, one -third of their comprehensive review research comes from other economists, and there are no important epidemiology. Studies are included in the evaluation range.</p>
<p>At the same time, how to define lockdown is also the key to affecting the results of the calculation. The Guardian reported that the report at the time of the mandatory commands promoted by any government-academic terms was "non-drug intervention" -s considered a seal-control measure, which included school suspension and shops. It also includes a relatively simple mask obligation.</p>
<p>Professor Adam Kucharski, a professor of epidemiology at the London Health and Tropical Medical College, told the Guardian that such a method is not rigorous. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, deputy hospital of John Hopkins School of Public Health, kept a distance from the report at the time, saying that this was not the scientific research of "Peer-Review", and the method was The "severe problem" is raised.</p>
<p>The three economists released the report of the second edition after the revised second edition in May last year. Their conclusions have changed a lot: the mortality rate decreased in the first wave of epidemic in Europe and the United States was no longer 0.2%, but instead, but instead, it was 3.2%.</p>
<p>Today, the report is published. However, Professor Kurchase told the Guardian that the content of the book was basically the same as May last year, so many criticisms were still established.</p>
<h3>Comparison is a different approach such as Britain and Sweden</h3>
<p>Two of the three authors recently published an article in the British "Daily Telegraph", saying that "choice is never between the control measures and" everything ". If people get information and understand the risks at the time, they will correspond to them correspondingly. Adjusting their behavior-but in many countries, they are not trusted to do so. In addition, our integration analysis reveals the sealing measures to society and <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/新冠危机重创英国经济-11年来首度衰退/a-54539999">economy</a>A series of significant burdens caused by politics. "</p>
<p>The relevant report of "Daily Telegraph" quoted the report stating that in the spring of 2020, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英国公布解封计划-欧洲多国逐步松绑/a-53387791">Britain did not rely on the people to protect themselves consciously like the people, but adopted forced seal control measures</a>This reduced the number of people who died in the new crown due to the new crown. The three authors believe that this number is compared with the huge economic and social costs brought by the control measures-including the long-term impact of suspending classes on disadvantaged students, multiple psychological diseases, and increased deaths caused by other reasons- It is not proportional.</p>
<p>"Daily Telegraph" pays special attention to the [British situation] mentioned in the report [Britain] mentioned in the report.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/欧洲逾20万新冠病亡-英国占五分之一/a-55319347)Looking back on the first control measures in the UK in March 2020. It is reported that the sealing measures at that time were introduced by Professor Neilferguson at the Imperial University of Science and Technology that the number of people died in the UK may be introduced by more than 500,000 people. It is reported that Professor Ferguson's research at the time showed that even if the social distance and home isolation restrictions were adopted, if it was not further closed, it would still cause at least 250,000 people to die. After the introduction of the seal control measures, Professor Ferguson said that in view of the more stringent social distance and other intervention measures, the number of deaths in the UK may be 20,000.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T10-22-00Z/55437570_401.jpg" />How to measure whether the sealing measures are worth it, this is itself a problem</p>
<h3>Different effects that distinguish between compulsory and voluntary measures are difficult</h3>
<p>Professor Ferguson did not reply to the "Daily Telegraph" interview request for the latest version of the report (the latest version includes British data). But when the report was announced last year, he responded: "The exact impact of clarifying a single 'non -drug intervention' measure is still very challenging, especially because of the most disturbing measures for society and the economy ( Closing all non -necessary shops and home order) is usually used with longer measures such as wearing masks, and as the last means. "</p>
<p>Professor Ferguson said: "Because of the accumulation of immunity in the crowd (from infection and vaccination) and the emergence of new new crown variants, analysis becomes more difficult. Because the people between the country (even inside the country) have a big difference in response to the two measures. "</p>
<p>The Guardian also quoted some experts to point out that it is difficult to determine(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/英格兰实施紧急封锁-德国推出更严措施/a-56132186)Instead, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/瑞典的特殊道路效果究竟如何/a-53650735">relying on people to consciously and voluntarily take protection measures, what effect will it produce</a>Essence It is reported that Professor Devisridhar, a public health expert at the University of Edinburgh, said that taking Florida as an example, the governor De Santis has adopted a "free" position, but the security measures taken by the store itself are even better than the British mandatory order. It is also strict, such as children over the age of two must also wear masks. In addition, many local shops still have to stop doing business because employees are sick, or customers are afraid of infection.</p>
<p>Dr. Shaf Schinin of the John Hopkins School of Public Health also said that even countries like Sweden have been seriously affected. He added whether it should be legislative and relied on the people's conscious voluntary, depending on many factors such as local situations. "But what is important is that to ensure that people should not be troubled, it is mistaken for the spring of 2020 we can live as usual. That will be catastrophic."</p>
<p>The latest version of the report was published in Germany's obvious attention from the media.</p>

On May 31, he did not know after the last post of posting in the social media.</p>
<p>Lien Liang, an objection in the Netherlands, said that Qiao Xinxin swimd to the Mekong River near the residence every day. I believe he had an accident after he returned to his residence that day.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang: "It is very likely that as soon as he enters the door, the person who squatting there immediately controls him. It may be instantly holding him down, holding down, it will definitely resist, and it is too late to send any signs of help."</p>
<p>According to Qiao Xinxin's Laos neighbor, Qiao Xinxin was shot and took away by eight people in police uniforms that day, and six of them were suspected of Chinese public security. Some volunteers went to the scene after the incident, and found that Qiao Xinxin's residence left a lot of personal items. There were mottled traces on the wall, which did not rule out the possibility of blood stains.</p>

<p>Qiao Xinxin's real name Yang Zewei, a native of Qidong County, Hunan, has long been engaged in news work for a long time. In March of this year, he initiated the "demolition of the wall" with other overseas democrats(BanGFW)It is believed that China's network fence is isolated from the world, and calls for removing the wall. It is understood that the Hunan authorities have recently put pressure on his family members, asking his family to persuade Qiao Xinxin to delete information and return home soon.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang has called for many times the public security authorities of Qidong County to investigate the whereabouts of their friends. According to him, the authorities have been related to Qiao Xinxin's loss of contact in Laos.</p>
<p>Lin Shengliang: "As soon as I reported the name, they immediately knew. I asked him," Who caught him (Qiao Xinxin)? 'He said, "It's not our case". He is anxious to clarify the relationship. This person was caught by the default. I just called the police station and 110 just now, which confirmed that the case was grabbed by the task force. "</p>

<p>Wang Nan: "China (suspected) has caught people more than once in Thailand. Only well -known democrats have been more than three times. As far as I understand, most of Thailand's economy and export trade depends on China, and the economic and foreign trade in Laos is also the main main maintenance of Laos's economy and foreign trade. It's in China. "</p>

<p>The American Space Force will launch a group of satellite constellations this summer to track Chinese or Russian spacecrafts that may be paralyzed or damaged in the rail objects.</p>
<p>The so -called satellite constellation is a collection of satellites that can work normally, usually a satellite network composed of some satellite ring configured in a certain way.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that according to the US space force and analysts, this satellite network, known as "Silentbarker", will be the first satellite network to supplement ground sensors and low -earth rail satellites. These satellites will be placed about 35,400 kilometers away from the earth, and the rotation speed will be synchronized with the earth.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Space Force said that this ability can send instructions and warnings on the threat of high -value American systems, and will "provide the ability to search, detect and track objects from space, and discover threats in time." The Space Forces cooperate with the National Investigation Agency (NRO) to develop these satellites.</p>
<p>The National Investigation Agency said in a statement that the satellite constellation is scheduled to launch after July, using the ATLASV booster of the joint launch alliance under the Boeing and Lockheed Martin Company. The launch date will be announced on Facebook 30 days in advance.</p>
<p>China and Russia are developing systems that can launch to track and destroy other satellites, which makes the United States more and more worried that the United States launching silent Bark system is to cope with this threat.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-02-00-04-00/000000.png" />The Institute of Public Opinion of Hong Kong canceled the "64th Anniversary Survey Report on June 6, 2023" Audio-LLINK: HTTPS: //www.org/mandarin/Gangtai/Ec1- 06072023104755.html/@@ Stream](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/ec1-06072023104755.html/@@stream)The "June 4th Anniversary Survey Report" with a history of thirty years was suspended before this year was released. The responsible research institutions did not explain the reason, but believed that it was related to the pressure of the Hong Kong government and the Guoan police.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/Xinwen/3-06052023124316.html"><strong> The Hong Kong Government "condemn" the United Nations and the June Association to support June 4th to commemorate the arrested Hong Kong people </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/al-06062023111302.html">"Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" or the first "ban song" in Hong Kong</a></strong></p>
<p>Cai Yaochang, deputy chairman of the former branch federation, pointed out that the June 4th polls are important data reflecting the political views of Hong Kong people. They criticized the Hong Kong government to prohibit the disclosure of polls and the practice was inappropriate. According to the comments, the Hong Kong Government also issued a "willingness to return to Hong Kong" to the court for a ban on the court for the June 4th polls, and believes that the CCP -style clearance operation in Hong Kong is believed to be in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Institute of Public Opinion of Hong Kong originally planned to release the "Sixth Anniversary Survey Report" on Tuesday (June 6), but it was temporarily notified on the webpage on the release date, saying that after the suggestion of the relevant government departments, it was decided to cancel the investigation and release, and and and and offe on the investigation. No more details are disclosed.</p>
<p>The "June 4th" public opinion survey section of the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinion's website shows that the survey began in 1993 and announced it after June 4th. There are 11 issues related to the investigation, including the Beijing authorities and students in the June 4th incident. Rating the right or wrong, whether to support the vindication of June 4th, believe whether the branch will dissolve, and in 1989, China's current human rights status and so on.</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua, the deputy president of the Institute of Public Opinion, said that because it has been moved to the UK, it is unclear the reasons and details of the publicity. However, he said that in the past, the Hong Kong Civil Research had two times. It was pressured by the National Security Police and changed its release arrangements. I believe this time is no exception.</p>
<p>Zhong Jianhua: "I believe this time it should be with the Guoan police. I also tried some polls to be under pressure from the National Security Police before, and changed the arrangement of the release. In fact The way of being careful to ask questions is very neutral. However, the Beijing authorities and the Hong Kong government, in the name of national security, suppress Hong Kong's civil society, and prevent some people in Hong Kong from asking some things that make the CCP sensitive. I do n’t want people to mention it (the Communist Party of China) is just some evil behaviors. It does not allow people to expose its scars. It was not sensitive, and now it becomes sensitive. "</p>
<p>** Cai Yaochang: June 4th polls reflect the important data of Hong Kong people's political opinions.</p>
<p>Cai Yaochang, deputy chairman of the former Branch Federation, said that before the disbanding, the branch association mainly through the relevant polls to understand the views of the Hong Kong people on the June 4th incident, and describing data is an important historical record. It is a pity that the June 4th polls with a history of 30 years cannot be announced. It is believed that the Hong Kong government has never indicated that mourning June 4th is illegal, and public power should not be used to put pressure on polls.</p>
<p>Cai Yaochang: "This public opinion survey can record the views of Hong Kong people on some political issues. In addition to the Federation of the Federation, I want to be important to the entire society. Now the government and the police are obviously not a law enforcement act. In the case of, if it is informal, there is also a threat for groups and people. It is inappropriate to follow a rule of law society, and the government should have a clear and public explanation. "</p>
<p><strong> Sanpu: Hong Kong Government suspected that the CCP -style clearance operation in Hong Kong </strong></p>
<p>Current affairs commentator Sanpu said that combined with the recent Hong Kong government's targeting operations on June 4, and the court's application for prohibiting public or transmitting on any platform, "willing to return to Hong Kong", I believe Beijing is conducting a Chinese -style clearing net in Hong Kong in Hong Kong in Hong Kong. action.</p>
<p>Sangpu: "The overall national security outlook has a cultural security. All the Communist Party of China feels dissatisfied with the Communist Party of China can prohibit it. Because the Communist Party has spent 2020 to the present, it is more than 2 years to clear the democratic faction of Hong Kong in Hong Kong. The investigation reports of the head and face characters, political parties, organizations, and media, and the 64th anniversary of the Hong Kong Civil Research Research could not be made public. The song of "Wish Rongguang Return to Hong Kong" may set off a trend of banning songs. The trend of a clearing net uses cultural security to fully calmly use these things, apply the technologies of autocracy to Hong Kong to the extreme. "</p>
<p>He said that in the past June 4th, Hong Kong people also stood up to mourn at high pressure, which may make the CCP think that Hong Kong people have not fully submit, and thus further catalyzed Beijing to press Hong Kong again.</p>

<p>The Fed's decision -making meeting will also become the focus of the market next week. With the latest data show that the tightening policy of more than a year has begun to play, investors hope that decision -making officials will not increase interest rates for 11 consecutive meetings.</p>

<p>Description: I can't pay the bill, nor is it a substitute for work guarantee or fair remuneration. Work is a contract economy, and it should not be an excuse for employers to exploit employees. Álvaro Bernis</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-07T11-04-02-08-00/05stolzoff-master1050.jpg" />Last month, Warner Bros. David David David David David Zaslav was interviewed on the company's current profit of $ 50 million in the first quarter of 2023. At that time, he said to the business channel of the national broadcasting company that he believed that " "The love of this industry and the love of work", the strike of the American screenwriter union will end.</p>
<p>This strike has entered the sixth week, and the persistence of the screenwriters has made the facts clearer: unfortunately, love cannot pay the bill.</p>
<p>A general belief is that love is the work guarantee, workplace protection or fair compensation <a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/work-wont-love-you-back/">compassion</a><a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/work-wont-love-you-back/">Suitable</a><a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/work-wont-love-you-back/">Replacement</a><a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/work-wont-love-you-back/">Product</a>Especially in the so -called dreaming industries such as writing, cooking, and art, the work of doing it is considered to be a form of repayment.</p>
<p>However, work is a kind of passion or "power generation" confuses the reality of economic contracts. The work is not the assumption of the contract to create conditions for exploitation.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>In fact, creative, mission -driven, and prestigious industries often use their love for their own work to take advantage of their work. According to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21488-001">A Study in 2020</a>If employers think that employees are passionate about their work, they will more frankly accept the practices of harsh treatment, such as expecting them to work overtime but not paying for their rewards, or asking them to do the task that does not belong to their scope of work and lose dignity. This is because the employers have an unsatisfactory assumption: even if they do not pay, their employees will do this job.</p>
<p>This seems to be information from some members of the American screenwriter union. "Writing is a lofty career," said the drama writer and show coordinating Charles Rogers in Los Angeles. "But the current approach of this industry is to make the screenwriters feel that they should be grateful for themselves in this industry." The employer then uses the gratitude mentality of the practitioners, and there are many people who are willing to replace them outside the door. The workers were paid lower than the salary they deserved.</p>
<p>Practitioners are not the concept of work for money to help industries that help others, such as education. "Education is a call," said the mayor of New York City Eric Adams a few weeks ago. "People who are engaged in teaching do not work for money, but because they believe that children in the classroom will succeed."</p>
<p>This sounds respected, but the contract of the New York City Teacher Trade Union has expired in September last year, and Adams has always opposed the salary increase to teachers, allowing salary and inflation to increase simultaneously. Teachers need better remuneration, not to celebrate the torrent of the teacher's thanks for Zhou.</p>
<p>In a papers in 2018, Fabaz Itars, then a book administrator, created a word to describe how the nobles in her eyes covered in the industry. Ether calls this phenomenon "professional awe"(<a href="https://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2018/vocational-awe/"> vocational awe</a>)She defines it as a belief: as a workplace, the library itself is a noble place, so it is considered to be unable to criticize. According to her, employees are more vulnerable to exploitation in a workplace that everyone thinks of noble work. "In the face of the macroelers of culture and freedom, the advocating sufficient lunch time gives people a lot of care," she wrote.</p>
<p>Ether has known himself as a book administrator since his teens. When she studied a library degree, the professors liked poetically calling as a book administrator as a mission and describing the role of the library as the last real democratic agency.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>But in front of the reference book consultation desk, she saw how the idealism of this industry covered her low salary. The head of the first job obtained by Ether after getting a library's degree told her, "No one is a book administrator to earn basic living wages." industry.</p>
<p>During the popularity of the new crown virus, professional awe has been fully displayed. People say to educators that they are engaged in sacred work, but they also tell them that they can only rely on limited resources. Medical staff are considered indispensable, but they often do not get paid or protection measures that are consistent with the serious danger facing at work. In the admirable industry, the nobles in everyone's eyes cover up the harsh working conditions, just like applying frosting cakes with burnt cakes.</p>
<p>Although occupational awe is common in the industry that Jide is good, it also exists in the areas that people rely on brand power to transfer people's real experience of practical experience in employees. Taking the zoo administrator as an example, according to Indeed data, the occupation [average salary] of this occupation(https://www.indeed.com/career/zookeeper/salaries)It is $ 16.51 per hour. Although the management of zoo is romantic (with the canned animals all day!), This kind of work is generally working for a long time, hard work, and cleaning the feces.</p>
<p>Scholars of research organizations Jeffrey Thompson and Stuart Bondon are in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27749305">one research</a>It was found that in response to the duty of the mission to become a zoo administrator. "On the one hand, it has promoted occupational identity, excellent significance, and occupational importance," they wrote, which officers that "on the other hand," on the other hand, the rigid responsibility, personal sacrifice and high vigilance. " The conclusions they conclude that low wages, poor benefits, and harsh working conditions are often sacrifices to do their favorite jobs.</p>
<p>As I am <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704142/the-good-enough-job-by-simone-stolzoff/">New Book</a>As described in China, this sense of responsibility and individual sacrifice may not only cause practitioners to mix out the output with their self -worth, but also may have a chilling effect on their willingness to expose their wrong behavior. When you are engaged in a great industry and have a job that makes you feel lucky, you are afraid that losing will make it more difficult for you to stand up and talk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the workers were recognizing their collective power. Practitioners from all walks of life across the country have organized and are striving for better working conditions.</p>
<p>advertiseThey got a lot of support. According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx">Gallop</a>Last year's public opinion survey, 71%of Americans support unions, which was the highest in Gallop's record since 1965.</p>
<p>As Eutal said to me, "Workers see that unless they unite to fight, they will be squeezed out and exhausted." As the first step, employers need to realize Love.</p>

<p>Workers are dissatisfied with the factory's approach to gather at the factory gate to confront the manager.

<p>Some netizens commented behind the video that Jiaxin Factory was a good factory that is difficult to enter.</p>
<p>Some netizens left a message saying that a few days ago, a factory next to Wuli Industrial Zone was also the same. The factory had to dissolve, but called the employee to write a resignation, and the salary was only 70 %. Some netizens left a message and said that recently, several Jinjiang factories have disbanded. Why?</p>
<p>It should be asked why!</p>
<p>Obviously it is a factory, but in order to evade the payment of the labor contract compensation, the factory dares to ask the workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter illegally. why?</p>
<p>As early as 2012, the Jiaxin Factory established the "CPC Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd. <a href="http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/xxgk/gsgg/201007/t20100721_919497.htm">Company Branch Committee</a>". Since there are party branches, there should be factory unions. The illegal acts of the factory occur under the eyelids of the party branch and union. So where is the union? And when the workers have already moved their rights to defend their rights, Why can't I see the shadow of the union?</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, that is, Jiaxin Factory suddenly announced the suspension of business and asked the workers to sign the voluntary leaving letter 6 weeks before, China Industry Network had published an article <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions continue to explore how to better use collective consultations to safeguard the rights and interests of employees and promote the development of the enterprise.</p>
<p>We have reason to doubt that the party branch and trade union of Jiaxin Factory is well -known, and has not played any role in ensuring the right of the workers in the factory. China Industry.com reports that the continuous exploration of collective negotiations by the Federation of Trade Unions of the Jinjiang City is only in order to complete the propaganda tasks and publish the so -called positive energy reported by the unions reported by the unions in various places.</p>
<p>In reality, truly meaningful collective negotiations and collective negotiations have never entered any enterprise. Otherwise, Jiaxin, a 27 -year -old factory, and was a good factory that was difficult to enter in the minds of workers. What about this unscrupulous employer?</p>
<p>With these issues, I tried to find the local unions of Jinjiang there, and tried to persuade the union to enter the scene of the labor and management confrontation, representing the workers negotiating negotiation with the factory. The process can be described as twists and turns.</p>
<p>It turned out that in Fujian, who had been the governor of Xi Jinping, to this day, the village staff knew that the labor and management confrontation had occurred but was unwilling to go to the scene to understand the situation. The so -called grid work is even more terrible. If the labor and capital confrontation is not assigned to the lattice of the union staff, the trade union cannot go over to the scene to represent the workers and the enterprise.</p>
<p>As early as 4 years ago, in 2019, the former General Secretary of Fujian Governor <a href="https://news.sina.cn/gn/2019-07-18/detail-ihytcerm4577324.d.html">Xi Jinping once scolded</a>Full of food all day long, lazy and inaction.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you let me go to Yang Guan Dao, but I only love Dulin Bridge. 4 years ago, the current lazy officials actually made a layer of "cocoon" for themselves, and used "making cocoons self -binding".</p>
<p>What's more, in the Jinjiang River, there are still regulations at the township level, and it is not possible to provide the phone number of the union chairman to the people looking for the town union. In this way, I do n’t know if some of the preparation leaders, including the chairman of the union, can hide behind those who are likely to answer calls who are likely to be unliked. What about the day, the muddy day "?</p>
<p>On February 11, this year, that is, the Jiaxin Factory violated the law and required workers to sign the voluntary resignation letter 10 weeks before, China Industry Network once reported <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/article/7210329932277383692/?channel=&amp;source=search_tab">report</a>It is said that the Fujian Quanzhou Trade Union deployed the special work deployment of the General President and the Provincial General Manager of the Provincial General Manager, and the municipal and county trade unions quickly acted to establish special classes, formulated plans, and focused on political leadership. Licensed up and down and advance steadily.</p>
<p>However, in this Jiaxin closure factory incident, the special classes, solutions, linkages, and promotion of the bridgehead of Jinjiang Trade Union could not be found at all.</p>
<p>According to China Industry.com, members of the Federation of Union of Quanzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are linked to 1 to 2 county -level unions and 2 to 3 grass -roots unions, which are normalized.</p>
<p>So, as a large factory, which member of the Federation of the Federation of Quanzhou City is connected and communicated with normal communication?It seems that the people who may be responsible for the release of China Industry.com are precisely some people who are "mediocre and peaceful stalls, peaceful peace, and mixed days." These people only care about publication, and do not care about the lack of missing missions in the living incidents such as Jiaxinguan Plant. They do not care whether the exaggerated achievements have happened in the reports issued.</p>
<p>Another report that CICC has also issued on March 2 this year, the title is "[<a href="http://acftu.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0302/c67502-32634812.html">Fujian Jinjiang Federation of Trade Unions Construction Models full of effects to make the county -level trade union full of vitality</a>"It reported that the Jinjiang Trade Union focused on the" top five "goals with strong political leadership, strong organizational functions, strong service positions, strong institutional mechanisms, and strong functions. , Strive to consolidate the staff and the masses at the grassroots level, actively perform their duties, and take their responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, in reality, during the closing factory of the Jiaxin Factory, illegal violations of the rights and interests of the workers, but the local union staff did not want to go out to the scene to represent the workers, but wait for the workers to come to the door. Do.</p>
<p>In other words, the "five top five" mentioned in China Industry.com, as well as focusing on the grass -roots level, condensing employees and masses at the grassroots level, actively performing their duties, and being courageous. It has not happened, and even has always been a pile of empty slogans that use the "Xuanke of the Make -ups, and have no intention".</p>
<p>In this report, CICC has also piled up a series of new terms, such as: Jinjiang Trade Union innovative "hierarchical fixed, classified management" model, and step by step to grasp the demonstration to form a "cultivation, improvement, demonstration" enterprise with gradual step -by -step enterprises. The construction mechanism of the union, and so on, the clouds of Yunshan are dazzling.</p>
<p>The good situation of enterprises ".</p>
<p>The report also specifically mentioned a bunch of unknown effects, including: creating a working base for the integration of employees in the Jinjiang Economic Development Zone, building a work pattern of "union standing, departmental construction, and sharing of employees", integrating trade unions, justice, mediation mediation For the forces, the service structure of "one center, one stop, two points, two courts, and three rooms" is formed to achieve seamless links of conflict adjustment, labor arbitration, and judicial ruling to resolve the "full response" of contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking at these nouns and numbers, I thought of the two scammers tailors in the Andersen fairy tale "Emperor's New Clothing".</p>
<p>For scammers, as long as the money is coming, as for the emperor's buttocks on the street, it is his own business.</p>
<p>The fantastic achievements of the unions reported by China Industry Network, whether the leaders and the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of China can understand, I don't know anyway, I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, you only need to illegally ask workers to sign a voluntary resignation letter with the Jialin Customs Factory, but the union has nothing to do with this two things, and put these two things together. Those all day The true face of the scammers who are busy making new clothes, there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Please listen to me about illegal infringement of workers' rights and interests in Fujian Jinjiang Jiaxin Light Industry Development Co., Ltd., and look for the talks of the union. After listening, tell me how you feel.</p>

The picture shows the data chart of Qingdao Port in China <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/ec2-06072023111114.html/@@stream">ADIO-Link: https: //www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibao/jingmao/ec2-0607202311114.html/@@stream</a>As the world's second largest economy, China ’s latest May import and export data shows that the denomination of RMB has increased slightly, but converted to the US dollar by 7.5%year -on -year. Comments pointed out that the data reflects China's macro -regulation inadequate capacity to turn the tide, and the sharp depreciation of the yuan cannot stimulate the export. It is believed that it will crack down on China's annual economic growth performance.</p>
<p>[<strong> China's first -tier cities are expected to relax the shrinking real estate and rental market in Shanghai.(https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/gt2-06072023053052.html)</strong><em> <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/jingmao/jw2-06062023132743.html">Scholars: China ’s unemployment statistics, distortion employment situation is severe</a></em>*</p>
<p>The China Customs General Administration announced the latest import and export data on Wednesday (June 7). The import and export in May was 3.45 trillion yuan in RMB, an increase of 0.5%year -on -year. However, the price of the US dollar was turned into 7.5%year -on -year, and the atrophy was much higher than the market expectations of 0.4%. It ended the trend of exports for two consecutive months since March of this year. The imports also decreased by 4.5%, and the trade surplus was US $ 65.81 billion, a year -on -year narrowing of 16.1%.</p>
<p>According to the export performance in the first five months of this year, the total value of import and export was 1.677 trillion yuan, an increase of 4.7%year -on -year. However, according to the US dollar, the total import and export value of the first five months was US $ 2.44 trillion, a decrease of 2.8%, and the import decline was larger, reaching 6.7%; the trade surplus was 359.48 billion US dollars, an increase of 27.8%.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, economists believe that poor export performance is related to the weak demand for Chinese goods. At the same time, the demand for re -exports made by imported parts in Chinese manufacturing is also poor, and import performance is not good.</p>
<p><strong> Comment: The era of China's years of dependence on devaluation and exchange of foreign exchange is over </strong></p>
<p>The Economist Division said that the latest data shows that China has lost the status of the world's factories, macro -regulation is not capable of turning the tide, and even the RMB depreciated sharply, and it cannot stimulate the exports. It is believed that it will crack down on China's economic growth performance throughout the year.</p>
<p>Commander: "In the past few decades, China has rely on devaluation to obtain trade dividends. Even if the renminbi has accelerated the depreciation, China's import and export data still cannot go up. This is probably the biggest problem that the Chinese government has encountered now. Let the renminbi depreciate, the more this way to accelerate the withdrawal from the United States. It is by no means a good signal. "</p>
<p><strong> Comments: Preparation for China to be decoupled with Western countries </strong></p>
<p>Data show that from January to May of this year, China's total value of imports and exports to Taiwan fell the largest, decreased by about 20 % year -on -year. China's import and export data of New Zealand, Japan and the United States also fell. Increased by 51%, of which export growth increased sharply by nearly 90%year -on -year.</p>
<p>The commander believes that while the outside world pays attention to the poor import and export performance, it is also important to pay attention to the changes in the import and export data of China and other regions and countries, showing that China is actively decoupled with Western countries.</p>
<p>Commander: "If China has a strategic and irreversible friction with the United States, China must completely close the way to retreat for its own country. From the perspective of trade flow, China is actually accelerating its main way to take it mainly to mainly take it mainly to focus on it. The target of trade has gradually shifted from Europe and the United States to Russia, as well as the Central Asian and Shanghai Cooperation Organizations, and countries in the Belt and Road Initiative. Turning in this direction shows that China ’s intended plans to be decoupled with the West."</p>
<p>Commander said that although China is willing to reduce its dependence on Western countries in terms of import and export trade, most markets are settled by the US dollar as a settlement currency, and it is not necessary for China to reduce the US dollar regulations.</p>

<p>Description: The Silicon Valley Venture Corporation plans to be split into three independent partners. China and India's business will adopt new brands, and European and American business will retain the original name. Several Sequoia executives said the company's global business management has become "more and more complicated." Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg's management partner of Sequoia Capital Rolov Bota said the cost of running concentrated functions "is not worth it."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/cnnytimes/2023-06-07T11-39-28-08-00/06sequoia-master1050.jpg" />As China and the United States have increased their tensions on investment and obtaining advanced technologies, Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley's most famous venture capital companies, has split itself and stripped Chinese subsidiaries into an independent company.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://twitter.com/sequoia/status/1666029996455112704?s=61&amp;t=mvshv-2GAX9rupGX_CMqug">announced on Tuesday</a>It plans to split into three independent partners, and its business in China and India will adopt new brands, and the name of Sequoia will be retained in companies in the United States and Europe. Sequoia Capital Management Partner Rolov Bota, Shen Nanpeng, President of China, and the head of Indian business, Sha Ellendra Singh, said in a statement that the company's global business management has become "increasing complex".</p>
<p>In an interview, Bota said that Sequoia has been evaluating whether the centralized model has been reasonable for many years. He said that this problem has reached an unsolvable level in the past few months. "We know very well that the cost of putting all these together and the background is not worth it."</p>
<p>"We are increasingly dealing with the conflict of investment portfolio cross -real -body, because the founders really have global ambitions now," Bota said. "The confusion of the brand begins to disturb everyone."</p>

<p>Sequoia's Chinese business will be named Sequoia(Hongshan)Essence Sequoia's business in India and Southeast Asia will be named Peak XV Partners.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital has more than $ 53 billion in assets in the United States and Europe, $ 56 billion in China, and US $ 9 billion in India and Southeast Asia. According to a person who understands the fund's performance, in the past five years, the company's business in the United States and Europe has created a return of more than $ 30 billion.</p>
<p>Since entering China in 2005, Sequoia Capital has played an important role in the rapid and rich rise of Chinese technology giants. Its eye -catching investment includes the owner of the video application TIKTOK's byte beating; the Ant Group of Financial Technology Corporation; and SHEIN, a fast fashion retailer. The company has invested in more than 1,000 companies in China, including emerging technology fields such as electric vehicles and biotechnology.</p>
<p>Shen Nanpeng, president of Sequoia Capital China, is a member of the board of directors. In TIKTOK because of the so -called relationship with the Chinese government, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/03/23/technology/tiktok-hearing-congress?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">Facing the dissatisfaction of American legislators</a>At the same time, this popular application executives are facing the question of whether Beijing monitoring Americans on behalf of Beijing, and the byte beating has received close attention.</p>
<p>Recently, venture capital investors have become more and more cautious about investing in China: Study data from the company Pitchbook shows that the transaction amount last year fell by half to about $ 69 billion, the lowest level in six years. Not all of them are related to the situation of geopolitical tensions. Until the end of last year, the Chinese economy slowly slowed down under the strict "clear zero" limit.</p>
<p>However, with the dominance of the United States and China for the economic leadership, doing business in China has become more complicated, especially in sensitive industries such as technology.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>The United States has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/us-china-investing-tech-biden.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">considering restricting investment in China</a>This has aroused strong opposition from some major investors, and also caused some hesitation of Bayeng government officials. They are worried that too wide measures may lead to unexpected consequences. While drafting these possible restrictions, after a period of tension, the US government is also seeking the relief of the relationship between the two parties.</p>
<p>Last week, at the hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee, Paul Rosen, assistant minister of the Ministry of Finance, who was responsible for investing in security, said that the government is "trying to develop a narrow and concentrated plan" to limit Investment of sensitive technology, such as advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20220706/us-china-export-controls/">prohibited domestic companies from selling certain technologies directly to China</a>And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/business/foreign-investment-united-states.html">monitor Chinese companies' investment in the United States</a>Whether there is security risk.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has recently aimed at the consulting company that is connected with foreign countries, which <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20230515/china-anti-espionage-law/">caused the vigilance of Western executives</a>Essence These companies help foreign companies to evaluate investment and play a particularly important role in China, because it is difficult to get reliable information for companies who want to invest in China.</p>

The meeting passed the "Notice of May 16" that launched the Cultural Revolution, and "knocked down" Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, and Yang Shangkun who used the "flag of flags" to launch the Cultural Revolution. Soon, the first wave of storms in response to the Cultural Revolution appeared in the society. The start date of this wave of storms was May 29, 1966, and it was also a week. On that night, a group of middle school students held a secret party in the Yuanmingyuan relics, established an organization named Red Guards, and affected the historical process.</p>
<p>However, before telling the birth of the Red Guards, we must first look at the social background that it can be born. In the middle of the 1960s, what kind of education was in what kind of campus environment of middle school students at that time?</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that at the time of the middle school campus, there were extremely strong personal worship of Mao Zedong. The degree of worship can be said to be unimaginable today's middle school students. Although the Chinese authorities are currently promoting personal worship of Xi Jinping, so far this worship has not yet reached the extent of Mao worship at that time -of course, it may be uncertain in the future. Xu Youyu, a historian of the Cultural Revolution, tells the story of a former Red Guards that W Red Guards known as a former Red Guard in his monograph "The Form and Evolution of the Red Guards". In 1966, W was nineteen years old, and he was a senior high school student. He told Xu Youyu: "During the Cultural Revolution, I suddenly thought that since Chairman Mao had to eat and sleep like us, did he also urinate like ordinary people? ? I think he should, but I dare not think that our great leaders do such a low -level thing. I firmly deny that he will use different ways to us. I dare not think about how he solves this problem, and dare not tell others others My doubt. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-40-09-04-00/000002.png" />On August 1, 1966, after Chinese leader Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution and re -seizing power, he met with revolutionary teachers and students from the country in Beijing.(Associated Press information picture)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-06072023094915.html/ap19270162449110.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-40-09-04-00/000003.png" /></a>This sounds very ridiculous, because Mao Zedong is also an individual. Of course, he also needs to eat, drink, and sleep. So, what does this think Mao Zedong like this? It can be said that in his mind, Mao Zedong was not a "person", but a god, at least not an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Xu Youyu's book also quoted the idea of star Liu Xiaoqing in that year. In describing that idea, Liu Xiaoqing said: "I admire Chairman Mao like this. Such love, pure feelings can be said to have no one -star impurities. I gradually grew up understanding personnel. When the child's secret, the first thing I thought of in the vibration of the five thunder was: "Is this the same?" Of course, I will immediately dispel my desecration of my deep love leaders. "</p>
<p>From this point of view, Liu Xiaoqing did not dare to imagine that Mao Zedong would perform sexual behavior like Yun Yun's sentient beings. He thought that thinking about it was also a blasphemy for Mao Zedong. Such logic, like the wentest mentioned above, dare not imagine that Mao Zedong will eat and go to the toilet, all from similar psychology. At that time, countless middle school students, like Liu Xiaoqing and W, did not dare to imagine that Mao Zedong would also conduct the same physiological activities as the general public.</p>
<p><strong> Second, crazy hatred education </strong></p>
<p>In fact, among the cults that appear in human history, there will be not only objects that let believers love and worship, but also the objects that let believers hate. On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong worship was the same. Middle school students are not only educated to worship Mao Zedong as a leader, worship as gods without ordinary human physiological activities, but also asks to hate many countries that they have never been to, such as the so -called "US Emperor" and "Su Xiu". That is the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Xu Youyu described the international view of the Red Guards at the time in his works, saying: "In the minds of the Red Guards, the United States is the most vicious external enemy in China. With North Korea as a springboard and attempting to invade China, when it was beaten, it ignited warfire in Vietnam, and the purpose was to attack China. In this generation of Chinese youths, not many people knew that the Korean War was because of the Kim Il Sungcheng because of the Kim Il Sungcheng The Northern North Korean regular army invaded the South, and not many people knew that the UN Security Council passed a resolution to authorize the United Nations Army to assist South Korea to repel armed offense. Of course Vietnam's war is the aggression against the United States in North Vietnam. "Cama's article also pointed out that this kind of absurd thing is increasingly before the Cultural Revolution. (See Heart: Interview with the "Cultural Revolution" reflection of Shiyang Director Kama ", which is published in" China Digest "additional issue 375)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-40-09-04-00/000004.png" />On August 10, 1966, the young woman who only knew Zhou Zhou inspired the morale of other Red Guards in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China officially launched the Cultural Revolution on May 16, 1966.(Associated Press information picture)<a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-06072023094915.html/ap16137133323926.jpg"> <img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-40-09-04-00/000005.png" /></a>In addition to the United States, another middle school student was educated to ask for hatred is the Soviet Union -in fact, in the political context of the Red China at that time, the Soviet Union was not even worthy of being called "the Soviet Union", but was called "Su Xiu" is also the "Soviet amendmentism" that has been regarded as betrayal of the international communist movement. Xu Youyu's book also described the method of hatred education for the Soviet Union at the time, mentioning that this narrative and touting of China at that time were combined. Xu Youyu's book said: "The depiction of Chinese reality is also a myth. China is said to be the most advanced and best country in the world. Our leaders are loved by the people of all countries in the world, and our army is unparalleled in the world. After the doctrine, the center of the World Revolution moved to Beijing, which is a historical trend: Marx, Engels once hoped that Britain, France, and Germany first broke out the proletarian revolution. After the death, due to the betrayal of Khrushchev, the revolutionary center moved to the east, defeating all emperors, repairing, and anti -anti -people. A system that China has never officially established!), The overturned landlords, rich farmers, capitalists, Kuomintang, and right and other bad elements, hiding in the dark corner to plan to change the conspiracy. Once they succeed, they will be thousands of thousands Millions of people landed. Their method is to make every effort to find the party's agents and launching the water to launch. Therefore, young people are the key to whether the party and the country change color and the success of the world revolution. "</p>
<p>Let's analyze such a narrative. First of all, in this narrative, China is said to be the most advanced and beautiful country in the world. Mao Zedong is said to be a character that has been loved by the world, just like the "envious of the world in the world today's Korean political propaganda The tone of us "is the same. Secondly, Beijing was said to be the center of the World Revolution, and the Soviet Union was said to be the traitor of this revolution. Moreover, not only the Soviet Union is a traitor. There are still many so -called "class enemies" in the Red China that has been steadily established in the Red China that has long been established in the Communist Party. Pull the youth into the water. " The conclusion of this narrative is that these people "once successful, they will land on the ground", "youth is the key to whether the party and the country can change color and whether the world revolution can succeed." : "The Form and Evolution of the Mental Quality of the Red Guards", Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1999.)</p>
<p><strong> 3. The Logic of Extreme Political narrative with a high unity of the whole society </strong></p>
<p>Here, it is not difficult to see that the narrative method in this set of education is very similar to the logic used in the May 16th Notice. If you still remember what I said before, there was a word in the "May 16th Notice" violently criticized the "February Outline" launched by Peng Zhen under the leadership of Peng Zhen, saying:</p>
<p>"In short, this outline is to oppose the socialist revolution to the end, oppose the cultural revolution line of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, combat the proletarian left, shelter the bourgeois right, and prepare for public opinion for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. The reflection of thought in the party is a downright revisionism. Struggling to fight with this amendment line is definitely not a trivial matter, but the fate of our party and the country, the future of our party and the country, the party and our party and our party and the country The future of the country is also a top priority that is related to the World Revolution. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-40-09-04-00/000006.png" />On September 14, 1966, the Red Guards Movement reached a climax. Chinese youths raised their hair quotes, carried the portrait of Marx, and held a demonstration demonstration.(Associated Press information picture)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/zonghengdalishi/wenge/hist-06072023094915.html/ap16137131579578-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-40-09-04-00/000007.png" /></a>I once said in the previous content that the "May 16th Notice" has increased the significance of the struggle between Peng Zhen and the February Outline to the degree of unsuccessful, and use "a top priority related to the World Revolution". Describe, it can even be said that it has been lifted to a height of "saving the earth". If you simply look at such a paragraph, people who lack the experience of life in that era may feel incredible, thinking that this is completely a complete mad talk and persecution delusion. In fact, such a crazy logic is not only unique to the May 16th Notice. It can be said that at that time, the documents launched by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were looking at the world with such a crazy logic. Education in school was also using such a crazy logic to look at the world. Publicity is still looking at the world with such a crazy logic. Such political propaganda is overwhelming, covering all over the CCP's governance, depicting the sensational conspiracy and being said to be a grand cause that saves the world with a crazy and exaggerated tone. Such dense, unified, and long -term brainwashing has become part of people's study, work, and life. To this day, we can still see the words of daily life, and some Cultural Revolution will pop up from time to time, showing the depth of this brainwashing. For middle school students who are relatively unstable in the world view, how much such brainwashing will be "magic", it is conceivable.Thank you everyone. This is here this week, we see you next week.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-44-00-04-00/000000.png" />On October 29, 2019, during the China Public Safety Expo held in Shenzhen, China, people gathered at the Dahua Science and Technology Board. According to a U.S. monitoring research company, Dahua's artificial intelligence camera is designed to suppress protests. Andy Wong/Associated Press</p>
<p>A Chinese company that provides camera surveillance technology and sanctioned by the Western governments has launched products. Combined with artificial intelligence technology, it can automatically notify the authorities when someone expands banners.</p>
<p>The first report, pointing out that the American information monitoring and research company IVPM, which has the product of Dahua Technology, said that the purpose of the artificial intelligence technology contained in the camera produced by Dahua Technology Co., Ltd. is obviously to make the protesters sound.</p>
<p>After IPVM made a request for comment on Dahua Technology, Dahua immediately deleted the context of "Jinn" in the product system. However, it can be seen in the versions of the existing Dahua Technology website that the company explained that the use of this technology is "social security" and "social governance" -These are common vocabulary that the Chinese authorities will monitor and arrest them rationally.</p>
<p>During the past few years during the new crown epidemic, this artificial intelligence technology and government tracking technology have been widely adopted in China, and this system of Dahua Technology is only one of the cases of rapid growth of this kind of AI technology.</p>
<p>Critics said that a large number of police in the police in China has significantly increased the ability of authorities to restrict social freedom, control the people, and suppress specific groups.</p>
<p><strong> "</strong> <strong> system will send a warning message </strong> <strong>" </strong></p>
<p>According to _ <a href="https://perma.cc/KRU6-DBBP?type=image">Dahua website access page</a>_, The artificial intelligence system was launched in 2021 and was put into use in May 2023.</p>
<p>The launch time of this system is exactly in line with the time point of the large -scale investment geographic information system throughout China in 2020.</p>
<p>Charles Rollet, IPVM's IPVM company, said that the public security sector in the regions will use this Dahua artificial intelligence system, but Dahua Technology is the main force of Chinese police equipment.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-44-00-04-00/000001.png" />On May 29, 2019, Dahua surveillance camera installed on the Greater Technology Office of Hangzhou Dahua, China.(Photo source: Agence France -Presse)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/diaocha-baodao/mz-06062023121301.html/7b9f412a-9aef-4df8-83b7-be539093cc43.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-44-00-04-00/000002.png" /></a>He said: "The development of banner alarm caters caters to the Chinese market: large government departments are usually police." "This system is intended to be used by the police or a certain form of urban authorities ... In short, unless you, unless you, you, unless you It is to track protests, otherwise it will be unreasonable to automatically track them (protest banner). "</p>
<p>In recent years, the most well-known protesting operation in China-the white paper movement that protests China's new crown and clear policy- _ <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/ccp-bridgeman-10142022161722.html">is a man who starts the protest banner on the overpass</a>_ - This shows that the technology may be related to the police (although the police use a banner tracking technology in this specific case).</p>

Earlier, Dahua Technology's internal documents showed that the company provided facial recognition of artificial intelligence technology to track Uyghur people, which caused sanctions in Western countries. Dahua Technology denies specific ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Dahua's official website also posted a video shot in 2020 to demonstrate its artificial intelligence system to shoot the moral banner process, but the video was later deleted. The video commentary said, "If the person holding a banner is monitored within the scope of the camera, and the behavior continues for a long time, the system will send an alert to the police."</p>
<p>Dahua Technology did not respond to the requirements of Radio Free Asia for comments.</p>
<p><strong> Police technology equipment development wave </strong></p>
<p>Banner development monitoring technology is the continuation of the Chinese police exploring the "development of artificial intelligence and how the technology is put into use", and IPVM's Rules said.</p>
<p>China has collected a large number of people's data for a long time, and the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence technology provides the authorities with a new way to collect intelligence.</p>
<p>IPVM also got a copy last month(https://s.ipvm.com/uploads/embedded_file/80c1a225f27aef8c9c1966e8d63e7eb5f556530e267ffe0acf7618fb5d592c9a/133d7b88-dba9-4137-8efa-0772938d2e19.pdf)_, Show an attempt to show the Chinese authorities intending to use the large -scale data collected.</p>
<p>The purchase invitation notice description: "Traditional police work needs to be transformed into digital, intelligent, convenient, and simple online operation." This notice also said, "Effectively managing police operation models, making it the maximum effectiveness of the public security technology. solved problem."The project aims to create an automatic alarm system and notify the police to the police. Songjiang District is a densely populated suburbs, including a large number of scholars and college students.</p>
<p>The "target group" seeking automatic tracking includes Uighurs; foreigners with illegal residence; key universities and staff; foreign reporters in China; foreigners who have been to Xinjiang or other similar regions; those who accept new crown vaccines; Suspects, sex workers and drug trafficking; and families with unusual electricity consumption.</p>
<p>According to the later removal notice, the Songjiang Public Security Bureau handed over the project to Shanghai Jiyi Technology Development Company, which obviously specialized in contracting government contracts.</p>
<p>Shanghai Jiyi Technology Development Company did not respond to the request of this station.</p>
<p>Like Dahua Technology Company, the Songjiang District Public Security Bureau removed the bidding announcement after the IPVM announced the investigation report in May, and Radio Free Asia could not contact the project manager listed in the notice to seek comments.</p>
<p><strong> "</strong> <strong> Big Brother </strong> <strong>" </strong> <strong> limit </strong></p>
<p>Wang Songlian, a human rights observation of international human rights organizations headquartered in New York, said that the 26 categories of "target groups" listed in the Shanghai project are the "key persons" identified by the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Wang Songlian told Radio Free Asia that "petitioners, former subjects, social psychological disabilities, etc. have been subject to the police" and technical monitoring.</p>

<p>The parameters they use -tracking the expansion of the banner or the increase in the power consumption of the household (in the bidding project of the Shanghai Public Security) -often the method of pushing, from those behaviors that may be prohibited. Find out -of -the -art behavior to be suppressed by the authorities, such as protests or mining to find cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>"This reminds me of the era when China began to use a large number of technical monitoring methods in 2016 and 2017." Kane said: "They will track those who suddenly start smoking or drink, or they suddenly buy people who can make tent materials.</p>
<p>"And there is no specific reason for such tracking. They only say that this kind of behavior is suspicious. It sounds like it is unusual as if they choose a few behaviors at will," he said.</p>
<p>"It seems that the authorities are reversed. First, there is a result, so I can put it for a reason."</p>
<p><strong> Discrimination and danger </strong></p>
<p>But these police measures have a real impact on the targeted ethnic groups.</p>
<p>In particular, the Chinese official large -scale monitoring of the Uighurs' behaviors is the key factor that enables the official to persecute the Uyghur people, and Wang Songlian, the human rights observation organization.</p>
<p>"No matter where the Uyghur people go to China, they will be subject to discrimination and targeted law enforcement by local public security," Wang Songlian said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-44-00-04-00/000007.png" />On July 15, 2021, tourists were taking pictures near Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and a policeman was watching.(Photo source: ng Han Guan/Associated Press)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/ytbdzhuantixilie/diaocha-baodao/mz-06062023121301.html/6557ebcf-43b4-4978-821d-4c909adae85e.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T11-44-00-04-00/000008.png" /></a>"This means that they will often be injured -often cannot find places to settle, and hotels cannot be found. Usually, when they take a train, they will be investigated and questioned."</p>
<p>According to media agencies in China Digital Age(https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2023/05/cdt-report-cloud-cover-police-geographic-information-system-procurement-across-china-2005-2022/)_, The boom of the Chinese police betting resources to buy the tracking system first was first seen in 2017, followed by 2020, and rose during the new crown epidemic.</p>
<p>The report pointed out that "some contracted contracts are exactly the government's purchase of other monitoring systems specially targeted at Uighurs," "" In addition, there are quite dense monitoring system procurement in many Uighurs or other ethnic minorities. "</p>
<p>Wang Songlian pointed out that what is worrying is that "these (artificial intelligence monitoring) systems, the different application methods have enabled the Chinese authorities to infringe human rights in different ways."</p>
<p>"When these technologies are so cheap and can be widely used, in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative, in view of the Chinese government's influence of the Chinese government, they have spread rapidly and adversely affect global human rights," she said.</p>
<p>Ruo Le agreed to this. He said, "I can imagine that such monitoring and law enforcement happened in other countries." "I think the biggest risk is that this has given a precedent for other countries and how to apply these technologies to other countries. Do you understand? "</p>

<h1>The EU introduced counter -tooling tools to say "no"</h1>

<p>Description: In order to prevent China such as economic coercion and intervene in the political decision -making of EU member states, the European Union is about to launch counter -control tools. Previously, Lithuania agreed to set up a representative office in the country because Lithuania agreed to the establishment of a representative office in the country, and Beijing had imposed large -scale economic sanctions on Lithuania.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/overlay/image/article/65849853/61306037"> <img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T11-53-00Z/61306037_303.jpg" /></a>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In the future, if any country interfere with the political decision -making of the European Union and its member states, it will be sanctioned by the EU. On Tuesday, the representatives of the EU Parliament and the government representatives of the member states reached a consensus on a new sanction tool. In the future, if the third country tries to interfere with the political decision of the EU or its member states with improper economic sanctions, the EU will be able to counter the country's improving punitive tariffs.</p>
<p>Other response methods also include restricting the country's direct investment in the European Union and bidding in public projects in the European Union. In addition, the European Union also stated that restrictions on the relevant transactions of the service industry will also become possible sanctions.</p>
<p>The reason why the EU introduced the above countercroof tools was that in the past few years, the EU and its member states have become the target of economic coercion of the EU foreign countries many times. For example, <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/立陶宛第一季度对华出口同比下降接近零/a-62141560">China has implemented trade restrictions on Lithuania, and the European Union believes that such restrictions do not meet the relevant provisions of the World Trade Organization, but also have a joint impact on the exports of the EU's internal market</a>Essence It is generally believed that the cause of economic sanctions on Lithuania was that Lithuania had previously upgraded diplomatic relations with Taiwan and allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in the country's capital. This move has caused strong indignation in China, because Beijing has always seen Taiwan Bay as a province in China and does not have an independent state status.</p>
<p>The European Commission stated that the newly introduced counter -tooling tools may have an impact on the EU's future legislation, or at least to avoid the tedious procedures of the EU temporarily opening sanctions. According to the relevant statement, for this purpose, the European Union can introduce additional, discriminatory tariffs, and deliberately delay or refuse to issue permits for specific businesses. Other methods that can be adopted also include additional border inspections and security inspections of goods from specific countries, or resisting goods and investment in specific countries.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/dwzh/2023-06-07T11-53-00Z/63942853_401.jpg" />EU Council Vice Chairman Dongbrovskis: "Anti -Tools will enable us to defend our legitimate rights and interests."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Veatisdombrovskis, vice chairman of the European Commission, who is responsible for economic affairs, said: "This anti -economic stress tool will enable us to firmly defend our legitimate rights and interests." He said, he said, he said, " The final consensus on this counter -tooling tool means that the European Union has taken an important step. East Brovskis emphasized that sanctions should only be used as the last means when they are unsuccessful. It is just a deterrent method. Before taking sanctions, we must first talk with relevant non -EU countries. When the dialogue is unsuccessful, the possibility of mediation, arbitration or judicial trial should also be considered.</p>
<p>Before the anti -economic coercion regulations are officially effective, they need to be approved by the EU Council and Parliament. However, it is generally believed that there is no suspense for the approval of the regulations. The European Commission believes that this new anti -economic stress tool can be officially opened this fall.</p>
<p>At a regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to the EU's "anti -economic stress tool". He said: "First of all, what I want to talk about is about Lithuania's error on the issue of Taiwan -related issues. Our China has repeatedly stated its position. China and the European Union are victims of economic coercion in the United States. The United States and other countries in accordance with the European Union and other countries restrict exported semiconductor production equipment to China. This scientific and technological bullying is seriously impacting the development of the semiconductor industry, which not only harms the interests of China and the EU, but also destroys the rules of multilateral trade rules. , Seriously impact the world economic order. We hope that the European Union and the international community will oppose the economic coercion of the United States. "</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-07T12-02-07-00-00/000000.png" />The economic cooperation and development organizations headquartered in Paris predict that this year's global economic growth rate will reach 2.7%, which is higher than the estimated 2.6%in March, and increases the economic growth rate of the United States, China and the euro zone. But this is still lower than the 3.3%economic growth rate in 2022.</p>
<p>Clarelombardelli, chief economist of Economic Cooperation and Development Organization, wrote in the economic outlook report of Economic Organization: "The global economy is getting better, but to obtain strong and sustainable growth, facing a long way to face the way Walk."</p>
<p>Ronbadley pointed out: "According to the past standards, recovery will be weak."</p>
<p>The Economic Organization forecast for the global economic growth rate in 2024 at 2.9%.</p>
<p>According to the OECD, the decline in energy prices, the resolution of the bottleneck of the supply chain, and the re -opening up earlier than China are expected to help the economic recovery.</p>
<p>However, according to data from the Economic Organization, the core inflation rate after eliminating large fluctuations and energy prices is higher than previous expectations.</p>
<p>The Economic Organization says that this may force some central banks to further increase the cost of borrowing. These central banks have raised interest rates to curb consumer prices.</p>
<p>"Some central banks must maintain a tightening monetary policy until there are clear signs that the potential inflation pressure is weakening."</p>
<p>The OECD also warned that the rise in interest rates around the world "more and more obvious can be felt", especially in real estate and financial markets.</p>
<p>The report states: "As investors re -evaluate risks, credit conditions are tightening, and some financial market areas have begun to show signs of pressure."</p>
<p>The Economic Organization also warned that almost all countries' budget deficits and debt levels were higher than before the epidemic, because they must support the economy to bear the blockade of COVID-19 (2019 coronary virus disease) and the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>"As the economic recovery comes, financial support should be reduced and more targeted as the economic recovery."</p>

<p>The CIA did not immediately reply to the relevant inquiries raised by Reuters.</p>
<p>The Beixi pipeline explosion occurred in the exclusive economic zone of Sweden and Denmark. Both countries believe that the explosion is artificially occurred, but it has not yet determined the planner and executor of the explosion.</p>
<p>Both Washington and NATO call the Beixi explosion as "destructive behavior". Moscow has accused Western investigators of dragging, trying to cover up who is the real behind -the -scenes black hand.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the media in the United States and Germany had reported that investigations and intelligence showed that the explosion of Beixi II Pipeline last September <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/媒体北溪爆炸事件有更多线索与乌克兰有关/a-65697137">may be related to the group of pro -Ukraine</a>Essence But the Ukrainian government and military intelligence officials said they did not participate in the attack and did not know who launched it.</p>

At the same time, Canada criticized Chinese warships to provocate, saying that more warships would patrol the Taiwan Strait. Experts said that the Indo -Pacific strategy launched by Canada has fully reflected Canada's tough attitude towards China.</p>

<p>An internal document of the Canadian government shows that Prime Minister Trudeau(Justin Trudeau)Last falling last fall with the then British Prime Minister Tras(Liz Truss)During the conference call, Trasse mentioned that the United States and the European Union should join CPTPP. Trudeau responded: "This is the importance to setting up such a high threshold to join CPTPP in the UK, which is enough to make it difficult for China to join."</p>
<p>Britain was officially approved to join CPTPP in April this year, and is the first new member to join the trade organization after 2018.</p>
<p>China and Taiwan also applied to join the CPTPP in 2021, and all member states are required for review.</p>
<p>Shen Rongqin, an associate professor at York University in Canada, said that the structure of the CPTPP was designed by the Obama administration in the United States. One of its purpose was to counter China. Some standards and specifications were targeted at China. "For example, for the chapter of state -owned enterprises, it is basically unlikely that China is in line with the state -owned enterprise chapter. You know that Chinese state -owned enterprises today still account for 40%of the national GDP."</p>
<p>Relations between Canada and China continue to be nervous.</p>
<p>Last weekend USS Chung-Hoon and Canadian Navy patrol ships Monterer(HMCSMontreal)During the routine of crossing the Taiwan Strait, it was deliberately cut into the front of the US warship by the Chinese warships.

In order to maintain the peace and stability of the region, we will send more warships to this waters to patrol in this sea -based layout."</p>
<p>The Canadian Conservative Party Bo Lizhi also said: "This is another provocative behavior of the Communist Party of China. We believe that Beijing needs to maintain calmness and stability, rather than deliberately angry. Our Conservative Party is like all Canadians and does not want war, but we want Adhere to your own values and interests. "</p>
<p>Beijing has condemned the relevant countries in the Taiwan Strait, saying that "the United States should reflect and correct the errors."</p>
<p>Shen Rongqin said that since the announcement of the Indo -Pacific Strategy in Canada last year, it can be clearly seen that Ottawa's China policies are no longer weak and afraid of things.</p>
<p>Liao Changren, a Canadian current affairs commentator, also said that the relationship between Canada and China is now in a redirect(reset)the process of. Seeing that China was allowed to join the WTO at that time, China did not improve in political reform, but brought various threats.

So far, thousands of mosques have been demolished or converted in China. Deller said: "Xi Jinping is very worried that these mosques will become a nest that breeds resistance. In the end, only those governments have been approved by the government, and they are monitored by the government and attracted tourists to survive. '</p>
<p>In addition to Islam, other religions are also under tremendous pressure. The commercialization of Buddhist temples is becoming more and more obvious. The cross in the Church of God's Christian Church was demolished, and the priests who were unwilling to cooperate with the government were suppressed and arrested. Zhang Xunmou, director of the Religious Research Center of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2019, said in 2019: "Adhere to the direction of my country's religious Sinicization '. In other words, the party's understanding of traditional Chinese culture will dominate everything: the diversification of religion and culture will be replaced by a little folk characteristics. "</p>

As long as you do not register your unemployment, you will not be included in the statistics of the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>(Voice of Germany Chinese website) In terms of employment, there are two different definitions in Germany. Ms. Olgaschwalbe at the News Affairs Office of the German Federal Labor Bureau said that according to the definition of the International Labor Organization (ILO) on the "ErWerbstätigkeit), people over 15 years of age accept rewards at least one hour per week to engage in a certain industry. The work, or as a freelance industry, is engaged in the handicraft industry, agriculture and other industries, or does not receive wages to help in family enterprises, which belongs to the category of "employment".</p>
<p>For the German Federal Labor Bureau, the Beschäftigung has a stricter prerequisites, which usually refers to employees who pay social security. This includes both full -time employees and semi -employees. But the so-called minijob-monthly income is 520 euros or the number of working days per year is not more than 70 days-not counting within employment. Freelancers and national civil servants are not within the category of "employment" that they are counted.</p>
<p>The German Federal Labor Bureau is also responsible for the statistical unemployment rate. The condition of the statistics within the unemployment rate is less than 15 hours of working hours per week, and registering unemployment from the Labor Bureau to find a job, which means that you can accept a [employment position] at any time.(https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/德最大工会每周工作4天可拯救就业岗位/a-54588035)Essence</p>
<p>Taking the situation in Germany in May as an example. The unemployment rate of the Federal Labor Bureau is 5.5%. The latest employment of the Labor Bureau (March) is about 35 million. The number of "employment" provided by the German Federal Bureau of Statistics at the same time is about 46 million. In other words, the number of "employment" based on width standards is higher than the number of full -time and half -job workers who pay social security.</p>
<p>Ms. Schwab said that the definition criteria for "employment" in international labor organizations are uniformly used in Europe. For employment or unemployment, how many hours do you work per week to count, and countries may be different.</p>
<p>She also introduced that although Liberty did not pay social security in Germany, it was not listed in the "employment staff" statistics statistics from the Labor Bureau, but if they went to the Labor Bureau to register unemployment and were willing to accept a job, then, then, then, then, then, they were willing to accept a job. They will also be included in the category of "unemployment rate". In other words, if they do not register unemployment, they will not be counted within the range of unemployment rates. The same is true for the so -called minijob. If you do not register the unemployment, it will not be included in <a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/zh/ifo疫情在德国至少造成100万人失业/a-52898356">unemployment rate</a>Statistical category.</p>

However, in the recent situation that officials have continued to suppress the literary and artistic circles, and the "cultural management" law enforcement team also appeared in a high -profile appearance of the Internet, experts question Or "forced brainwashing"?</p>
<p>According to the Chinese official media Xinhua News Agency, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a letter to the "First Cultural Power Construction Summit Forum" held in Shenzhen on June 7, congratulating on behalf of the "Party Central Committee".</p>
<p>Xi Jinping said in the letter: "Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we have placed cultural construction in the prominent position of governing the country and governing the country, and continuously deepening the regular understanding of cultural construction, promoting cultural inheritance and development. pace."</p>
<p><strong> Is it "</strong> <strong> firm cultural self -confidence" or "forced brainwashing"? </strong></p>
<p>However, under Xi Jinping, is China really moving towards the so -called "cultural power"? Chen Pokong, a scoreer in the United States, told the station that this was just Xi Jinping's big words. It was not only impossible to achieve, but also moved to the opposite side: "He (Xi) is destroying culture, pulling down culture, and locking the culture in the cage. The so -called 'cultural strong country' is impossible, the 'cultural strong party' or the power of his personal power is possible. "</p>
<p>In Hexin, Xi Jinping also emphasized that "comprehensively implementing socialist thoughts with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the 20th spirit of the party", "firm cultural self -confidence", "stimulate the vitality of the national cultural innovation and creation", "build a strong country, build national rejuvenation, national rejuvenation Inject powerful spiritual power "and so on.</p>
<p>Zhao Lanjian, a former Chinese media person in exile in the United States, believes that from the perspective of psychology, only when people are particularly unconfident, they will emphasize that they are glory, great, correct and confident. "Real self -confidence, it is a bland calmness, not that he needs to strengthen and prominent. Once he wants to emphasize this, we have to think about it. Is he an attempt? He is a natural nature. Culture, or is a mandatory brainwashing? "</p>
<p>Zhao Lanjian also said that a healthy country will not intentionally shape a certain ideological culture: "Everyone who emphasizes culture is the Chinese Cultural Revolution, as well as China's previous movements, and some slogans in North Korea and the past. The words. "</p>
<p>A few days ago, an article signed "Pottery Industry", a "Democratic China" website, said: "The party constantly reminds the people in the domain to have cultural self -confidence. How can it be confident? How can a culture that rely on lies and fear to be confident? "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-06-00-04-00/000002.png" />The cultural law enforcement scope of the Chinese government includes tourism, cultural, publication, radio and television, and film markets (screenshots of Weibo/ancient pavilion)</p>
<p><strong> Strengthen the "cultural management" law enforcement team to maintain ideological security </strong></p>
<p>Recently, the CCP has continuously strengthened the control of the cultural field. First, the talk show actor Li Haoshi was accused of offense the PLA for a joke. The company was also fined more than 14 million yuan. Recently, the CCP's "cultural management" law enforcement team appeared high -profile on the Internet, causing attention. According to the official introduction of China, the cultural market comprehensive administrative law enforcement team conducted administrative penalties for culture, tourism, cultural relics, publishing, radio and television, and film markets, as well as law enforcement functions such as administrative inspections and administrative compulsory.</p>
<p>Chen Pokong, a scorcher in the United States, believes that Xi Jinping's approach follows the CCP's past extreme left route, that is, the replica of the Cultural Revolution: "The Cultural Revolution is also the public propaganda team, the cultural propaganda team, the military propaganda team, etc., to promote Mao Zedong's set, What kind of proletarian revolutionary route and extreme left route, now Xi Jinping is engaged in the same number of roads. "</p>
<p>Chen Kuide, Executive Chairman of the Princeton Chinese Academy, also told this station that Xi Jinping recently talked about the so -called "to adhere to the bottom line thinking and extreme thinking" and "the major test of being prepared to suffer from high waves and even stormy waves", which shows that the current Chinese Communist regime is facing severe rule of rule. In crisis, the "cultural management" law enforcement team is also used to "maintain ideological security and cultural security."</p>
<p><strong> Zhao Lanjian: The difference in beauty is the creative ability </strong></p>
<p>On the day of the "First Cultural Power Construction Summit Forum", the 19th Cultural Fair, known as the "First Exhibition of Chinese Cultural Industry", was also opened in Shenzhen. According to China's "Reading News", a total of 3,596 government groups, enterprises and institutions participated in the exhibition, bringing cultural products in over 50 countries and regions worldwide.</p>
<p>However, under the increasingly severe cultural control of the authorities, does China's cultural industry still have innovation capabilities? Chen Pankong believes: "Now Xi Jinping returns to the Communist Party to make a red set. In fact, this set is a wall, and it doesn't work at all. So the more he trapped himself, but he did not realize this. ","</p>
<p>Former Chinese media person Zhao Lanjian said that the biggest difference between the United States and China is that the United States has continuous creativity, and the CCP has been restricting and stifling this creativity. "The United States will always produce new creative capabilities. Where does the creative ability come from the enlightened and diverse of culture. Once it is closed, the whole society will die, and people will not have creative ability. China is now now.

The British government recently announced that no illegal activities were found after the police investigated all the Chinese "police service stations" in the country, but emphasized that the "police service station" that did not accept the government's permission was unacceptable. These places have been permanently closed. However, China later had another set of statements to discover the British side discredit China.</p>

<p>The British Security Secretary of State Tomtugndhat (Tomtugndhat) on Tuesday (6th) explained the latest investigation of China's "overseas police service station" to Congress in writing. The statement stated that the British police have visited all Chinese "police service stations" in the UK. There is currently no evidence that these "service stations" represent illegal activities on behalf of the Chinese government.</p>
<p><strong> British government: China </strong> <strong> "</strong> <strong> Police Service Station </strong> <strong>" </strong> <strong> Unacceptable </strong></p>
<p>However, Togen Dart emphasized that these "police service stations" are unacceptable anyway: "These 'police service stations' were established without our approval. How low will make those who leave China and seek safety and freedom in the United Kingdom are worried and scared. This is unacceptable. The Chinese authorities often criticize others to interfere in the internal affairs, but they think they can open up the British government and open it. These do not indicate the origin sites. "</p>
<p>Togen Dart said that the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated to the Chinese Embassy in the UK that the "police service stations" located in the UK are unacceptable and cannot operate in any form. He quoted the response of the Chinese Embassy, saying that all these places had been permanently closed and would be accused of investigating relevant British law.</p>
<p><strong> China said that overseas police station </strong> <strong> "</strong> <strong> does not exist </strong> <strong>" </strong> ** non -governmental organizations rebuked</p>
<p>However, the Chinese Embassy in the UK later issued a statement claiming that the so -called "overseas police station" was a "political lie." Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also denied again at the press conference: "We have already expressed their positions on the relevant issues, and there is no so -called 'secret police station' at all. China urges the British side to respect the facts and stop rendering speculation and discrediting China. Don't create obstacles to Sino -British relations. "</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000002.png" />The Chinese Embassy in Britain claims that the "Overseas Police Station" is a "political lie.(Screenshot of the official website of the Chinese Embassy in Britain)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/al-06072023110042.html/screenshot-2023-06-07-145910.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000003.png" /></a>Demolition of the "Safeguard Defenders" of China's overseas "police service station", Lauraharth, responded in writing in writing, saying that when the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to their reports in the past, they have always acknowledged the existence of these overseas bases and Clearing their role is to perform "administrative tasks". It has been checked until now, but the Chinese side does not recognize it.</p>
<p>Reporting by party media. At the same time, the official statement of almost all Western democratic government acknowledged the existence and illegal nature of these 'police service stations'. "</p>
<p>Has pointed out that from the British statement, it can be seen that China closes the "police service station" according to the British requirements and also shows that they do exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000004.png" />Laura Harth, Director of SafeguardDefenders.(Associated Press information picture)  <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/al-06072023110042.html/ap22300329004595.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/rfamandarin/2023-06-07T15-30-00-04-00/000005.png" /></a></p>
<p>The statement said that these Chinese "police service stations" were accused of assisting Chinese overseas citizens to handle administrative affairs as packaging. In essence, they monitored and harassed Chinese diaspora, and were even used to coerce them to return to China.</p>
<p><strong> Followers: Evidence of illegal or early destroyed </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the failure of the British police to find the evidence of the "police service station" to engage in illegal activities, Zheng Wenjie, the founder of the "British Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Association", believes that the relevant evidence may have been destroyed, and it also shows that the British police's intelligence work has loopholes.</p>
<p>Zheng Wenjie said: "It is possible that these CCP overseas police liaison stations have been exposed by non -governmental organizations, and their behavior has turned low -key, so these things have not been exposed after the police intervene. It was blank, so they couldn't have the relevant information immediately before the matter was exposed. "</p>
<p>As a Hong Kong person approved by the British government, Zheng Wenjie believes that people who exile in the UK and avoid the persecution of the Chinese government have reasonable reasons to worry that the Chinese "overseas police station" will be abused to suppress and monitor the dissidents.</p>
<p>For the different claims of the British government and the Chinese side, Zheng Wenjie believes that it may be that the Chinese Embassy admits to the existence of the "police service station" to the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in private. According to the consistent practice, the allegations are denied in public. However, he emphasized that the Fuzhou Police Station and overseas Chinese groups of China have released public news about the "police service station" and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Luke Depulford, Executive Director of the "Transnational Parliament Alliance of China" (IPAC), told this station that the British government clearly pointed out that the Chinese "police service station" is illegal and major measures; He was disappointed that he was disappointed that these "police service stations" may have been removed early after being exposed in September last year.</p>
<p>He believes that the British government should expand the scope of investigation in the next step and investigate China's united front work in the UK.</p>

<p>Modified Time: 2023-06-07T15:20:05+00:00</p>
<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Bangkok, 7th) Thailand has cut off the power supply to the KK park in Myanmar.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-07T15-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />Monsak Kaew-ON, Director of Masod District, told AFP that the Thai authorities cut off the power located in the KAREN KKko Park (KAREN) in Myanmar from the 5th to 6th.</p>
<p>Mona pointed out that after Thailand's contract that supply local power supply, the Myanmar Military Government did not update the contract and therefore cut off power.</p>
<p>The rule of law on the eastern border of Myanmar is weak, and many areas along the border are full of Chinese investment, and it operates casinos, mining and logging in the local area.</p>
<p>The KK Park is a hotel and casino built on Chinese customers. These facilities are operated by the Crathian border defense forces (BGF), a minority militia organization that are linked to the Myanmar government forces.</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse cannot contact the BGF spokesman to get a comment.</p>
<p>According to a report proposed by the US Peace Research Institute (USIP) in 2020, the main supporters of the KK Park are Chinese people who have Cambodian citizens.</p>
<p>The Asia -Pacific International Holdings Group registered in Hong Kong has announced that it has invested $ 15 billion in the Asia -Pacific New Town plans to be part of the Beijing authorities' "Belt and Road" initiative.</p>
<p>The report of the American Institute of Peace states that the characteristics of the development plan include land plunder and the influx of Chinese people to escape Cambodia's suppression of organizational crimes. These groups later set up casinos and money laundering agencies locally.</p>
<p>Xun Zhijiang was detained by the Thai authorities in August last August for illegal operations of illegal online casinos.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese media, since 2012, Zhi Zhijiang has been escaping the pursuit of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Myanmar military government commented on the KK park was not commented.</p>
<p>Due to the old and outdated power transmission grid, power -off is a commonplace in Myanmar, especially in the hot summer month, the situation where the supply is in short supply often occurs.</p>
<p>Burmese national media reported that Myanmar Minister of the Myanmar in the Military Government met with the Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar on May 31.</p>
<p>According to the "Global New Light ofmyanmar", the themes they discussed include "online fraud and gambling of Myanmar -China border and the Myanmar border" and "strengthening cooperation to combat cross -border crimes."</p>
<p>Since Myanmar's independence from Britain in 1948, Klunbon has been splitted by the ethnic minorities rebels fighting with each other.</p>

<p>Regarding China claiming that "the Taiwan Strait is the China Sea, the two warships almost collided because the US warships are provocative", and Raymondkuo, a political scientist of the US Defense Research Consultation Institution Rand Tell reporters that China's claims have fundamental mistakes: "China has a strange understanding of international law, so China's interpretation is often refuted by the United Nations Marine Arbitration Court Committee. It is said that the Taiwan Strait is a channel for international navigation, so I don't think China can occupy and accept the Taiwan Strait as myself. "</p>
<p>Johndotson, deputy executive director of the Washington Think Tank Global Research Center (GTI), also said that China ’s understanding of international law has made international unacceptable:“ China ’s (for sea power) is decoupled from the international marine law. Most of them are based on nationalism, China ’s grievances about history, and their own imagination of their rights ... ... Even if we assume that Taiwan is really Chinese territory (the United States does not recognize this), the Taiwan Strait will not become China's territorial sea."</p>
<p><strong> The US -China Defense Minister condemned each other on the warship incident in Singapore </strong>Li Shangfu pointed out that China does not have any objections to the "harmless passage", but "we must prevent the use of free sailing and harmless attempts through the truth of the hegemony."

<p>Regarding the increasingly risky military behavior of China in the Taiwan Strait recently, Guo Hongjun believes that this may also be related to Kangda's visit to China: "China wants to pretend to be a conflict, the purpose is to retreat in the United States. I don't think Beijing I sincerely hope to start a war. It does not want the United States to retaliate, but it wants to convey to the United States. This is my territory and this is my waters' signal, especially the US State Department of Asia -Pacific Affairs Assistant Secretary of State is visiting China. "</p>

<p><strong> Will the Taiwan Strait wipe the gun due to military accidents? Scholars: Unlikely </strong></p>
<p>The outside world is worried that there are more and more military operations in the Taiwan Strait of the United States, China, and Taiwan, which also increases the risk of accidents that cause the gun to get angry. In this regard, Zheng Zhexuan analyzed that the possibility of upgrading the two sides of the Taiwan Strait because of military accidents is not very likely: "I think the possibility of evolution from military accidents into a comprehensive war in the short term is very low. I am more worried that this will create a diplomatic crisis, so Like the middle and US military aircraft collided in Hainan Island in 2001. "</p>
<p>Weng Luo, an associate professor of the Department of Political Department of Sam Houston State University in Texas, analyzed: "In fact, it is not accidental, but the political decision behind it. The possibility of wiping guns and getting angry is not high. However, if political considerations operate cross -strait issues, the possibility of crisis will increase. In 2024, Taiwan and the United States will enter the presidential election. Interest, I am afraid it is the key variable of stable situations on both sides of the strait. "</p>

<p>As the United States continues to be tough, NATO has also regarded China as a strategic threat. However, the recent transformation of the United States' pursuit of policies from China from "decoupling" to "risks" has triggered fierce discussions on the outside world. Scholars analyzed this Wednesday that it is difficult for the United States and its European allies to form a consistent policy against China, and Europe is still watching how the United States has adjusted its strategy to China.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-05222023090034.html"><strong> G7 releases joint bulletin to focus on China's economic coercion </strong></a><strong>* <a href="https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/junshiwaijiao/tj-05122023093625.html">US think tank discussion: Maintaining India -Pacific peaceful response to Chinese ambitions</a></strong></p>
<p>As China continues to expand its radical military, economic and political influence internationally, whether the United States and its allies can achieve an agreement on how to deal with Beijing and become an important issue for social discussions. Some scholars have observed that European countries and Washington have disagreed in adopting consistent policies against China.</p>
<p>At a online seminar held on June 7, the American academic bilateral "Foreign Policy", Cindy Yu, assistant editor of the British Political Weekly "TheSpectator", said that unlike the toughness of the United States, the European Union, the European Union, Has always dialogue with China with a gentle diplomatic voice.</p>
<p>She said: "In the United Kingdom, our former Prime Minister Tras has been discussing NATO against China from an economy rather than a military perspective. I think there are poor communication between the United States and Europe, or it may not only have poor communication, but the two parties, but the two parties, but the two parties. There is a deviation in knowing China. "</p>
<p>Yu Xiaodan mentioned that Li Qiang, Prime Minister of the State Council of China, will be invited to visit Berlin and Paris in the end of the month. This is the latest effort to ease the tension between China and Europe. She believes that France and Germany are the most important economic participants in China and play an important role among the EU; coupled with the historical reasons of Europe itself, it is difficult for the European Union to form a unified foreign policy.</p>
<p>In addition, she also mentioned the difficulties of the United States and Europe to China: "On the issue of China, a major obstacle to the United States and Europe's unity is the" Reducing Inflation Act ". Many Europeans are dissatisfied with the Bynden government's bill ... This is another reminder to Europeans. Even if it involves Chinese issues, some U.S. priority measures actually cause additional damage. "</p>
<p>A few days ago, China rejected the request of the two countries' defense ministers proposed by the United States in Singapore. U.S. Defense Minister Lloydaustin delivered a speech at the Shangri -La Safety Dialogue on June 3, saying that the United States will continue to cooperate with regional allies to ensure that the Indo -Pacific region will be free to open and jointly respond to Chinese challenges.</p>

In this regard, JamesPalmer, deputy editor -in -chief of Foreign Policy, did not think that the United States would make concessions.</p>
<p>"This does not seem to promote some kind of reconciliation so strongly." He said: "I think this shows to a certain extent that there are real differences in security and trade and diplomacy within the United States system."</p>
<p>Palmo believes that China is still one of the largest trading partners in the European Union, and it is difficult for the United States to essentially take a tough position in China to cooperate with the European Union.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to make Europe acknowledge that China is a strategic opponent or enemy, and it is difficult for the United States to join Europe because Europe is not Asia after all. Although the Quartet Security Dialogue (QUAD) shows the existence of some great power, it is Britain in the UK Colonial accessories ... Europeans do not participate in this game. The essence of their relationship with China is the concern of human rights from trade and a little bit of human rights from different angles. "</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is China -Europe decoupled or the decoupling of China and the United States, Yu Xiaodan and Palmer agreed that this expectation is difficult to achieve with the continued growth of bilateral trade. Yu Xiaodan pointed out that many European governments are still watching how the United States has realized the policy transformation of China from "decoupling" to "risks".</p>
<p>Rhodium Group, a senior adviser to Rhodium Group, said at a hearing at the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the afternoon of June 7 that with China, Russia, which constitutes a war threat to Europe by China support, Europe, Europe, I changed to know China. He told the US legislators that European tough stance can cover up the differences between 27 EU member states and internal European governments, and Europe will implement "de -risk" in practice.</p>
<p>As early as June last year, NATO member states passed the "NATO 2022 Strategic Concept" to identify Russia as the "most direct threat" faced by NATO, while China constituted a "systemic challenge". The first attempt for strategic goals in the next ten years.</p>
<p>On May 10 this year, Robbauer, chairman of the NATO Military Commission Robbauer, emphasized to the outside world again after the alliance national military summit held at the Brussels headquarters in NATO, but NATO does not think that China is a threat, but a challenge. He said that unlike the threat of Russia and terrorist organizations, "NATO has not designated military plans for China."</p>
<p>On June 5th, Jensstoltenberg, the Secretary -General of NATO, was accused of challenging the growing military, economic and political strength of China to NATO during the attendance of an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Norway. Essence</p>

<p>72 -year -old Rosma on Tuesday (June 6) pointed out in the response of the court: "I can't be responsible for losing these 43 jewelery because they have been taken away by the police. If these jewelry is really lost, the police and the government and the government You should bear the loss of Lebanese jewelry dealers. "</p>

<p>The European Commission has approved the world's first respiratory tract syylocar virus (RSV) vaccine Arexvy. It is expected that the vaccine will be launched for the first time in Europe before the high incidence of respiratory virus this fall this fall.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Reuters and Agence France -Presse reported that Arexvy was produced by GlaxoSmot Pharmaceuticals (GSK). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on May 3 that it approved the listing of Arexvy, and the United States has also become the first country to approve the vaccine. The European Commission also approved the use of the vaccine in Europe on Wednesday (June 7).</p>
<p>The Gramos' statement on the day states that the supply of Arexvy in Europe will depend on the suggestions and reimbursement discussions of various countries, and it is expected to be launched before the high incidence of respiratory virus this autumn. However, Grammort's chief business officer has stated last month that Arexvy may not promote large -scale promotion in Europe this year.</p>
<p>Arexvy is mainly suitable for elderly groups over 60 years old. The respiratory tract hypertrophic virus usually causes mild and cold -like symptoms. However, the symptoms may be more serious for those with weak infants and the elderly, as well as those with weak immune systems and potential diseases.</p>
<p>In Europe, respiratory hyperthyceral virus leads to adult hospitalizations over 2760 years of age, of which more than 20,000 people die in the hospital.</p>

<p>The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) slightly raised the forecast of global economic growth in 2023, and at the same time emphasized that the economic recovery still faces a "long road".</p>
<p>Agence France -Presse reported that the economic outlook report was released on Wednesday (June 7), which is expected to reach 2.7%in 2023, which is higher than the 2.6%predicted in the March report, but lower than the 3.6 in 2022 3.6 %. The forecast of global economic growth in 2024 remains at 2.9%.</p>
<p>Clare Lombardelli, the chief economist of Economic Organization, said in the report: "The global economy is ushered in a turning point, but to achieve strong and sustainable growth, it still faces a long way."</p>
<p>She pointed out that from the past standards, the global economic recovery is weak.</p>
<p>Factors such as decline in energy prices and bottlenecks of supply chain, and re -opening up earlier than expected by China help economic recovery. According to the predictions of the OECD, the US economic growth will fall to 1.6%in 2023 and will slow to 1.0%in 2024. The decline in overall inflation rate in the euro zone will help increase actual income and bring economic growth from 0.9%in 2023 to 1.5%in 2024.</p>
<p>However, data from the OECD show that after eliminating the large fluctuations and energy prices, the core inflation rate is higher than previous expectations, which may force some central banks that have already taken interest rate hikes to further increase the cost of borrowing.</p>
<p>The Economic Organization pointed out that "can now" feel more and more obvious "the rise in interest rates around the world, especially in real estate and financial markets.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes that the global economic recovery is still fragile and risks tend to fall down. The uncertainty of the Russian War and its uncertainty on the global impact is a key concern, and the continuous existence of inflation is another key risk.</p>
<p>In addition, the report also pointed out that policy makers need to take decisive actions in macroeconomic and structural policies to achieve more powerful and sustainable growth.</p>

<h1>Sino -Russian trade in May hit a new high after the Russian and Ukraine War</h1>

<p>Description: (Agence France -Presse, Beijing, 7th) According to the data released by the General Administration of Customs today, with the support of Beijing's support for the sanctioned ally Russia, the total trade between China and Russia has soared in May to the Moscow authorities. The highest record.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/rficn/2023-06-07T4-32-08-00-00/000000.png" />According to information released by the General Administration of Customs, the May trade between China and Russia reached $ 20.5 billion in May; of which, the amount of imports from Russia from Russia was $ 11.3 billion.</p>
<p>The official did not explain these data in detail, but it can also be seen in the data that China's exports have fallen for the first time since February, which interrupted the two -month growth trend brought by the recovery after the epidemic.</p>
<p>Affected by global inflation, economic recession in other countries, and geopolitical tensions in the United States and China, weaken the demand for Chinese products.</p>
<p>However, the trade between China and Russia reversed the adversity of the Beijing authorities.</p>
<p>According to the General Administration of Customs, China is Russia's largest trading partner, and the trade volume of the two parties reached a record 190 billion US dollars last year.</p>
<p>At the March summit, to celebrate the "unlimited" partnership between the two countries, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimirputin established the goal of raising bilateral trade to US $ 200 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>Russia Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said last month that Russia's energy transportation to China this year is expected to grow 40%.</p>
<p>Although the Beijing authorities claimed to be neutral in the Russia and Ukraine War, China was criticized by Western countries for rejection of the Moscow authorities and maintaining close strategic partnerships with Russia.</p>
<p>Today's data also shows that even with the decline in trade with most major European markets and the United States, China's exports to Russia in May increased by 75.6%, the largest increase since Russia's comprehensive invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>With the shrinking of China's manufacturing activities for two consecutive months in May, these data highlight the weaknesses of China's second largest economy in China.</p>
<p>Today, it is reported that the Chinese government has demanded several banks in China to reduce the deposit interest rate to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that this move may show that the People's Bank of China is considering the fastest rate of interest rate cuts this month.</p>
<p>ANZ Banking Group, Khoongoh, said that these numbers are another batch of disappointing information and "will trigger concerns about growth and exacerbate more policy support for policies."</p>

<p>The purpose of the two agreements is to consolidate the status of Australia as the preferred security partner of the Pacific Ocean, and China also tries to please these countries.</p>
<p>Vannuda Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau said on the 6th that some of his country believes that the agreement reached with Australia last year may give the Australian military too much power.</p>
<p>He said: "We must eliminate the stigma of the agreement that is one -sided and does not reflect the sovereignty of Wannanu."</p>
<p>Calza ’s comment was proposed after signing a draft security treaty with Australia in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister JamesMarape said that some clauses that did not explain infringed the country’ s “sovereign right”.</p>
<p>He said that Australian officials have been required to re -formulate drafts and call it a work that is undergoing.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea signed a national defense cooperation agreement with the United States in May, triggering students' protests and calling for increasing transparency.</p>
<p>Due to the increasingly fierce competition between China and Western countries, many Pacific countries are still working hard to deal with the problems left over in the past colonial history.</p>
<p>The China and the Solomon Islands signed a secret security agreement last April. Australia was caught off guard and has been busy strengthening the relationship with the Pacific neighbors since then.</p>
<p>The South Pacific has a channel and marine resources. If a war occurs in Taiwan, the South Pacific may become an important military battlefield.</p>
